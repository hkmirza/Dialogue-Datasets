i right now my car is terminally ill so i am really looking at facing the purchase of a car
and you know i don't even like the wind blowing on me so i don't know why i think i want one but i do
i will probably stay with a foreign make i've had real good luck with them
is that right
oh i didn't realize it i knew that one of the
that nissan which is toyota had joined with
had a plant over here and i didn't know if it was general motors or who
i don't know you think of chevrolet and the good old usa
huh
well yeah and that's minimum
it you know it's a major purchase now what we used to pay for homes
is now what a car can cost
if they held their value that would be one thing but when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated
i don't know that i'll go with i've bought a new car the last three that i've bought and i don't know that i'll buy a brand new one again
well i'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car
well some people you know some people have to have a new car every year
or it you know at the most every two years and they don't drive them that much
especially your foreign cars
yeah like a honda or a toyota fifty thousand is just getting broken in for them
and if i can find one or a repossession
and with the banks being in such financial you know problems now that people you can find the banks willing to sell you a car
we live in a one story just like a ranch style home you know the standard texas fox and jacobs
how about you guys
are you in a apartment or a house
well they say that those are easy to or difficult to find
how are rents doing i haven't looked at rents in a long time
uh-huh
what's a what's a one bedroom are you in a well plano most complexes in plano are pretty nice so you're probably in a you know
um-hum
ooh that does get high yeah i mean
yeah i was going to say our mortgage is between depending on you know it drops seems like in the last six months we got lucky and we refinanced and it but it was like eight hundred and something but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty
so that's really not i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a townhouse in yeah in actually they're near plano in north dallas too but i couldn't believe it but you know
yeah
and then i think that nobody was really buying homes for a long time there because of just i mean we've been in ours for about ten years but there's no investment in it you know
on your
on your taxes yeah that's really about it it's have you ever owned your own home
so you know what it's like yeah it's like when you first this is our third one it's not and it's not that exciting after a while
yeah suburban track yeah
uh-huh
yeah it's really it's really sad because they're not doing anything well we're getting off the subject i guess but just like with housing i mean they're not doing anything about pollution they're not doing anything about it's going to look like have you ever been to houston
you know i used to think dallas was better than houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a now it looks just like houston to me you know
we've been in here ten years
yeah so we've got you know we've got some investment in it but you really don't get anything out of it
yeah smaller we were up in pittsburgh pennsylvania
my home town the prices
actually a lot better because pittsburgh is about the size i'm trying to think like a louisville or minneapolis that type of size
and the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy five eighty
yeah it's really and we didn't think it was that clean but then after you're gone for a while it looks cleaner you know
yeah saint louis whatever
really
i guess it's yeah but and here i guess it depends on what you want you know here once people like i know a lot of people that work for jc penney in marketing
and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you're talking about they had no they had a lot of property but not a lot of house and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it
yeah
yeah and a lot of them i know a couple women that work there and they don't miss in public relations and they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to you know
uh-huh
yep
that's exactly growing i grew up in western pennsylvania near pittsburgh and we used to call the basements actual cellars so it's funny to hear that word because i never hear it you know it's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know
but the housing is just we like the older homes and i don't know if we're going to stay here or not depends you know i mean
pardon me
yeah actually when we were up north but some family things changed so we ended up coming back down here and all that because it helped my husband's work but
we really would like to but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here you know it
yeah it it's real tough i mean the economy any more i mean i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything you know it's pardon me
yes i do
no we don't
a live out nanny but any rate i don't have any of that i don't know it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know
we have a
yeah we have a dog and we're pretty i mean we're not fanatically neat but we keep things up you know it's not like where there's three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring
no we're pretty much we we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wallpaper together
and things like that we pretty much hire we subcontract mostly everything i mean other than anything that's not a i mean i know how to fix a running toilet
he does what he needs to but mostly if it's something major you know cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that
and how'd that go
uh-huh
getting to agree to things that i'm sure and i also think that once you get to be you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older
you start the dollar value on things
i you know i think people that own homes a lot in north dallas are very materialistic
yeah that's
i mean and you know you see a lot of these people that came east from west from new york with exxon or jc penney and it's just a hoot to watch them
right exactly so well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house
oh my goodness yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well in a way you can travel light
how is how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that
uh-huh
yes i do
everybody pretty much keeps to their own turf so to speak
yeah
uh-huh
yeah relax and try to go to sleep really yeah
and i think plano in general is getting a little more well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right
isn't that something yeah the price of home now we paid
oh we paid about seventy eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago and
i'd say they appraised it it's gone up you now maybe like five percent
so it's an investment but it's something that you know when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something but you really it's just real nowadays with the way income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize
yeah exactly we
yeah and even you know i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a track home you know i mean we had one of their homes that was nicer in pennsylvania but it was an older home but then you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up
so you know
um-hum
well i'll tell you i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than i do now
i do i do the easy stuff now i change oil
and then what some people would consider a little more difficult i i'll change spark plugs and
i'll change you know points and you know air filters that kind of stuff
but i can't do as much as i used to i used to do a whole lot more but not anymore they're just too weird to work on now
well that's part of it yeah part of it is like you said i don't have time
um-hum
but fortunately that was covered under the warranty
hm
um-hum
um-hum
did you take it to a dealership
uh-huh
oh i see
right
oh gosh it's gonna have to run for a for a while yet
do you work for ti no okay
oh
yeah
yeah
oh yeah i'm planning on it oh it can't be any worse than last year that's for sure
yeah i'm gonna try and plan on it
all right well i enjoyed the conversation
all right thank you
do you have any elderly relatives currently in a nursing home now
do you i have a grandmother she's a hundred and two
she'll be a hundred and three in august
and we decided not to put her in a nursing home
she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town and then my sister takes care of her
she even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties
she still has her snap she takes care of her own business this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker
but with somebody that needs around the clock care i have seen my family age
i've seen them in the she's been there ten years now and i have seen them age twenty in the time and with the expense and everything i still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home
and they needed some quality care i would put someone in a nursing home
um-hum
oh that is great
why yeah i'm sure you have got some really good nursing homes around dallas
um-hum i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in austin
where
and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have we have to be a pauper
it takes every penny they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your care and that's the sad part about it
um-hum i think that's what most people do you just have to give it everything away
i work at a brokerage firm and i have seen so many people that just have to gift
you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home
i can't imagine i'm twenty nine and everybody in my family's always had we don't have any children everybody that has them later in life so my mother and my father are in their late sixties
oh i know
it but yeah most people aren't
and that's the bad thing i would hate to have lived so long she lived by herself
my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety one
and just did everything and it but most people aren't
yeah well
i oh i'll say this first i'm certainly for conversion to the metric system unfortunately i'm not sure how well grounded my feelings for that are maybe it's
just because it's a highly regular system and you don't have to worry about whether something is five thousand two hundred and eighty units or
i'm just going to walk over here and stop my cats from doing what they're doing and the metric system is you know
you it has so many different prefixes like autometer and femtometer and stuff like that you don't need them just use the you know the meter the kilometer you know whatever it's i don't know that that's i think that's its primary
primary use is that
and of course in scientific uses things like the like a mile or i'm not a pound have some use whenever you try to combine them into formula then you have to
have conversion constants and things like that so most of the formulas although they are some that don't obey this rule
most scientific formulas can be adapted with the metric system because of the way things are interrelated that you'll need those extra conversion constants
like a cubic let's see what is it a cubic centimeter of water is also a gram of water at standard temperature and pressure
um-hum
right
right
yeah that's true
well it happens first well it i guess it happens first in either of the two places i guess either in the school or just products
one thing about a lot of us products i'm just looking at something here shaving cream that is not in this case
list both what they are in the english or british imperial system whatever it's called units and the metric system units so this just says seven ounces
i think i've heard that in canada what they did was primarily they didn't change the size the sizes that various products came in they just changed the way they were annotated
so something before was you know and see you have things in odd measurements that's even true like for film and like you know sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter film
those odd things come about i'm not sure exactly what they are because it's like a half inch or whatever they just
you know they say okay this is a european thing too
not too important but i think at least in northern or northeastern schools they people are relatively well inducted into the metric system
anyone who takes you know chemistry physics anything like that in school i think in most cases it's done in metric system it was for me
yeah when you tell somebody liters bottles of coke yeah
that's true that is and oddity
oh no i hadn't heard about bo jackson though what happened
yeah plays for the raiders
i didn't know that
well
yeah it does he has more money out of the ads than he does the game itself
i well i think joe montana got something like a million dollars for saying i'm going to disneyland
outrageous prices
i wouldn't know what to do with it
we just discussing what we'd do with five thousand
the
achievement for the let's see how are they putting that the school let's see the academic board review board the dean's being it more involved with the athletes
yeah i was watching that
yeah well
some of for most of the people i guess it is for some of them though they do it just for the love of it
well that's not necessarily true though you know
i'm an avid basketball fan of bull
and i know that the coach there gets a million dollars when he quits
or you know and so you know he's doing it because he wants to
yeah i heard about that i haven't heard much about it though
yeah
yeah -t's yeah it's helping the kids
it's happened too much
i hope so
it's happened to me more than once
yeah almost all the time
i haven't had anything on fishing i've had
oh arts and crafts football basketball and baseball
child rearing or child day care
and couple other things i can't remember
half-and-half
oh you know i had to start out doing it i done it about five times and then here lately they i've been letting them catch me
all right well you take it easy bye
well gosh it set up on a scale of one to ten
you know i think i would too i think i'd straddle the fence
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well
right yeah
uh-huh
right yeah
oh well see i agree with you it seems like the crime rate has gone up even more here this year they're talking about there're more murders in dallas almost since last year and
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah you know waiting seven days so that they can make sure that check it out and everything's okay and to me that was that was perfectly acceptable
you know because if you are a law-abiding citizen you're not going to want to you know it's not going to matter to you if you have to wait a little while
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah no i don't think that they should ban it i really don't you know i don't have a gun in the house myself because i have children and you know feel really uncomfortable about that but if i was by myself i'd definitely have a gun
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh okay
uh-huh yeah so that's a great
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah but see these people i know they keep them up underneath their pillows you know sitting right on top of their dresser drawers i mean it's no wonder you know the kids get in there and then they blow other people away so you know
um-hum
oh yeah oh yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah so that yeah but that that's about the biggest reason why i just never and i won't even let my son play with play guns either you know not even get that idea about them
yeah there you go there you go that's right there you go yeah me too
uh-huh
hello
hello
yeah
berkeley california
this is carla in sherman texas
good how are you doing
yeah okay
okay
yeah
yeah i love football professional
right well i'm not really originally from texas but professional football is my favorite thing to watch really
yeah exactly i do like what's his name
what's who's the quarterback out there
oh yeah i do like him
uh-huh
oh really
so they're not going to be as good this year huh
oh yeah
yeah
not at all not at all i'm really a bandwagon fan i think i like whoever is good that year
yeah i you know
yeah so i so i liked the forty niners last year
but i like watching the colts play because i'm from originally from indiana and
yeah
the colts
yeah
yeah
yeah i know a lot of people do but
we like jeff george so it's fun to watch him play being a rookie and all last year
yeah
uh-huh
well they did the wrong thing by releasing landry a few years ago
i know
i liked tom landry you know i have no respect for the for the new coaching staff since they ousted him
oh not i know not at all
yeah
so
well
well i have to admit i don't keep up with texas i keep up with i'm from purdue
and so i keep up with what's going on up there they're going to have a new coach this year from ohio state
and they it looks to be promising for purdue within the next few years so we're looking forward to seeing their program turn around
yeah
that's how it how it goes i guess
yeah
uh-huh
right
what are they going to do about bo this year
yeah
right
oh yeah some people think they're predicting that he'll make a big comeback
yeah i would be too
yeah
uh-huh
right ti somehow got us on it
yeah
yeah
or any football
uh-huh
you played football for north carolina
where where'd you go to college
oh did you
well great what year was that then
long ago huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
oh yeah definitely i understand that
yeah you too and i hope the forty niners do well this year
thanks
okay
you -kay okay bye-bye
right
well now that's not so far this year is it or is that
oh i see uh-huh
that's i think that's the most of the murders anywhere i think yeah
well we have our share of murders down here i don't know i i'm
i've been here for five years and i don't know this kind of things don't hit national news very often but seems like down in florida there's a lot of strange crimes and murders that happen
i mean really off the wall stuff just a couple of weeks ago these people rented a house and the pool in the backyard of this house was kind of like a pond it was all green had you know algae grown over it
and so they were cleaning it up and the guy hit something he couldn't see what it was and so he dragged it up into the shallow end and it was a garbage can and inside the garbage can was a body
maybe i just don't remember it or maybe the media in illinois didn't expose it the way the media does down here
right
i bet
yeah they have it here also
no actually the university of florida in gainesville which is about two or three hours from where i live there's been
there's been serial killers there for the last two to three years and they'll go through one two three four six seven eight girls they caught one guy and then no sooner had they caught him and convicted him
a few months later there was another serial killer killing these college age girls that are living on the campus down there or
he had buried a lot of young boys teenage boys on his property you know he'd raped them and killed them and buried them and some yeah like ten twelve years ago this was this happened right
oh i bet that's just a madhouse i can't imagine
that's incredible yeah
yeah
right
a friend's house it was it was the guy and the boyfriend of the girl that had a
oh really
you don't believe in it
yeah
very black and white opinions you know there's no gray in her opinions you know she probably would agree more with you but i don't know i think
get out and do it again i've never had a punishment or a crime like a murder touch my immediate family but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to
punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done and we see that more and more like in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who
raped and then killed a seven year old girl you know that's fourteen years old what's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult
yeah
no it doesn't but it costs less
and yeah to me it is i mean i work and i pay my taxes and i lived out in texas for a little while and they're
it that's a pretty heavy state compared to georgia i mean you guys are a lot more for to each his own even than we are in georgia but even in georgia
that's the attitude for the most part if i work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine
but when i've got to work to pay my dues and your dues
then i don't like you very much anymore
oh really
yeah
you might be right
i mean i i'd hate to be the person to pull the switch you know i would never in a million years want that job but i do believe it's necessary and i on the one hand i guess i admire the person who has the
guts to do it because i couldn't i couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing and i couldn't pull the switch but i
yeah
right
uh-huh
what
good way of punishing
yeah
been playing on my computer
and
lately
well let's see last book i read was a science fiction book called weapon
it his first book i think not very popular
yeah
yeah what books are you into
um-hum
um-hum
no i sure haven't read that
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
hm
um-hum
oh yeah
that's a good book
um-hum
uh-huh
the last series i read was
power that preserves and have you ever read those by donaldson
yeah with the leper
yeah
yeah
what do you mean
yeah
i'm into neural networks and
artificial intelligence
neural networks and artificial intelligence
it's kind of what i've been studying in school and stuff
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
red
uh-huh
hm
uh-huh
yes
all right
uh-huh
um-hum
hm
um-hum
what's that about
yeah
yeah it's a good movie
i liked the movie
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
huh
huh
uh-huh
that's weird
yeah thanks for calling
all right i'll remember that all right bye
oh okay
throw them in the back
cap
oh yeah
there you go
yeah you're
right yeah i know
yeah you're looking at i got a toyota four runner i wanted a truck that i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too so i got a four runner
no
yeah
right
right
yeah my the pretty much the same i got a like i got one of those toyota four runners
and it pretty much does everything i need it to i mean it it'll tow three thousand pounds so i can tow everything and it i can throw i've had eleven people in it before
believe it or not -nd
it's real reliable i mean i've had it for almost four years now and up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it
and then of course two weeks ago it decided i don't know it's the strangest weirdest thing in the world but it blew a head gasket
didn't do any damage to it i caught it real early
no never overheated it i smell i smelled the i smelled the coolant
went out and looked saw it was coming saw where it was coming from drove it right to the shop and left it off
which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and it's not raining
i know but i bet you he really enjoys riding it
yeah so you know you how when was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to go driving
yeah
and i go out twice a week on the bike so at least just for the enjoyment
but yeah i mean the only thing i think i might get in a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car i would consider going to a non
to a normal pickup rather than a covered pickup like the one i got just because there's a lot of times i wished i had the just an open bed to throw stuff in
i'm sure i'm sure that that's very i mean you got one it's that's really convenient be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and
right
-nd to have it out of the way right
i think they last a lot longer than anything else
yeah the trucks do even though you know the jap the little jap trucks are good there too but so are the though i think the chevys i don't think the i don't like the chevys as much as i like the fords
a friend of mine just bought or bought like a year ago it's a really a nice truck i mean i don't like dodges at all but one of the dodges they have out now has a the cummins turbo diesel in it
ah it's beautiful that thing that thing will last forever i mean
oh yeah that thing's it's got a boat engine in it
uh-huh
go ahead
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
right
i think that might be talking referring to
something kind of alternative to the draft you know either you have
military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years
right
hm right
um-hum
right
yeah i
yeah for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative public service for young people to go into after high school
kind of in lieu of the draft for people who don't
who you know are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise wanna
be in the military you know say okay well you can go into the military or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and
learn about things and it's interesting because i i'm not a particular fan of the military
but i have seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that don't have
really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined you know even just personal discipline about what they want to do and
they come out and they at least have now they have at least some marginally marketable skills
and more discipline and they have you know in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say they can see that you know if i do something
pursue submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time i can accomplish a lot and it it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn
that they don't need to be you know cowboys they don't need to be out there and
you know constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished
and you know for some for some young men that's good for me it would have been lousy idea because i did have the personal discipline and i went to college four years and got out you know so
but you know for some people that's good i don't particular like the fact that it's the military you know and because the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as an instrument of us foreign policy
that's another debate but it's
um-hum
right and well it's
it seems pretty aggressive oriented i mean you look at the last military action which was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states
and it was you know it was definitely a projection of us power
on the other side of the globe
so at any rate this is getting off the topic but my point was that there is for people who don't want to do the military service there
it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and sense of community
that do i guess the boy scouts
oh geez i i'm a teacher
not so much they climates out
it is it's unbelievable usually we layer our clothing
and that way we have you know we can strip off layers
and not so much our pants but you wear a sweater and a short sleeve shirt underneath that
and then you can take the sweater off
or something that's medium weight
and especially up here we get the you know we get winters and it's really cold and sometimes in the classrooms it's really cold too
so sometimes you just leave your jackets on all the time
you know so
not that often because a lot of things get stolen
and a sweater if you're wearing slacks and if you're wearing a over the dress you wear a you know a cardigan or something over the dress
and you know bring your jacket you can just carry it around with you
yes we can and
um-hum
well we have a really big high school so it's you know it gets very uncomfortable on hills
most the teachers have taking to wearing track shoes
you know sneakers and
uh-huh
right
no
right
oh really
oh that happens a lot i know my aunt was director she just retired was director of nurses at the hospital up here
and she always wore a cap and
oh yeah she was like a real hold out
and then finally she took that off and that was like big concession on her part
and she always wore her you know uniform shoes never wore sneakers
yeah that's what she was saying
one thing i've noticed that's come back here are clogs
uh-huh
oh neat
oh that sounds great
really
um-hum
right a lot of us during the winter would wear boots and then peel them off and carry our shoes
you know or just wear the shoes in and hope for the best
hum things have plowed pretty well
oh really
uh-huh yeah my parents just came up from florida and they had to get rid of all their a lot of their summer clothes
well hopefully we seem to be running on mild winters lately
yeah we're getting a lot more rain and ice than we are snow
and that makes it difficult on as far as clothing goes because you don't know what to put on your feet
we take several at home i take skiing magazine and i take discover magazine and also cd and stereo review
and national geographic i think
i presume that i do i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because i do get things from ski associations and things
at during the year
where you can go and new equipment that's come out and so forth some fashions are always in there too
probably not we already knew we wanted to take one and we just started looking around
i may have referred to a couple of them but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information and picked up a lot of brochures
and just decided to go to crested butte we hadn't been there before
it's kind of away from the crowd that's why we chose that one it's supposedly low lift lines but i haven't skied utah yet but i want to
like to go to sundance and park city and some of those i understand deer valley is nice too
well how about you what magazines do you have at home
oh okay
does it have articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth
well that's good it's good to get use out of one
where my son -ll need to refer back through
forty eight back issues to find you know france or something or whatever it is he's looking for
i used to take smithsonian too and i liked that magazine but it was i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it you get so many coming in and
by the time the next round comes in i'm still not through reading the first round
because oh scientific american comes to our house too i forgot that's mostly my son's but he but i do read it too and so
you know crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that and he likes to try that and so
oh yeah they're just kind of getting started now with there
oh okay so you've got a little bit of a gap there between the little ones
um-hum
yeah i agree with you yeah
yeah
yeah i agree with you there yeah usually i think it's not even the manufacturer so much as it's where you yes well like where with you buy your stuff i guess a lot of your stuff mail order
right
right yeah
yeah
yeah i agree with you
yeah
right
yeah it's true that's happened to me i'm i mean i've gone when walkman's first came out i think i had i bought two when they first came out i just a radio one and then i had a radio and a cassette one and or just the cassette one
and the one was panasonic and the other one was like not even a brand name but those both lasted me for like three years and then i mean then within the past year and a half two years i've probably gone through about six of them
they're just
uh-huh
yeah i mean that's really
yeah
yeah you know and how about these places where you go like out in silo i think it's silo no
there is a store the appliance store i don't i don't think i think their local is just western pennsylvania but whenever you go there they try to sell you the insurance you know
right
right
yeah they really try to you know tack on another fifty sixty dollars
okay so are you a golfer or are you a spectator
well i'm the same way i go out there and hit the ball
yeah
well in the carolina's it's just you know we've got a bunch of golf courses around here
well i mean i'm not a serious golfer at all a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and i don't have a i don't really even have a game
i usually when i go out and play golf it's usually like at a at one of these par threes that you know you
but
i like watching it on tv
well i if i can i can hit a great deal like
they my friends to get me they say i hit worm burners because i can't hit it up in the air so i'm pretty bad but i get great distance hitting it you know for it going across the ground
and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because i'm but i'm getting better i've got where now i can hit it in the air some of the time
yeah so i'm kind of a novice at it
yeah if you get if you get down on the ground you really can
well if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it
not kill it but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's you know because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction
yeah
yeah
yeah
but i
i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it takes me awhile to get to the hole but
well it usually takes me about
probably two to or three to get it there and then that's according to the hole and it maybe one or two putts it's according to where i'm at on the green
but the friends i play with they play all the time and they're really good
they're not joe pros but they golf in the
yeah for eighteen
yeah
i was just now told that's what the topic was and i guess invasion of privacy
to me for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards
for example
and i guess recently
one of the tv stations here
ran a series of news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers
and use it and i was quite surprised at that
i guess i can consider myself fortunate that it never happened to me
i don't know what i'd really do if it did
no not really because i'm listed in the phone book if i was the type of individual that had an unlisted number i think i would be hesitant to give it
one of the things that upset me when i lived in california was they did a lot of things with your social security number
as a matter of fact they even went to the point of printing your social security number on your driver's license
and they would not cash checks unless they had your social security number so we had our social security numbers imprinted
on our checks
and i was really you know unhappy about that situation i think that was an invasion of privacy
right
one of the biggest things i think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of mail lists and things like that
you know recently we i purchased some magazines us news
and forbes magazine
and every since that day i have been inundated with
you know subscriptions to this subscriptions to that this news letter this investment letter
even to the point of people calling me at home and prior to me ordering these magazines i never got those kind of calls
and
um-hum
from some list yeah
um-hum
right
all their time
sure
i think the general public would be you know tremendously upset if they knew
how easy it is for
let's say the criminal individuals to get access to people's records
their credit cards driver's licenses checks things like that
i don't think anybody really knows what to do about it
computers ha caused a lot of this i'm sure
sure
seems as though they are yeah
unfortunately
fortunately i haven't
been inundated with that situation yet
well that sounds good
i've heard the name and that's about all it goes
yeah that's one problem with the nursing home environment it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
you know they don't always have their full wits about them they're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on
and it can be pretty sad i've
got a had a grandmother who had a stroke and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died
and you know it's the type of thing that she was living down in florida my families was up in maryland
and the other part of her family was up in new york state
and you know it was very difficult for either of them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was
you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke
and you know the nursing home was the
you know best facility to put her in
you know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my aunts and uncle work
which means it's you know very difficult for you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full time
and you know there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in home
which makes it you know it's a necessary evil i think
yeah
yeah and you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry
and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford to put in the care that they need
because it's you know an elderly person can
you know it's like a newborn baby you need to have twenty four hour care
answering all the needs because they can't do much for themselves at certain points
uh-huh
and you know there's a lot of number of the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be
and remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can
and it very hard for them to accept that
we just moved my grandfather into
not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility
more of a retirement home he's got his own efficiency apartment and they provide one meal a day
and you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him but they do have you know group activities going on
he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in florida
you know to move into that facility we moved him from florida up to maryland and
it's a bit of a shock to the system weatherwise if nothing else
well there was stuff like that in florida but
um-hum
well i don't actually live in the city but i'd probably say that's roughly right i mean
crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life but i think with the current war on drugs
and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution and sale of drugs
um-hum
where i live no it's not so bad i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it
just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this
i live out in the country yeah
i am about fifteen miles out
um-hum
hm
hm
um-hum
um-hum
wow
that's huge
um-hum
um-hum
are they are there any theories on why this is happening
um-hum but why is it happening
um-hum
um-hum
so they're professionals
hm
um-hum
um-hum
hm
well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime
um-hum
um-hum
right but that mean that's gonna tend to
i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place
right they're doing that in our state
so you think that would be a deterrent
um-hum
well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty
right so you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody
um-hum
right
oh wow
oh my goodness
um-hum
um-hum
right
wow
did you did you sue him under the civil system
did you sue him under the civil system
well you probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him and
yeah makes you wish they had still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing
yeah that's too bad
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
that's awful
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes just
yeah
um-hum
oh my god
hm
right
um-hum
i mean that sounds that's a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake hear you break in and you're gonna get shot
um-hum
hm
wow
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
i mean i tend to agree with you i think what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it
and worry about these things where people are getting hurt and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is
you know and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just don't protect them
i know and i think i think that's
of all the materials we use and things like cans and bottles and stuff like that it's just a complete waste you know make them and then throw them away and bury them out in a dump somewhere when you can just as easily melt them down and reuse them
and there's a i mean there's so many products that are like that it's just too bad that they can't find more that we could recycle
yeah you're right there but then there's things like the newspaper market where they try and recycle as much as they can and then they no one -ill
yeah
or it ends up costing a lot more to recycle it than it does just to make it so
oh yeah i go to indiana university here and its real big and all the buildings are recycling bins for all kinds of materials
yeah and also the well the university's really big about it they have contests in the dorms and stuff to see who can recycle the most stuff
yeah within the school and also the city here has
yeah monthly curbside recycling
uh-huh
right
right
right but then you do don't you get paid when you take your own
uh-huh
right sounds like you are an avid recycler
are you
uh-huh
right yeah we do that at work too
right
uh-huh
right
well aren't there pop cans that are like that also
because they have mixed metals or something
-ell no not really
okay
you too bye-bye
all right
feelings on what caused the s and l
crisis
have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where
loan were made that appear to be
a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during
the reagan eight years
more and more s and l simply began to take riskier and riskier loans
and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of property values devalued
right i don't have a field for whether or not
this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome
scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever
i vaguely recall but i've never gone and done any study on it since the s and l thing that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the hoover years
where gobs of land was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that appeared to be corruption within the hoover administration i don't have a real since
of like corruption that caused s and l all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour
maybe
uh-huh
yeah
it seems like there were on awful a lot of people
making loans and business decisions
on a
get rich quick is the wrong phrase but
if it captures some of the feeling i have from the people making
business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back i'll move on to this other company or
i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were making the decisions for and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move
you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on
or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didn't they didn't care any more i
it
okay
well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk
oh okay
uh-huh
okay
well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and
nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that
that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up
it was escalating in terms of the damage did is your sense that we now understand how bad it is
or is there more to be heard yet
uh-huh
to be caught in the land slide
do you think to possibly is that it'll happen with the regular banks
it seems that i recall reading for the last
oh let's say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks
of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like mexico venezuela
and argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had gone south
resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done
the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans
i have this vague since that could happen
that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost
um-hum
and so you think that it's just gone
okay
do you think it is necessary to have the
federal guaranty program
like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors
which i don't think is what it was meant to do
so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected
the possibility exists for these sorts of
of problems
so your since is that the
that the
the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money
and given that the s and l's have had disasters then those account holders are their money is still being protected
and that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of
of dollars being protected
it's if you take
ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred billion dollars and we're taking about monies way in access of that now so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts
and perhaps multiple people in multiple s and l's
and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought
you know that the for
i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on accounts but i feel likes it's on an individual basis someone whose got
accounts in thirty five different s and l's or
uh-huh
i guess i don't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any s and l's and let alone any of them that went bankrupt
and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means i'm not worried enough
it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then i then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things
uh-huh
well perhaps if there are regulatory
constraints put back in place
it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation
i think in some professions it's essential things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly
um-hum
oh my goodness
i mean
um-hum
right
because they don't want to lose that lucrative career
um-hum
right
um-hum however here in dallas we had a player roy tarpley on the mavericks team
and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing and was to the point he is on probation
it's to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract and they wouldn't have to pay him and the mavericks wanted to get rid of him but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract
and i just recently he was
missing from practice and whenever he missed like that usually he had some kind of problem and so a mandatory drug test was done was positive so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract
and so in his case he lost his whole career he's been in the paper in jail and it's just been awful and i talk about a terrible role model
oh my goodness
um-hum
oh that's terrible
um-hum
um-hum
i think most of us are
um-hum
yes if you know someone for example we have some friends whose son was driving home from work was hit head on by a drunk driver the drunk and his wife in the car were killed
and bobby missed his whole junior year of high school
he went through surgery after surgery and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again and he as far as his athletics he's lost all of that
he has been tutored and he'll catch up in school and everything but he's still not back where he was he may never have all those motor skills back
no
another thing that we saw here recently one of some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a train track ran through
and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train
well he the train missed him but a big mirror type thing sticking out like a metal thing sticking out hit him in the head
he was in a coma for four months he's out of the coma now and eventually they think he will come back
but you don't know that but he's lost he was an outstanding football player
um-hum
hm
my grandmother is
did that as long as we could but again the process is very difficult even
you know i think that my parents did a good job at it when they went through but it's not an easy thing when they've got alzheimer's but my other grandparents
type thing in pennsylvania already my father's much older than my mother so
well no i guess it anyway my other grandparents are much younger and
they what they did is they sold their house and bought a house
figuratively speaking in this retirement complex and they live in that house
and there there's minimal because they you know they bought it they've kind of bought into the whole system and there's care given for the lawn and stuff
and as they get older more care can be given and there's some minimal fees that they'll always be paying but the basic fee for health care and all that is already taken care of
and when they get too old they can move into an apartment instead it's like a duplex they have now
they can move into an apartment and then later nursing
um-hum
yeah
my other set of grandparents has done and my parents have already kind of like gone on a waiting list cause it's such a long thing because it preserves the dignity
of the you know the whole situation and it's a decision that my parents have made and it won't be a drain on our resources because it'll mean just
you know sell selling their house now and buying into that at the same time
and it's familiar
um-hum
yeah
yeah actually i guess i am it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion
it's plywood face i guess but i cut it out in the shape of a crayon box and then i painted about eight different
colors you know the crayons that are sticking up it'll be the headboard and
oh yeah uh-huh now i just have to finish it though i got it got delayed for a little bit and because of work and now i've got to jump back in and finish the
because i've got it all cut out it's all i've done most of the coloring but i've got to go a second layer with the yellow
oh
oh okay
that's great what type of art do you focus on
huh
yeah kind of jack of all trades master of none
that's great
right you wanna explore a new field or
huh so you have an mfa in what division of art
yeah
oh yeah
huh
yeah
oh that's great
huh
yeah exactly
oh yeah
and your time then you're that much farther ahead
right i've seen them and then the watermelon the red with the with the seeds painted in and that's neat
yes we have one
huh
oh i'm sure
band saw
uh-huh
right
a cradle for it yep so you can steady it and then you used a handsaw or a backsaw
right
yeah
right now did you cut a quarter wedge in this
well i'm envisioning a watermelon like a log
and then what i've seen of this kind before is you have the it's if you're looking at adding on you have a complete
oh we have one rotten cat
yeah it's my son's cat
well i like cats this cat is a more like a dog
yeah he's a one owner
he likes one boy in the family and that's about it
just stays away or runs
usually but he follows he'll follow my oldest son around
you know when he's in the house he'll come up and he'll jump on his lap
but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are you doing
and
he he's we bought the cat for him and so he's been the one that you know spent the most time with him
but i i've never owned a cat like that i've had cats growing up all the time and you know they're usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody
a mutt
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
uh-huh
so that is that kind of your child right now
you feel like
oh uh-huh
have you had dogs before
uh-huh
yeah
and we had mostly well not mutts but mixes you know like one or one or two mix
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
no it's just
was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens and
we i would we
we had a dog that was a
mix between a an alaskan malamute and a labrador
when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was you know was a pet and it was a dog that we gotten
he was he was just too big the kids couldn't handle him and i was still going to school
and my wife was working and i was working and so we just didn't have time to really train him so he was kind of just you know he's too big for the kids to handle so he was just tied up to a post
so we gave him to i don't know if you've there's a place out here on it's called shorties lane out here in harrisville and they have
i guess it's kind of an animal shelter but he just takes a few of the animals in and some he destroys and some he keeps
so we took him up there and he ended up keeping him
because he's had him for six or seven years we we've
saw him just a oh i guess about a year ago and i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away and so we asked him about it one day and he said yeah he's been the best dog i've ever had in my life
just goes everywhere with him i he would've been a great dog
well i feel that for i feel there's a lot of shenanigans going on i feel there's a lot of crookedness in it but i do feel that for the most part
how about you
um-hum
uh-huh
right
oh uh-huh
uh-huh right i agree but the people are demanding that
that those that aren't you know that aren't either morally or politically or
going to do a good job that they're trying to get them out of it or at least they're taking a stand
against it so
i feel like they're all real good people that are trying their best to provide a service to the community and
when you think that most of the most of the politicians
i'm not really sure what the pay scales are and how that works but
that needs to be changed and they should have more accounting on the different ways that they
our little community and he ran you know for the town board and
and we felt like it was a real good experience i think that
you know when people are wanting to get involved to
to make changes for the better in the community that it's
that's it's a good thing so
really his reasons for doing that i don't
i don't know what he's
really
that's right yeah i was i'm interested in
our state is looking for a new governor and we have had oh i think the number is seven already that are running for it and this is not until next year that have put you know their hat in the ring to run and
and i was surprised by that because it had seemed to me like there was almost getting to be that it was hard to get people to run because of the reason that
you know they dredge up every single thing in your past
i mean and not very many people want to lay their whole life on the line like that and say hey i you know i've never made any mistakes and
i think that would be a little bit frightening to
to be put in the public eye like that myself but we've had it here in the state a lot of people that are going to run for
for governor and it seems like there's a lot of people that are starting to talk about running for president again
you know when bush is
when he's finished so
what do you think about the different you know the different formats the republican and democrat
do you think the parties are a good thing or do you think they need to be done away with or
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yes uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
right
it is
uh-huh and especially where if you don't completely agree with their platform if there's i mean there's not a lot of choice like you say and you have to have the financial support or there's just no hope and
i know that one of the
well i think i think basically we're in a lot of agreement in that i certainly agree that
for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs some kind of legal definition
but there should be with our
overworked
judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of
of
not having to take everything
before a
full court you know maybe there ought to be some kind of as an example where called a jury duty now
and maybe instead of
just kind of blowing it off and just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do
maybe we should commit to spend a week and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc let's hear about it group of i don't know twenty five instead of twelve
and each case is presented to that group of twenty five and those cases are of lesser degrees of magnitude
you know the guy was caught burgling and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor
and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guy's going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
i just think our system is overworked and we're starting to stress the true meaning of right to a speedy trial
you know we
you know kind of deltaing off what we've been talking about here i believe that
our we've become almost litigious society where we're everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff
and although we're supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that
you know maybe instead of being so quick to sue you if you have a disagreement with someone
instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you and if you want to your lawyer or your opponent
need to go face this group of twenty five or a judge wapner like you know that they have on tv and let
either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case and let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing
you bet and if
if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the
yes i'd forgotten what that's called there's a real name for that like the judean law or something like that
well that may be right it's in there some place i think we both know that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society
and too the that was sort of the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly
i guess the lord started out with we'll treat you i'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say
that's sort of the old testament version
i know i did a sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the old testament and the new testament where there's a vengeful lord in the old testament and there's a loving lord in the new testament but that's a whole different subject
okay well i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on the legal system
but it's been a pleasure talking with you
i'm living here in texas
well that's quite all right
my pleasure have a good day bye-bye
i like to play my guitar a lot and i do a little bit of wood working out in the garage a lot
not really very formal i took some classical guitar lessons from my church once but they weren't very good
and so i didn't really learn much from that i generally learn how to play songs just by ear i listen to it and figure it out myself and then go from there
yeah i was i was in several bands when i was
some what younger and then i just kind of got tired of it because they were all a little pig headed and
self centered didn't care about anybody else but themselves
yeah that too
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i don't have to you know it's cheaper to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store
so i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment it's an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself
it really depends on what you're making if you're making a piece of furniture yeah you'd generally need a good you know table saw and everything
if it's just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that
but
it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything
my dad's gotten into the to the wood working stuff here lately and he's trying to make a jewelry box for my grandmother for christmas and
he didn't get it finished because he kept screwing up the lid for it but
he doesn't know all the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or two and there's a couple of things he's done that i've like near had nearly had a heart attack over
it's like dad you're doing it wrong
you're gonna hurt yourself yeah but
yeah
and halloween and
yeah
yeah i work out of the i work at a renaissance festival down in waxahachie and
i have to make my own costume for that out there and
it tries your patience sometimes because the patterns aren't always the best things in the world they draw you a pattern on a on a piece of paper and you're supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and
kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it
yeah
yeah
one thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy
i took a couple classes in when i was in high school and stuff like that it's a lot of fun and it's fairly inexpensive you go out and get you two dollar pen that lasts forever and
yeah you can do it do your christmas cards and invitations and things like that
or even something you just wanna frame and stick on your wall
i live in richardson just outside of dallas it snowed
on the scale they gave one to ten i'd say i'm probably a four
i'm not totally i'm not
yeah
uh-huh
it really is the only problem i have with gun control is that they the radicals wanna ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gonna be the people who are gonna kill you anyway
yeah exactly right it really is because they're gonna get them one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so
and they're illegal so i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together
right
that's true
i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too how to take care of one how to act around one when they buy them
yep
oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the i've worked with a lot of people that hunt and they just they don't see any sense in it at all
they think it's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course they're hunters they know what they're doing they don't realize there're a bunch of crazy people out there that
yep that happens a lot too
but i guess that's it
oh
yeah because when people can't pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing and you know
oh definitely
right
yeah
yeah
yeah that sounds like a good idea my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government i don't know do we wind up with more red tape and more problems so yeah
um-hum
oh
yeah
wow yeah well i think part of the
tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money until you know they have no preventative measures because
people you know just go on and on and on i mean so many people don't even get prenatal care or and it just extends with if it what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous
um-hum
yeah
yeah
oh it's just unbelievable how much you go through when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar cat scan and i mean a chiropractor got it in one time it was just strange
oh well that should help
yeah
oh i see oh gosh
um-hum
right
sure
right i think i agree with that to a certain degree
certainly on an absolute scale it should be i think it should be funded more
on a relative scale looking at it in comparison with other
problems and no it's not a big environment
i'm not so sure about that however
yeah you're right definitely there's a definite stigma out there that yeah it's limited exclusive to intravenous drugs users and homosexuals and blacks or whatever
and that's not that's not the case anymore it may have started out that way even though there's still no proof of that
actually the most recent
the that i've gotten is they're starting to look at
well it started over in africa they're starting to look at
i believe
but believe it of monkey
yeah there was some kind of research going on
and i can't remember what the exact gist of it was but something they hadn't considered before and it's like they now they're trying to go way back to the original
but
um-hum
oh sure
yeah
yeah um-hum well i agree with that
the point i wanted to make was just strictly the environment like right now they say we've lost forty percent of the ozone layer just last year
in selected spots and that's really becoming a really big problem but that's not to down play the importance of aids research you know
when you think about that importance you also have to consider that
not only is aids good in and of it's own but it also has a lot to deal with
cancer and with mononucleosis and all the all the various diseases that affect the t cell from a and the and the when the white cells of the immune system because all fairly interrelated
so i think research on aids would benefit all that stuff
yeah
um-hum
you really don't see a lot out there
right you know that's for sure i like i said i go to school at ucf in florida
and actually that kind of hits home because that kimberly begajah that had aids
and died from it she went to a dentist in stewart florida that's where she got it
and stewart's like three hours away from where i go to school
more than that i had a couple of friends who went to that dentist
yeah and they were definitely sweating bullets there for a while and found out that they were negative you know they didn't have any problems but
you know boy talk about making you think twice before you go to the dentist
or any health care practitioner at this point
yeah because they really the last article i read on that they still hadn't figured out how she could've gotten it from him
because he as far as they could tell he sterilized the equipment he used gloves he did all the proper precautions
asides from telling his patients that he had aids
but still that didn't make any difference they still got it so they they're not real sure how that how that worked
but
yeah i'm a lot more cautious of that but
well what a what do we currently have i have a subaru g o x t
eighty eight
oh yeah it's not pretty old
so you think their quality control's going down over there kind of
but that's one reason i i've had no problems with my subaru that's one reason i went with it because i subaru had a good reputation for you know low maintenance so
and those things just keep ticking i mean they just it can rack up a hundred fifty k on them and they're still beating on them
yeah
yeah
oh well
anyway so what's your next purchase supposed to be
oh really if you had a choice of your car what would you get
i'm not sure i'm real familiar with the body style on that
uh-huh that's
um-hum
yeah
yeah
oh okay yeah
do you have do you have a family okay well that's probably influenced maybe a little bit
oh yeah
yeah well when i bought my car it was right out of college and you know i always been looking for something sporty and i ended up getting you know basically something that i could
you know afford
the only gripe i have
is performance i probably a few girls that i've gone out with i've had like mazda rx seven's and stuff and they're pretty fun to drive so
so i think that's what i i'm going to have to get next time around i keep i keep holding off i mean i could i could upgrade now if i wanted to but i just i it's just such a huge expense and
and i i'm just going to keep holding off but i'm definitely going to look for something in the you know nice you know yeah
hello okay
wonder what happened
hum anyway
but i'll probably
it just depends i know that's what i want but i don't know if i'll get myself to
spend that kind of money you're looking at you know for a new rx seven or a supra or something you're looking at twenty five k or something like that so
anyway but
yeah
hello okay
it may be my phone anyway it's the only car that says you know sporty and class so
kind of what i'm but it's at the other one my brother's got a miata and those are fun
and
and he actually they came out with a european racing green
miata that's a limited edition they're only going to make like three or four thousand so he went out and he traded the other one in and got this one and i'm like
but i haven't seen one yet either but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel so it's very authentic and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be may be a good investment
if it
yeah
uh-huh but i think
okay yeah i got off my pace or my cordless phone anyway hope it's not going bad it's going to bum me out but he i think he only spent you know the low twenties so
i don't know
well i don't know i think the demands gone down a little bit i think you can the prices aren't as high you know and the miata was first introduced
yeah the demand is so high that you know they were going to retail them around like third you know
thirteen standard you know and you get your options you're looking at fifteen or fifteen but there were you know people were buying them for nineteen and twenty
and
they may have gone down a little bit but i they're still pretty much in demand
i think there's another car coming in it's supposed to come out and compete with that miata and i can't remember what i read about that but so that's interesting i mean i would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular so
but
oh yeah and the mitsubishi three thousand gt is the same
yeah well that's the same manufacturer and so they just market them but yeah those are and those are supposed to be
very performance power i mean they're there is yeah big time
yeah
i think they're only around twenty nine k
yeah
yeah i'm being
single and no other responsibilities for yourself i guess you know it's i can i can i've been pretty happy i've haven't tried to upgrade myself right now that's
you know i could i could have you know get something nice and upgrade but i just i'm consulting right now so
i just made my first job hop about eight months ago so
local politics yeah
well also too often too the individual congressman has the especially if they are on some of the committees that put these budgets together
have the opportunity to slide things in that normally should not have gone in at all and the yeah and the line item veto would be ideal for that i mean to
yeah
yeah
yeah
there's another way where the budget could probably benefit and this has to do of course it has to do with federal projects
too often those are not there's no accountability once the projects are awarded to make sure that the quality is done and they end up getting stuck with
billions of dollars of overlay
or if contracts are put out no one is responsible or it does not seem to be
for following up that if it goes over budget it well you know it's set up laissez faire attitude well that's to be expected we just sort of built it in well that shouldn't happen that way
and i think i think if there was more attention paid to what's being spent and more accountability that would help enormously too are
how who or how that would come about i'm not sure but that's an area that i think needs to be looked at
well i think there could be a lot of consolidation of programs
area that has taken a lot of shots recently but i do not see the point of having four different services
i do not see why they could not have one military service
that's right because a lot of the monies are spent with insiding within those departments
basically i'm in i'm in agreement with that
i would think that there probably needs to be a monitor or not a monitor
or courtesy you know yeah a presence but not a
no well witness the recent gulf war too even with troops all over europe it took several months to gear up
and so what was the point of having them to begin with
well i didn't buy one i just changed jobs and got a work car or a company car and they bought me a pontiac grand prix and
i've been yeah i've been pretty happy with it i i've been driving just a little honda the honda civic and stuff and so it's a bigger car but i've been pretty pleased with it you know i
it was it's you know got a lot of nice gadgets and stuff but i it's been nice so far i can't say that it's put it through all the loops
yeah i can use it for personal and
no not really i although we my other we have a second car and it's getting a little bit old it's an eighty five honda civic and so we're thinking in a year or two we might have to but
you know i kind of i just like to keep up i you know don't plan on buying one like i say for a year or two but sooner or later i'm going to have to
but
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i bet
now is that a is that a full size van or
minivan
oh was it
you do so do you shop the consumer reports when you buy a car then or do you
do you find that works out pretty good for you
uh-huh
did you
uh-huh
well that's good to hear yeah that's good to hear some good news about some american made cars i
i really believe they're getting better and you know i looked around and seen some of those new saturns and stuff and they seem to be a really nice car
and
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that's true
um-hum
oh yeah what we found just even going down to our inlaws overnight this little honda civic there's just not enough room we i've just got one daughter by the time you put the car seat and a couple of bags i mean we're just
you know we were having that problem that why there's just not enough room those small cars any more you know we couldn't go camping because we couldn't put a tent and a cooler in it you know it was so small
but
oh really
oh really
yeah
yeah
they've had that for a while yeah
well it says something they're willing at least put something behind it you know they're they feel like turning out a good product and they're at least
yeah that warranty stuff that's i did have to take this company car in and the cassette jammed all of a sudden
and it was nice to know that you know that it was still under its warranty and they just took it and took care of it right on the spot but that's definitely something i think i'd shop for i'd want as much warranty as i could because
it's expensive to get the things fixed anymore
if it's not covered
to buy it
yeah
uh-huh
no they don't you know they
yeah if you get something that's one or two years old you can usually knock i worked at a bank as a loan officer and so i could you know i got into that a little bit you know the dealership financing and stuff but
you know at two years makes a huge difference you know they say and it's pretty much true that you drive off the lot and you lose at least a thousand dollars as soon as you take that thing off the lot in value and the hondas and some of those they don't depreciate as much but you can still get them a little bit cheaper
but i tell you it's kind of scary we bought our company car through an auction a dealer auction and the dealers they get those things for about half of what they sell them
couldn't believe it i we stickered the car i got this grand prix was stickered at sixteen thousand it was a ninety one and had ten thousand miles on it but we ended up getting it for about ten
i tell you i i've been real happy with the hondas actually we had a have a nineteen eighty honda accord too
not a terrific amount to be honest with you
i really don't have much in the way of tools i'd like to get a router and some other things like that but i really don't have much how about yourself
uh-huh
uh-huh
you know i've made a just some simple things here just some shelves and
but you do need the tools i don't have much in the way of tools to be honest i don't have a table saw or a drill press or any of that kind of stuff
no i've got a drill and i think i got a jig saw and i got a circular saw but
oh
uh-huh
yeah
pardon me
yeah they're solid core and they made a real terrific table top for a for a work bench there
so you know it's real steady and
is it the new yankee oh no it's this other guy it's called the new yankee workshop i don't know if you've ever seen him or not
new yankee
i think that's what it's called but he makes mostly furniture items you know he'll make a mirror or a chest of drawers or a table
and it's fascinating to watch him work you know he does a terrific job but he's got every single thing you can imagine you know
yeah he's got all the all those things you'd like and
and
that's the problem i watch him do those things and i say you know i probably could do that given a little bit of experience yeah
if i had five or ten thousand dollars in equipment like i'm sure he has
yeah
yeah
so
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
oh
is that right
well i've been tempted once in a while to i don't know you have these community education programs
where you're adult education you can you can take a class in the evenings where you go at the local high school or the community college and sign up for a wood working class i've been tempted to do that
i have some a friend that made a microwave stand and some you know some other kinds of things like that did a nice job and then you know then you can use their stuff
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
it'd be
yeah
well we
we try
it's not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and where they were all going and i have a budget book that i use
if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier
but and then at the end of the year i totaled up what we were spending say for groceries or entertainment or things like that and then this year i tried to keep it within
you know a bounds there and then if there's if we are over budget in one item if we want to apply that to another one i try to do that but it's not always
easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month things like that you're not expecting
i don't really know how some people stay within a budget
do you have kids
one we don't have any because i thought if well if we had a child i don't know what we'd do
but my husband gets paid once a week and i get paid every two weeks
and then every three months i have a bonus check and but then that's when we try to put some a side at that time
as far as savings i take out of each pay check i put so much into a four o one k pan in a profit sharing
and then he does the same thing he puts one into a stock plan at his company and also into a retirement plan
because to me that's the only way we're ever going to be able to save
because if the money comes in it's spent if it's not taken out before i get it
oh yeah
that's very hard
um-hum
yeah they say how old is he
he's five they say by the time
kids his age are ready to go to college it's gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college
and it's just unbelievable
you know i i'm just twenty nine and when i went it was probably five hundred dollars a semester for the tuition books and everything
um-hum where is she going
yeah
i'm sure it is
oh yeah is she started having do the working at the hospitals
has she started doing any of work at the hospitals
yeah because i i've got a friend that just graduated and took her test to be an r n and i think towards the last year they were working at the hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and
but it is hard i don't know in compared to say my mother and father
living in a budget was no problem
it was just this is what we have and this is what we spend but that's in this time and you know i don't know what it is it's well it's
you know my husband let's go play some golf you know something like that or let let's run to the mall with me and you know
parent's didn't do that if they didn't have the money they didn't get it and we're not that way
um-hum
um-hum
and it's hard
credit card rates are still
sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen percent
okay
that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think they're mismanaged and i think that sometimes it's too easy of a
i don't know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say i'll tax them if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or you know get all of the waste out of the spending
i don't know what y'all are paying in dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a
the taxes is set by you know the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from california
and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation
yeah
yeah ours is seven point seven five almost eight and it drives me crazy i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about
we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it
so
that's true and i did pay state tax in california but my goodness that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay
know you don't sound like you're from dallas where do you do you come from originally texas or
oh okay
you just you just managed to escape the real texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
yeah
that's right
yeah
and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said well you know you render unto caesar's what is caesar's you render unto god what is god's and
but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to
you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i don't want to pay more than i have to and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that they're necessary you know so i really do
where do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or
schedule a well yeah and you know
yeah
and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and it's the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
uh-huh
that's right
that's right my parents bought a home in san diego about four or five years ago
and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other wednesday and that's exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that
just because exactly what you said you're making one more months payment every year
yeah so that's
that's a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner
yeah
yeah
well that's good though
yeah
well that's good though is it kind of a buyers market down there you'll be
well that's good
that's pretty excellent
that's good
well i can't either i appreciate the call though
i enjoyed talking to you
in lubbock
what was her name
no i didn't know any walker's
well good luck in your house hunting
i do yeah i'm in human resources yeah
do you really see that okay i worked with elma
yeah and i used to work i did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years
you are
what are you trying to get
oh
okay so you work in back grind
oh okay
that's what you do huh and demos four
well good deal what do y'all think of sam
well that's good
he was very good for lubbock when he came to he you know it was the same kind of thing he had a lot of good results
good
well good
good
oh okay
well that's good
well you too and
well on a scale of one to ten being ten no kind of legislation and zero being total ban i probably would lean more towards six or seven
i feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals
i lived in massachusetts for two years and they have a total ban on guns and i saw that it didn't stop crime in that state
any kind of firearms
yeah it's there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught with a firearm and also i think there was a fine
no i don't the crime is not any better or any worse i mean it's
i shouldn't say i don't know if it was any worse but it certainly didn't get any better
uh-huh
yeah i agree with that i think that the law is on who can buy a gun are way too lax i think that i think that the
yeah
i
yeah i i'm not really sure i don't personally i don't own a gun and i don't think i probably ever would
although i would like to know how to handle one and i think it's good that and i think everybody should learn how to handle one
you just never know when you might come into contact with one
no nobody in my family hunted
my father had guns when i was in high school because
we lived in new hampshire at the time
and he moved to massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns so we ended up with these guns and my really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right
and so that was really the only experience that i've had with guns and it kind of scared me
but i think that if i learn how to use one
i would i would feel better
yeah
yeah that's true
um-hum
i would definitely support that
yeah i agree the thing that scares me though about where i would i would definitely want some sort of legislation and
coming from the north east i'm just not used to seeing these and i know this may sound kind of stereo typical but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks
you know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in l a on the freeways and then you come here in the dallas area
i don't i don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles
especially not
for everybody to see
sure you're welcome okay bye-bye
yes i have that room i showed you and then since then we painted the bedroom
yeah i showed you that one too didn't i the brown one yeah the one that looks like a fudgesicle
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
well i've heard now i asked janice somebody recently about how you do that
oh when you paint the ceiling if you know when you got that textured stuff that they'd have special rollers
that are real soft and furry that you'd paint that with how you get the edge you just have to be real careful
we use a two inch brush with on a slant
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes
but
well yeah i think i'm going to do it this spring actually
there're six houses see the people that own the house they pay for anything like that we do as far as the materials there's three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses
so i'm thinking i'm gonna change it to something you know the brick is multicolor with mostly earth tones i think i'm gonna put something like a brown on it
on the outside yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something where it'll stand out a little
what color'd you paint
yeah
there's some columns that could be painted a different color too what color did you paint your house
on the
well you got to get one of those ladders
yeah
yeah i know our house in new mexico it was stucco but we had all this trim to paint and a lots of it
and we did basically seventy five percent of the house and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff
so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid and he came with his own what do you call those things no those where you built like a rafter thing
yeah
scaffolds yeah he came and did it that way and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up
yeah plus he cleaned up my mess
yeah
how much did it cost you to for the paint for the outside
yeah
yeah that
yeah
and anyway he when he checked out they and he was using his furrows charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something
and he had he had the he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint
so she had to start all over again and he when he got outside he noticed his receipt was for like thirteen ninety nine or something
yeah
yeah rollers are so messy we never mess with them anymore
well still a paintbrush
yeah we have a
two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and finding what we consider to be real good child care at a
pretty reasonable price we think
how about you do you have any children
oh boy
yeah
are you where are you student
no kidding
i was a professor in a university here in california for a while
yeah are you gonna put your son in child care in a year or two
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
any other important decision you really have to explore the alternatives and what we found
facility she goes to a home this is a
a couple emigrated from china early in their lives they've been here probably thirty forty years they've got three daughters
and they have a loving home and they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon
and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends so it's a good experience i if it's good i think it's very good for the child
and if it's a loving environment i think it's very good and that's really what we've learned about it she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of a preschool in a year
but we feel real fortunate and we were able to
just
choose in the marketplace i don't know what it's like around hattiesburg
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i'll bet they're involved
yeah
yeah well that's i know it's a real hard thing to do even for people in university communities out here at stanford they have a
you know a real good facility and there is quite a waiting list to get into that so it's
you know it's a it's a it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry and i think that it really is buyer beware
well it is the best way to do it interestingly i think that my own interest in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that
private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn because i think what we're gonna go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market as a matter of fact my future is banked on that
professionally because i believe that there are
pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for
learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life
it's phenomenal it's phenomenal the programming
the human operating system is my
okay
hi
yeah sure i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back
if you can't pay for it you shouldn't have it period
and
that's just
um-hum
well
right but that's the problem see as our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that
yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own
or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt
then the next generation like if our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight
if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us
that the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford
which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds
but i feel like the generation after us oh man it i would be so good
it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy
and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer
uh-huh
but see i we made poor choices in college we took out two both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans
and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it
i didn't need it i shouldn't have even qualified to get it i didn't need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it
and as i look back now we're paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans
don't do it and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that but i just
so like we might if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because god's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know
but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy
including new vans and so
so i guess i've seen it done and i know you can do it you know
but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van
and that's where americans don't like to do it and so and we don't want to cut back our services from the government because we're spoiled
what
yeah
i know
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah that is true
but isn't that federal in the federal budget
but isn't it part of our it's not part of our taxes
it's not
that's why it keeps going up huh that's another topic
those stamps are valuable now
that's funny yeah and that is a good short term thing though that little things like that
that overall though i just think we're just going to i don't know see i know i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because
i know that bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to
be a potential power problem later with who's going to be in charge with this new world order
and so i know that the long-term vision for the us government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh
but i'm concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know
that's a lot of power for one or two people to have
and so i guess because i guess i feel like i know what their long-term vision is i'm kind of like
you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles and i don't think americans are willing to do it
i don't i don't feel we should loan them money if i wish our leaders were really seeking the lord on these things
and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine but i don't feel we should be loaning money like that i mean it doesn't work are they gonna
but it's not but it's not set up as a giveaway if it were set up as a giveaway and it was something that
i mean our president and our leaders could be seeking god saying god is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them
and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that god would bless our nation but because we're our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires i mean none of these nations have paid us back
it be do you understand it's i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving you give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but
because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be no taxes on our things
our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back but because we're loaning it i think that's the problem and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks
use a lot of discernment don't give money to every nation
you know what i'm saying i think we're loaning money to too many nations
but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them
and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think we're never going to get that back you know
do you understand
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
right long term though do you think it would be best to see an a one world you know you can't alleviate all national debts or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking god on how to turn our nation around financially
that's my opinion my opinion's the latter
um-hum
i know but what's yours do you agree or do you disagree or i mean what do you think long term
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah different
yeah i know what you're saying
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it was good to remember the that kind of asian philosophy
that
oh
or out of the country or join special forces either one
yeah just a second
you restrict access cause a lot of times people are trying to cut them out okay
no not really
a lot of things that aren't being addressed
isn't that something
um-hum
okay
hey mark i've got to go we'll see you i guess our five minutes are up according to me are they to you
yeah okay bye-bye
so
does your company do any sort of drug testing
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
so what are they worried about are they worried about
i mean do you is this a secure environment you're in
uh-huh
yeah and not to mention the legal ones which they don't even care about
um-hum
uh-huh
right and you'll be penalized
i mean you could lose your job very easily
no
okay
right
i guess so right
oh yes his life is over at that point
yeah i've read things that talk about the number of false or negatives
to the number of false positives and you know the number of people you're going to hurt
while accomplishing you know whatever you think you're accomplishing is really quite high
uh-huh
it is the only thing is i my what i think is they they're testing for
you know especially illegal drugs is part of the real problem the real problem is you want to make sure this guy is on the ball
and i think that what they should be doing is performance testing
not drug testing you know they should have some sort of video game or something
that the guy has to play or you know something like that because if he you know maybe he didn't get any sleep the night before
and just stayed up too late and for that reason is not on the ball or he's
you know he he's unhappy about something or he's sick
or
you know using some legal drug that they don't test for i mean i really don't want to be i don't want to die in a train wreck
and it's because i don't want to die that i want them to do a more meaningful test
well i can see there be yeah i mean i actually it's some mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if you're going to do testing do a meaningful test like a performance test
the testing itself i could see where the testing if it's not if it is a performance test i mean it's directly related doing your job
it has nothing to do with your personal you know lifestyle
um-hum
well a lot of people say that would
simplify a lot of things i tend to
i tend to agree just because the attempts to make certain things illegal were such flops
i liked it i really did actually i saw it twice my ex-roommate and i were
real into psychological things we think people with mind problems are really interesting so
i mean you know real psychotic people so we were dying to see it so we went and saw it and i had to see it the second time to get it all because i kept my eyes closed through so much of the first part
well it's not that it's that scary it's that it's so graphic
okay well it's what is so weird about it is that it it's a real it's based on real people
and i read the story in people magazine about where they got the characters in the movie and they're a combination of a lot of different serial killers in real life
and so a lot of things that happen in the movie the only thing really scary about it is that it could happen to you
it really does happen in real life you know normally in movies you can look at it and say well it's a movie
right
right but in this you're going i would have done that i can see where that would happen
and it's it gets really scary but it's a real interesting movie very thought provoking there are so many things to discuss when the movie's over
if you're one of those people that likes to discuss things and think about why it happened
yeah
i didn't think i'd like it i don't normally like the old west type movies things like that the
they don't normally interest me but that one i really liked because it i didn't know so much about the indians and all that
that happened in that part of the war
i had never heard anything really about that before and this was a whole new idea to me anyway i thought it was real good
i'm about a quarter italian and my grandmother on my mother's side is a little bit of everything
typical american little bit of indian little bit of this little bit of that
and that's about it
what
do you
oh really
which
which were they sioux indians or what were they
oh neat
right
right
uh-huh
that was awesome
oh i did too i did too
yeah
um-hum
it makes you realize how really ignorant some white people are people who have no ethnic background no heritage anything other than just typical americans a little bit of everything and they don't really know
they don't know anything about the indian people they don't know anything about the europeans that came over
you know it really made it seem like we are so in the dark on so many things
right exactly
uh-huh
and i still really other than just basic ignorance of prejudice i don't understand why we didn't
why them why did we not listen to them
i've never
well yeah but isn't it sad to think that greed can do that much to you or to a person
i mean they we wanted the land and we didn't want them to have it so just screw everything they're going to think and teach us and tell us and we could just like wipe out an entire
people like that
that's sad
right
uh-huh
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
right that is that's a good way to look at it a consolation prize that's about all it was
that's really sad that things like that can still happen today after all this time
yeah that's true
that's right who's got more hotel
i liked dances with wolves but it was a an emotional like you get real involved and you cried and you feel real sorry for the people you know and all this but in silence of the lambs it was kind of that fatal attraction did you see that
it was kind of that feeling through the whole thing on the edge of your seat wanting to tell the people what to do next
no believe it or not the whole theatre got involved i mean yes in fact i'm trying to i can't remember which scene it was but at one point everyone in the theatre clapped
they were so happy it was it and i thought i was just there and i heard other people crying when i was crying
there were certain parts in there that were real sad and you hear people when you know the actors are doing things that you know are about to reap some bad thing and
it i think everybody felt that way through it was real involved
and all the girls were crying when they walked out and all the guys were just kind of staring straight ahead like that didn't bother me and you know it did
right i remember the first time i saw it was with my boyfriend
and he was joking with me about how i wasn't going to watch half of it i was going to close my eyes
and there were quite a few scenes where i did but this one scene i knew something bad was coming i could tell so i ducked my head
he literally jumped and he swears he didn't do it and i felt him jump
and
it really was to this day i tell him he was scared and he says no you just didn't watch it you should have watched it wasn't that bad
i'm like yeah right that's why you jumped
yeah really it is a great movie you got to see it
it's so fascinating to think that there are people that are so
so smart they're such geniuses that they've cross that line and they're psychotic and it's amazing
it really is i mean to think that it could be anybody we know i mean you could be
walking right next to one of them and not even know it because they look perfectly normal i mean this man was a doctor
and he had patients in fact they were the people he killed you know and you think right now your doctor could be wacko
he could be some psychotic killer and no one would ever know
it's just strange but that was what was that was what made the movie because it's so real
i like movies that are based on things that are real
oh what was that
in the way that it's applied or that it's applied at all
so i how do you feel that it should be applied
and that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced
yes
that's i agree with that completely i know we don't have enough prisons but there has got to be some kind of punishment for these people
because if they turn around they can get away they get away with it and they get away with it and they get away with it and then they do something worse and they get a slap on the wrist they get thirty days in jail and they finally get up to where they kill somebody else and they go through fourteen appeals and
how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars
and it's
well they certainly are living off our at our expense
i didn't
yes
um-hum
and be paroled and have served the sentence that's what that's what people face with that choice one thing i really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a in a trial on a capital murder trial or in
cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to
you know they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know that should be life but instead in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something
and then turn around in thirty years that you know and less they're out
even if they're even in that long or they appeal and then they get an appeal that says it was you know an unjust amount of time it was an extraordinary long length or something
yeah
i'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent i think people know that nobody that it doesn't
you know it's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective
and i mean it sounds horrible it i hear myself saying this and
but i don't know what else to do with some of these people that are because they let them back out again and they do the same thing over and over again then they put them back in jail and they get out and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system
and it's like i said at our expense
yes
i know i you read about it in the paper every day somebody who's done this or that
something
really horrible and they just get away with it and nothing happens
yeah
i think i think texas is texas the southern states seem to be
somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty and i think i know california had it for a long time and then they took it off the books they repealed it
and people like charles manson and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison
and are now that even though california has reinstated the death penalty
for whatever various crimes the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and are now coming up for parole some of them like manson who's come up
you know it's been denied fortunately but
yeah well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death
and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of california reverked revoked the law in the early seventies and then they reinstated it later but the penalty didn't go back you know
it seems like a lot of times the law is totally on the criminal side and isn't protecting the rest of the people
um-hum
yeah
and then he gets up for this one trial and they don't find anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
and so they say well this is you know i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal
yeah well
to some extent if they would do something with some of those people but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too
they plead insanity and then three years later they're cured and let loose on society again
i mean it's a it's a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out i know in the dallas metroplex area i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself
and i certainly i grew up in a smaller town in texas and it wasn't that way when i was younger
we could go around and boy
yes ever you can't even
when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard that i can't see them
well good talking to you too bye
uh-huh
and i think there is a lot of problems in that area a i think there is problems all over the education system whether it be
of
type of kids you know because it's starting to become new and they're starting to find out more research about this type of learning
and so
uh-huh
that's right
that's right it they're they hire teachers who aren't even qualified to teach those kind of kids and they burn out so fast they don't wanna teach them
uh-huh
right
problems you know learning that and comprehending well what does that mean i think it's i think more teachers should
find different ways and be creative on their teaching
so
yeah exactly
the grading system
well
i think well in a sense it's probably too easy but if it wasn't
these kids you know i mean nowadays a lot of kids they just you know don't try they don't get the grades that they could
and
i don't
yeah i think
well the field i wanna go into grades to me doesn't mean much it doesn't tell you how intelligent you are how bright you are you know
because i know somebody who's very bright and very intelligent but just doesn't get the grades and that's just because they have a learning disability so yeah i think you have a good point there where they don't focus enough on them
right
um-hum yeah
quite a few
we've said that our
our magazine subscriptions really add up to a strange bunch but i get i get business week i get one called dulcimer player's news i get
the washington post weekly magazine
we get time and then i get well i guess i don't get any electronics magazines anymore i get electronics
news newspaper
what about you
hm
well
yeah
yeah that little bit of the of the whys behind what's happening and not just the facts yeah i
yeah
yeah
well i know that yeah and the category that i forgot is the
professional ones i'm a member of i triple e and
acm association for community materials i get three or four the magazine form things that way too so
i don't know what the what the status is in general of people reading magazines i certainly do a lot of it and newspapers for that matter but i
i've heard that the trend in reading in general and in especially newspapers is down that people just
yeah i think i think so i don't i haven't heard exactly how it's effecting the magazines maybe not quite as much but i think that the
more and more people are just depending on the tv for what news they do get and
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
yeah i wonder if i wonder if that will make things different i've heard that
read an article just last week about fax newspapers coming out and wonder if they'll do that with you know magazine kinds of things as well i was it
skip bayless
no but it was interesting
kind of
and it they for a long time they've been talking about that you know that
moving away from paper magazines i guess would it be included in that in terms of computer access and stuff but that
doesn't really seem to have caught on to the extent that they keep predicting
yeah
i think you're right there it might be a little more ruthless to go with the free enterprise system the government has a sort of a habit of investing in things that don't pay much return
and getting into projects that there is no yield on the investment so it's all money down the rat hole
um-hum
no i'm sort of in fairfax county working for one of the free loaders on the government contract group
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
well i think my father went through his life saying that he just keeps paying taxes and paying taxes and paying taxes
and he never got anything out of the government for it
yeah
well the welfare is a good example that
you know if welfare is handled at the local level by small groups like the churches and some of the organized charities that get people involved directly
then the money gets right straight to the people and there's a lot of volunteer work and supporting that type of operation
but you let the government handle it and next thing you know you're spending four out of five dollars just to administer it
and it just seems like nothing gets down to the people
huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah well i'm afraid they may have a more bureaucratic system than we do
i think one of my biggest concern on taxes is real estate taxes down at the local level the federal government seems to be pretty stable you know you can figure out what they're gonna charge you next year
but since i moved into this house five years ago the real estate tax has doubled
and i'm just afraid that by the time i'm ready to retire and the mortgage is paid off on this house i won't be able to afford the taxes on it
yeah well that was true on the last house i bought i got a thirty year mortgage on it and by the time i sold it the tax payment was a bigger part of the
and i figure it just says that when i'm ready to retire i'm gonna have to move out of fairfax county and get out in the country some place
and there's no control over it the accessors just come around and say okay you're assessment just went up twenty thirty percent and
you know there's no recourse
well the property taxes are supposed to pay for education and some of the county services
and i hope that some of that is working efficiently we have a pretty good school system
i'm a little concerned that there's too much paper work there for them
well one of the things that
that i found to be an invasion is when i pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the
on the credit card bill
that is something that is not required and in fact
one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic research and to get the your phone number on
lists for phone solicitations
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
right that
i agree with you there that's something that people have seen oh here's an easy way to make some money
fairly recently
some talk about that in this in my state ah the budget problems up here are pretty tense and people are looking for
alternate ways of you know enhancing revenue is the phrase they use and they were talking about selling the dmv lists and there was a lot of
a lot of
consternation about that and the last i heard they'd backed down from that idea
but
it really makes you wonder what other lists you're on that have been made public that you don't know about
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hm
right
um-hum
right
um-hum
last year the lotus development company the company that puts out one two three was planning on marketing a cd-rom
with peoples names sorted by
number of different criteria
all right there we go
so what's your prediction on north carolina and duke
i mean my gosh look who kansas beat to get to meet north carolina i mean they beat arkansas
and they beat and they beat they beat indiana they creamed indiana
well i thought so too they just had a letdown in the second half and they couldn't recover
well they say unlv may be the greatest amateur team ever
yeah big time i i'll bet they could hold their own in the nba
seriously
i bet there're some teams they could beat
possibly
yeah actually i'm kind of a lakers fan myself
oh yeah him and worthy and
yeah he's good coming off the bench now of course the they got sam perkins
and that helps
oh okay well you remember sam perkins when he was in north carolina don't you
see he was a teammate with james worthy and michael jordan
yeah in fact jordan hit the winning basket to win by one point
with like sixteen seconds to go
they gave him the ball he took the shot if he makes it he's a hero if he misses it he's a goat he made it
yep
well i really don't think anybody can beat unlv they might beat themselves but i don't know they're at such a high level of intensity
they would have to have a really off day and somebody else would have to have a really on day and if that if both of those happened at the same time
you might have an upset
well unlv's kind of in a different league from everybody else it it's kind of similar to back when ucla was winning seven titles in a row from sixty seven to seventy three back then they called the
and they used to call it the ucla invitational
because they figured everybody else is just coming to just to be there
yeah i don't know that any one team's gonna be able to dominate for that many years in a row
partly because the really many of the really outstanding players leave college before they turn seniors
so you don't yeah so you don't really get to keep the nucleus of your best talent for the whole four years
well this has been fun i've enjoyed talking with you
god bless and you have a good day now bye-bye
oh boy well i haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately i read one book a friend recommended to me i can't even remember the guy's name it was a science fiction dean
mostly i read i'm a marriage and family counselor and mostly i read things to do with raising kids and now i have two little kids or codependency or you know fifty thousand things like john bradshaw's books on the family and
homecoming and inner child and so i read usually that kind of stuff if and right now i'm reading judith viorst's book called necessary losses where she talks about different losses that we've had in our lives that we have to get past if we're going to mature and
you know but gosh it's getting pathetic now if i get through a magazine i've been
you do oh how interesting what kind of books
oh my goodness
yeah well that sounds like a fascinating job
yeah
yeah
kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the social no
hum that sounds so familiar
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh that sounds interesting yeah
oh
i thought that was going to be some
oh
oh my goodness
huh
um-hum nursing or
yeah secretaries i bet that used to be mostly men who were secretaries of any type for business
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah like the scribes who did the old documents you know for churches and
and yeah that's interesting
um-hum
hum
gosh really
so are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts that have not been
huh
yeah
my goodness well that's fascinating gosh
um-hum yeah i never have gotten into any of the romantic novels or any of that kind of stuff my husband reads a lot of the well he did before we had kids the star trek and all those kind of sci-fi kinds of things you know
you he's got a quite a collection of those but
my stuff revolves around one let's see i've got one called one thousands practical parenting tips which teaches you to put elastic instead of shoelaces in your kid's shoes hey i've done that to every pair my three year old has
you know really and
since i'm a therapist and all i've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups so i've got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue the blue book the big book
and all the oa literature and all the coda literature so i'm trying to get more familiarized with that because i refer clients and different groups and
well let's see i'm trying to think of the
oh i have a love affair with john bradshaw i just have found everything i've read of his to be fabulous
he started out with one called the family which does the family systems and people's roles in the family and then he did healing the shame that binds you
about how shame can just be so paralyzing and people isolate and withdraw and then the third one that he came out with is now called homecoming and there's a subtitle to it i never can remember what it is it's something like a journey
in your inner child or something like that
oh he's just great and now he's had the first the first one and the third one put into a ten session pbs series
yeah
oh
that's in arizona who used to be in dallas it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in texas called pm melody who does a lot of writing on codependency and she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and
a workbook called breaking free and just some real helpful practical things for codependency so that's been another one that i've thought was real helpful but
but i really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more new things out that you know i i'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids but there's such cute things out for kids
oh i know and i just go to the library because i just they're expensive i mean it and they go through them so fast you know
so i just i really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out and they just love to sit and read and now finally the littlest one is old enough to sit you know and watch the pictures instead of grabbing it and trying to rip the pages out
so that has been fun to do that you know go through the children's literature and
uh-huh
oh wonderful
gosh really well i'm going to have to look for those yeah
oh
yeah
yeah
does your family normally have a reunion do you have one that's been
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um-hum
uh-huh
well it might be a good time for you to start a tradition you could be responsible for that yourself
sure
well in my family
let's see last october was the forty fifth annual reunion the first sunday in october the jordan family gets together
and all of the descendants of the civil war i mean yeah the civil war veteran come together and they come as far away as from california and there's usually
oh between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people
in there's a big community hall in vernon
texas and that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the texas family
uh-huh
right uh-huh a lot of the older family lives in vernon all of his direct descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties
so we're talking about second and third great grand children here
i take my boys
well i took them up till this year they're grown and gone from home now so they take their family but
let's see that would make them grandfather great grandfather great grandfather okay so it would be the second great grandchild
it's
well it's a community center it's a community hall it's a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen in it
and you just bring the covered dishes every family brings a dish of some kind and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been handed down for years
well we try to stay away from those things which might have salmonella in them
and we choose to bring congealed salad you can bring a congealed vegetable salad as opposed to potato salad and we are very conscious of most of us are very conscious of
sanitation aspects whatever you've got to carry for any distance i always take home baked bread
that happens to be my specialty for that family i do other things very well but there are others in the family who do them better
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
well it's we have kind of a core group that serves as quote officers of the organization and they plan the reunions they
organize the you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who's going to rent the tables who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer and each year it's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles
we have a biographer who continues every year to save clippings on any family member and they're entered into a wonderful scrap book
and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and obituaries to those who are gone and it keeps the family alive even you know even though it's very fluid and they're very dedicated to that
and it's been really wonderful it helps you hang on to your roots
and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family his family was very scattered and very diverse
and i asked him i got to talking to him i said well how is his nephew doing well i don't know i haven't talked to my brother in three years i said well how's your brother doing i don't know
you know my son keeps in touch with him i think but i don't i said hey wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people yeah but i'm you know it's too much trouble
so i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one
to our place down at lake tawakoni liked to kill me because i it was i didn't have that group cooperation i did it by myself
it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping and we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and i told him
we did it that year and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there we sent invitations we said please let us know if you're coming it was when his mother his
step father had died the year before and it his mother was alone and so they came to support her and then one by one his you know his sisters he began to lose family members
and it was difficult to hold them together and then of course he died two years ago so
you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now
and it i think that's what happens when they get scattered the family unit
you know falls into disrepair
um-hum
uh-hum
um-hum
uh-huh well see we manage those people who are at that core group manage to keep the vigor alive they'll send out news bulletins two or three times a year you'll get a news hey guess who got
you know elected to the legislature or guess who's our local sheriff
that's true
and you get sequestered or something then you're there for months
when you get sequestered and you're there for months
true
yeah
yeah right
well as you say the
benefits are the biggest part of it i think that today with costs for medical insurance and eyeglasses and dental and all that
it is a plus to have that as far as your salary goes you know along with it
because it's not out of pocket money and it they also have good life insurance policies good retirement dakota the jet funds all that stuff i think you know the ira's
the profit sharing the stock options
there are a they offer a lot of ways for you to save money too if you have any extra you know that like the code over the two for one type of thing or they match half i guess it is
and
i think that a lot of it's the personal recognition that the company gives people if they do a good job
the incentive you know to want to do a good job
and the
mir awards banquets and things i think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people
and they're meetings
to keep you full informed
you don't find that much in small companies because you can kind of interface but when you get a big company like ours i think it's great that they take the time to you know give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's going on
that type of thing
we interface kind of like on the tip teams and things i think that's a good deal
it gives you a chance to feel like you're a part of a group or the organization and that you're heard
and know and if you have ideas that type of thing
do you have a mandatory
do you have a mandatory shut down
oh that's why see you can you're able to do that but we haven't got much choice
that's the if i had to say one thing negative that would be it because i feel like you know you earn your vacation time and you should be able to take it when you want to
but we're not allowed to we have to take two weeks when the company shuts down you know
and i can understand it from there point of view in on the one hand because they have to you know consider the customers that they're supplying
but it makes it very hard especially if a husband and wife work at texas instruments
and one has vacation one time and one has vacation another time you know you're not in the same area
so you have to take a two week shut down and it's not at the same time
so that isn't too nice
this year they were going to try to do something different about that too they were going to try to schedule the whole site to go down at the same time
to eliminate that and that you're talking about five thousand people
so that's quite a feat in itself
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's great
yeah really that's excellent
yeah
yeah
yeah
well they're doing a lot with automation specialist also that's what i do
where you have to go to school to or run the new automated equipment it's all computerized and stuff
and there's a lot of job security in that because it takes so long to come up to an experience level where you're able to you know you have to be able to maintain them do the maintenance
diagnose what's wrong with the machine and you know do whatever it takes to get it started again and things
and interface with the technicians in the toolroom
so you're kind of like your own boss as far as the machinery goes
and it's about a two year to three year experience before you're able to really i would say payback
you know and do the job well
and you're still learning even after all that time because they're very complex machines
exactly that's right
yeah
and they offer a lot of opportunity to go to school
that's another good benefit that ti has and they'll pay for ninety percent of your schooling with no commitment to them
you know like a lot of companies will send you to school but you have to sign a paper that you'll work for them for five years
or you know to that affect
and you're kind of locked in so that if a career move comes up where you could take advantage of it you can't if you're you know signed in a contract
whereas at ti they don't do that
oh
oh
oh
yeah
well this part of the country there's no shortage of good schools
you know like mit and boston's only an hours drive from here
so a lot of the people can go you know to a good school
and right in rhode island there are some nice colleges too rhode island college and
uh-huh do you have any do you have any kids or
uh-huh
um-hum
i have used several techniques depending on what for undergraduate i you know my criteria were much different than like for graduate school
when i when i wanted to go to an undergraduate's institution i was looking for something that was you know rather small and easy to get around you know
graduate with a little you know with a name behind me rather than
yeah so
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
where did you go
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um-hum do you do you worry do you worry any about
being able i mean do you obviously you've taken precautions you know or measures to try and pay for your children's education but do you think that that's gonna be enough
no
yeah
yeah
yeah i all i all i can hope for is that i land a professorship at a at a nice heavy university and
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
well actually i've i you know it kind of caught me by surprise i haven't ever really thought about
you know mandatory public service i obviously believe in public service and you know think it's a good idea i i'm not sure if they would get
the service they anticipate if they force it do you understand what i'm saying i mean you know you're gonna get a lot more commitment a lot more desire a lot more
maybe quality time effort energy from somebody who really truly wants to be there so although i believe in it i'm not sure requiring it would be the way to go
um-hum
that's true if there were enough opportunities
well that or have something available in that field you know and when you go to employers then is it really a public service
thing or more of an internship you know i don't know
i definitely agree and i had you know some family that did serve in the peace corps and i always thought it was a wonderful thing
i do think that if people have the opportunity to do it it's something that you know they won't forget it enriches your life and gives you like you said a good understanding of
oh well what do i wanna say we take so much we take what we have for granted you know we're very blessed in this country and we take so much for granted because we really don't realize
how other cultures and other countries live so i definitely agree that it's good i just you know i
to require it i think would take a lot of forethought and planning if you wanna get the type of service you know that you're anticipating that you're hoping for
yeah
that's true
that's true and then i guess i can look around you know i automatically when the
switchboard suggested peace corps i kind of like you i thought international or going out of the country and i look around though and there's an awful lot of public service that could be done within our own communities and our own
you know a lot of times people say i don't wanna go somewhere else i wanna help my own community you know united way i want my dollars to work here something like that so that might also be a motivating factor then
minor offenses yeah
i agree i think that's a very good idea
what you said the field you're in what field are you in does it
okay
so you have to do it in that field actually
like if you like
yes
that's true well and it might also make them realize jeez this isn't what i thought it was i don't wanna do this that's a good idea
yeah
part of them i did were like a buffet and it i had
just different side dishes and appetizers and one of them that i'd remembered was
some sausage hors d'oeuvres and
cups of bisquick and
put that in and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and
make it all doughy and then like i just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes and they are so good
have you yeah
uh-huh
i i've used that quite a bit and it and it seems to work real well and
an a turkey and
yeah
um-hum
no what
uh-huh
oh i'll bet
yeah i'll have to try that
i like things that are easy and
nutritious
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah
right well i don't anymore yeah it's been a few years and
and spaghetti and
yeah
i know i don't think i've ever met anyone that didn't
yeah
oh yeah
i like it too
i do too
um-hum
yeah
yeah
and that's the way to do it too
that's good for you and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen and it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it
well
texas how you doing
good have you been participating in this program very much
oh okay
yeah i try to get one a day and i'm leaving the country here in next week and i want to get every i want to get as many as i can
okay bill you about ready to get started
bill what kind of a company you with
oh okay
right do you think the benefits package is fair
um-hum
yeah
yeah you sound like you sound like my own situation how old are you bill
oh hey i'm fifty seven sounds like same situation here
however recently i've had a chance to sample the outside and probably by industry standards we're probably in the top seventy percent
the i've really in fact what i'm doing is i'm retiring effective tuesday and going with another company
primarily for some of the things that you stated i've spent eight of my last ten years in offshore sites in asia
and i've just had a real ball
and which i don't like i got the opportunity to go with another company in fact a semiconductor assembly house that supplies us where the where the job will be a hundred percent going into their various plants trouble shooting
and i'm going to do that beginning the first of may
but interestingly enough though the biggest grind i've been with i've been with ti thirty two years
the biggest gripe in ti is the benefits package but as i go looking at other companies as i've had a chance to do it's really not all that bad
that the one of the biggest gripes of the benefit package is the insurance program and i guess they've all fallen victim to the high rising costs of medical care
and i think that's the type of thing that it that it amounts to what kind of vacation policy how long have you been with your company bill
oh neat when did you get into the when did you go through the break where you started getting four weeks
um-hum
um-hum
you get a full four weeks yeah we get two weeks after a year three weeks between five and fifteen and four weeks over fifteen
and are you allowed to how many days are you allowed to accrue
oh so you have to flush it out at the end of every year or you lose it
okay well we've got we're allowed to accrue a fair bunch i'm not exactly sure on a year to year basis what it is because i accrued most of mine before they put in the restrictions and then they grandfathered our old days
but what it what it the bottom line is that when you die retire or quit the most you can get paid for is seventy days
which is fourteen weeks which is which is a pretty nice little bonus so i think with retiring here in the next three days
i have eighty five days vacation and it would have been nice to been able to use up fifteen of them in april but i had so many things i had to do before i finished i didn't get to do that so i'm in essence going to be giving those back to the company or most of them back
but at least i get paid for seventy days which in your situation you don't i mean when you go out you probably get just the ones you have in that current year right
uh-huh that's interesting
oh okay well see we don't have any such thing as sick leave if you're exempt and you've been here over
three years or four years or something like that you can be sick up to six months and still get paid and that do you have a long and short term disability program
yeah and we get half pay or full pay for six months and half pay for the remainder of the disability i guess how it works
and that's interesting how many vacation days do y'all get
yeah i meant holidays yeah
oh okay so it probably all adds up to the same
yeah it
yeah
no i guess that's true i guess see most of us and like yourself where you've got four weeks you can take plenty throughout the year and still have a week even if it weren't a company holiday you'd still have some time left over at christmas
and i guess what happens is we don't have christmas week we have christmas plus a day around christmas a day before or a day after as official holidays
but there's so many people that are so senior and have so much time off so much vacation time coming that you will find virtually no one in the plant
yeah
yeah so they're all gone
yeah that's what happened to us i think the last the last holiday we got was in the middle seventies
and that one was the friday after thanksgiving and i think the reason we got it for a holiday was nobody worked it anyway
it just kept us from taking a day's vacation
we get we get new years day good friday memorial day july fourth labor day thanksgiving and the day after and then christmas and a day either side of it
which comes out to about nine and just since i've been here i mean when i got here we didn't even get memorial day
and we got and good friday came along i think in about nineteen seventy we got a chance to vote on it and we had to vote on that versus the friday after thanksgiving because we didn't get that day then
and i always felt that it wasn't a religious motive that gave us good friday the employees voted for good friday it was just that new years day to memorial day was such a long stretch without a holiday it was nice to put one in there in the spring
oh okay so you
yeah are you fairly satisfied with your health insurance
yeah
oh my goodness
my goodness that's tough we had we've been with aetna actually i think we fund our own insurance program aetna just administers paying the bills
yeah and the they started out with having managed mental health care
and then they went to managed hospital network where you had to go to a network hospital and we just got a notice the other day saying that we're going to have network doctors
and they're going to the way they're going to work into this is they're going to look at the doctors that have been providing care for people
no kidding
well i do not know how big a city is rome i mean you have heard about dallas and the crime here is pretty bad
yeah i was going to say
uh-huh
yeah have you ever been there
oh okay
are base that's interesting concept are bases safe you know
yeah the minimize the access
uh-huh
oh no
sure oh great that's wonderful yeah well dallas we lived in minneapolis we moved here about ten months ago and
dallas is pretty well we live in north dallas which is like a suburb near a suburb called plano so we are out of the city but it is
it is bad everywhere in terms of you know the handgun situation the number of rapes the number of muggings just it's
i wouldn't say it's as bad as new york but it is pretty scary you know people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods and you know they call them ornamental grates but they're still bars
yeah it really does and if you're a little bit claustrophobic but i don't know i mean the jails are crowded i i'm not a criminal justice specialist so i don't know what you know what can be done i'm
you know
uh-huh
oh
were they teenagers or like that girl in new york that got beat up by you know when she was jogging in central park a couple of years ago
huh yeah but they so they weren't you know and were they were they were they obviously poor or you know that is really sick
yeah unless they stole it and i mean that is one big thing down here i mean they have like and they're not all young i mean they're eighteen to twenty four some of the young men and women but
i mean you can you can see the crime stoppers ads on television or sometimes it's the same people that have been that have been observed and they still can't catch them
and the child had and he they said that he was twelve years old and he had he had not displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever you know and you are thinking to yourself i know
that and i don't think a lot of parents i mean i don't i don't know how it is in the air force base but i just don't think a lot of people because of the economy both need to work you know i just don't think a lot of parents are that involved any more
it was sort of like there were boundaries and i do not think i do not know i think today a lot of parents are ruled by their kids i
i see even people that work with me that are ten years younger that you know they kind of have an attitude i hate to say it but it's that's just what it is it is an attitude like the world owes them something
do you
are you in the air force okay
sure
right
right and the air force is one of the bitter better military supposedly military experiences i mean
pardon me
that's the way to do it i mean and that's you know at least the air force is i don't know i just
i am nervous in dallas i mean i you know i mean i go to like an aerobics class or something and i you know i seventy women in your average size exercise class in a public parks and rec building and you are supposed to feel safe but then there are all these
it doesn't matter race but you know it's an inter-racial mix and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards
and i do not even think that way but i mean you just think to yourself
you just i mean nobody can think that it can't happen to them no matter who they are or where they are at you know
i mean did you i do not know i was in the grocery store this morning we
went to new orleans for four days and came back late last night driving it's about seven hours and that's a very we had never been there that's a very neat town to visit in terms of the french quarter and all of the things you hear about but the crime is so bad there
i mean in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do how to carry your wallet
new orleans yeah
i would never yeah you just don't even bother it's not worth it the when we came back i don't know if you have seen i was in the super market this morning and on the cover of time magazine there is a girl
she is in boston she is on the east coast somewhere real attractive young girl college freshman i college coed i think she is a freshman
she'd been dating a fellow for several weeks and they went back to her dorm room and date rape i mean and it just
she looked anguished i mean it was really just sad i mean didn't pick it up and read it but i should have but i just looked at the picture and thought what a world
i mean i do not yeah i do not have any cure
no you really can't i mean i they we lease out a really nice two story town home in north dallas and
they have a real big thing here people i mean even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting you know they everybody wants your business kind of thing and my husband is the kind of guy he's
he's sometime he was raised on a farm in southern ohio near dayton and i think sometimes it is just he and i are very different in terms of that i mean i basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts
oh yeah and it does i mean it is it is not a reason i mean i have been to new york you shouldn't deny yourself going to visit and all that
but it is not any worse i used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by are you from boston
home owners savings and loan in boston and i know i never felt
i mean i've been to downtown new york city and i've been to downtown boston and i never felt any safer on milk street in boston staying at the meridian i didn't pay for but i mean i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city in any other city i have been in you know
so i would say one thing do not deny yourself the new york but experience but go with people that you know
no but i mean it yeah i don't know i mean i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals i think the handgun i'm not real big on guns myself so i mean
are the new york are the new york i do not know how the new york state prison system is but the
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know and then you think i mean i mean i can remember i haven't been out of school that long but it has been at least ten years and you think to yourself was it that bad back then
or is it just i think that like you said television is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it you know i mean people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something
uh-huh
it is yeah isn't it something i mean i have a i am originally from pittsburgh pennsylvania and i have a niece and nephew and i just
you know it is just i think kids get too much too fast and all those sort of things in atlanta where my inlaws live they had that thing you know the high top sneakers the air jordans et cetera
kids killing each other and beating their brains out you know right or the or the jackets the team like the raiders and the caps you know stealing the hundred dollar jackets
i mean it is i guess it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they in boston that is crime where they videoed that is probably one of the most bizarre i have heard of where they videotape themselves
i have a schnauzer and i have a sheltie
it it's a miniature um-hum hm
oh okay well the schnauzer i'm watching for one of the managers where i work and he's been transferred to germany for a while
and i'm taking care of his dog and i had just got the kitten when he asked me that and he says well my dog doesn't like cats and i said well we won't tell him it's a we won't tell her it's a cat
because it was a kitten and you know they just they just love kittens they just are fascinated
it's a sheltie she's real sweet little dog she's got a very nice temperament they're not as aggressive as a schnauzer you know the schnauzers are a little aggressive
um-hum
they're a good temperament and they
yeah that that's maybe that's there's some credence in that statement
um-hum
i i'd i really don't know what the best pet is i guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal
hm
are they really i don't think i've ever seen one
oh they train them to be that way then oh okay
oh okay
oh dear so the poor animal is doing it in self protection oh dear
um-hum
um-hum
after the reputation that you know they have quite an notable reputation as far as you know
yeah they're banned from in some areas i understand um-hum
oh okay
oh okay uh-huh
uh-huh
oh did it attack the child then
uh-huh
well the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that
none
sure yeah
oh yeah
looks that way i'm a little disappointed i and i think people
well he's won a peace prize and
yeah
yeah
huh
yeah
yeah
well
i'm curious what texans think of their neighboring state and recent gubernatorial race there with david duke
how was the what was the press like in texas over that issue
uh-huh
you know the kind of background he's got and i'm just surprised that he has
seems like that'd be something that be so controversial that it pretty well exclude himself from any political office
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
hispanics and
not too many blacks
uh-huh
uh-huh
that was the extent of it huh
i'll say there's they sure dominate the pro sports don't they and well and collegiate too so
uh-huh
well i don't know how much that would do for the budget though i mean that has helped the economy as a whole you know american jobs and all but
yeah if we bought more american stuff i guess that's more american taxes
i guess you know it's like your own home budget you know you can either earn more money or you can
spend less
and you know just like you and i have to make choices like that i think the government has to do it too
to
to other countries
that's because
we're supposed to be the rich ones with all the money to give away
as you know as far as how much money we've got in the whole country we're still bigger than anybody else
yeah that's an important thing we've got we've got a lot of people who are getting money the from the government for this that and the other thing
and it would probably help if we could figure out how to get them to put money back into the system instead you know
you take someone on welfare and you give them a job and they're paying income taxes all of a sudden you've changed it around and it's going in the other direction
yeah
yes i am
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah that's what i don't understand
yeah you wonder you know when is it going to happen to me
yeah
um-hum
yeah
well i don't think the problem so much is abuse
i think the problem is just the government is trying to do too much
i mean who where does it say that the government's supposed to be the one to take care of all of the people that are homeless or hungry or et cetera et cetera
and where does it say that if someone is short that they can go to the government and get a handout
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
no they're not
yeah
yeah
yeah
you know i think you know i've got a fairly decent job here at ti but when i think of you go to the grocery store and you see someone working as a cashier and you think you know how much a cashier makes and you go how do these people get by
because i know how hard it is for me to get by
yeah
we could go run for office
um-hum
well the thing is you know who's really in charge of deciding how the money gets spent
and it's you know it's not the president the president just suggests it the ones who actually you know debate it and decide it is the is the congress
and you know what the congress is out for they're
they're going to do whatever it takes to make their voters happy which means bring more jobs and more federal spending to their little area
and
and that means every congressman is sitting there working for money going to his area nobody's working on less money going to his area or on anybody else's area
and if you just if you just looked at how much congress spends on itself it's ridiculous
well now the thing is
yeah they're cutting defense which is you know there are people out there working for defense contractors who are losing money but i don't mind because i think you know government is not there to give me a job government
the defense is there to defend our country and they do it for whatever you know they spend whatever money they need to do that but i don't want them to break the budget just so that i can have a job
so that i can go get a good job with someone who's not you know not making defense stuff
if you know what i mean
yeah
um-hum
well he didn't have much choice really
yeah
but defense is not the biggest part of the federal budget either the biggest part of the budget are things like medicare and social security
and
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah you know how fast your ti medical insurance has been going up right
well just think the federal government's insurance bill has medicare and that's been going through the roof
and that's why you know that's the biggest increase in federal spending right there
think we need to figure out a way to make medical care cheaper
why is this stuff so expensive why is the cost going up so incredibly fast
you know because it's coming out of my paycheck it's coming out of your paycheck and it's coming out of our taxes too
why is these hospitals making so much money
oh there's a whole lot of countries in europe that do that sweden denmark norway
it's free for everybody
everybody in the like i lived in denmark for a couple of years
and medical care there is free you just go and say i want your help and they'll help you there's couple of things though first of all it's not
as high a quality as we expect here because it's paid for by the government instead of by us
and second your taxes are a lot higher
an awful lot higher we're talking fifty percent something like that
they are paying for it
and the and the just the quality of care is not as good either
there has got to be a middle ground i think canada's got a good answer but i don't know many details about it
it's some sort of government program i've heard a lot of people say good things about it but i just don't know the details on it
well something's going to have to change but you look at the congress and you look how many of them get reelected and they're the one's that have got to make the changes
i mean i don't see anything changing because you've got the same old people in there
yeah
single
yeah
hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum what's really terrible is they can do this to you know and you don't really have that much of a choice as to whether or not you take it because the government says if you're going to drive a car you've got to have the insurance
they're not helping you be able to afford the insurance that they're making you buy
hi
i'm jerry crow from dallas
i'm jerry crow from dallas
where you from
in virginia golly
oh i had first had thought this was just texas instruments but apparently it's not just texas instruments
yeah i've talked to some people from attleboro
massachusetts
several of those people
uh-huh yeah i work in lewisville which is just outside of dallas
well our topic is tv shows you ready to get started
yeah what we like about them our favorites and so forth
okay i'll go ahead and punch one
okay i guess my favorites are probably the news format programs like hard copy sixty minutes twenty current affair things like that
yeah
yeah
we don't have cable unfortunately so we just get but we've got plenty of local stations to look at
but
yeah
about the only reason i would want cable probably is for some of the sports programs
that they don't show local
like hsen espn
but the movie cables or movie channels they show the same shows over and over and over
and they're usually
yeah
but do you have small kids
okay
oh
i wished i could do that i've been ti thirty two years
yeah but i'm only fifty seven
so i've still got a few years to go
yeah
yeah
well i've had enough of it but unfortunately they don't pay enough
for early retirement
no huh-uh no all my kids are grown married
uh-huh
yeah
but
every once in a while i like to watch some of the old movies i watched a clint eastwood movie last night
yeah oh yeah in fact it's on tonight
yeah it ought to be a good game tonight
it doesn't start until seven o'clock our time so we still got another hour
are you all what time is it there it's six o'clock here now
seven o'clock so you all are behind us
yeah
but
yeah makes it so late well we're fixing to go on daylight saving time next this next weekend
so we have to run our clocks up forward an hour and i sure do hate to loose that hour of sleep in the morning
yeah
well i guess like i said my favorite show what's your favorite shows or you like the news formats
yeah
yeah i like the true life adventures too
yeah
yeah
i don't watch too much of the of the network shows i all i like to watch
let's see some of the prime time shows that i like to watch like i said or other news formats but then every once in a while i'll watch star search
but
not too many of the situation comedies do i care for
and i'm definitely not a soap fan
yeah or i
yeah and i like totally hidden video
and what is it
bloopers and practical jokes
but
i don't know how people stay at home and watch soaps and get involved in them but
i guess plenty of people do
yeah in fact i think you can even order a magazine that keeps you up to date every day of what happened on every particular soap in case you miss it
but
that that's not real life to me so
yeah
well i enjoyed talking with you and
and how how's you all's weather up there you cold
yeah
yeah
well you
yeah did you have a good easter
yeah we did too
i told my wife i sure do wish they'd gave us monday off rather than friday off
because sunday was really busy
yeah company and then we went and visited the daughter and didn't get i don't guess we got to bed till about eleven thirty
and then having to get up and go to work the next morning
well you have a good day
oh okay bye-bye
was a loud one
i'm against it
uh-huh
yes
there you can't enforce the laws you got why do you want to pass some more
uh-huh
that's correct i don't know how maybe that's i agree one hundred percent i just what irritates me i guess is that they keep wanting to pass gun control laws that do nothing but take away your constitutional amendments
and that is that is really not gun control is not the problem
it's the people using the guns
and all they're doing is look at this new brady bill
the seven day waiting period that does not deter anybody who really that wants to buy a gun
there's spots here in austin
on sixth street to eleventh east of the interstate
and you stand in an alley down there and buy anything you want
i mean you know and
whether you want guns drugs women anything
yeah
true
you can make two phone calls if you know if you know anybody here in town
you can make two phone calls and have automatic weapons
the law's just you know it's
they can't enforce what they have you know and i'm not a big fan of peter jennings peculiarly
but he was on one of the on the talk shows one time they had kennedy on there and brady mrs gonzalez and some of the other liberals but you know
and he pulled this big stack of papers out that was about oh four feet tall he said these are all the current gun laws you have the books if you can't enforce these why do you think you can pass another one and enforce it
but
the brady bill won't do anything but just make it harder for the people that are honest to buy one those that are criminals which are the ones that are refusing guns in the first place they're not going to walk in and buy one anyway
well the proper solution is education of the masses
you've got to educate the people in using the weapons
and you know our forefathers you know everybody carried a gun here in texas
you know for you know a couple of hundred years
that's true unless of course there was you know
sufficient provocation which we have basically the same thing now it's just that all the honest people you know the citizens as it were no longer carry guns to defend themselves because only the criminals are
oh yeah
oh yeah i have a class one license
and i go up and help him you know work in the store and stuff like that and it it's amazing the number of people that are buying guns and the reason they're buying them is they want to give their wife one to carry in the car with them
and that some of the woman will come in and they'll look around and they'll try and find a small one to fit inside their purse
and
well if you get one you know
you're single i take it
are you single i take it
yeah okay
yeah
well my wife before we got married she didn't carry any sort of thing and
i i've got
i've acquired you know her you know bought several that i give her to carry one of them she carries in her purse
and there's some in the car i always have one in my truck when i'm driving any place
you know knives or mace or something but
well it's a sad state of affairs when have to but you know they're are more and more homes are getting broken into and everybody says well
it's because of guns no it's not because of the guns it's because of the people and actually they're breaking in
to the homes and using weapons to buy drugs although you do have those that you know like the idiot who ran out and grabbed that ak-47 and shot everybody up at the mcdonald's in california
you know that you know we're talking about somebody whose crazy having a gun law is not going to stop him because he's going to find one
and
yeah well you know california
california hawaii and new york state have these and
now new jersey had the stiffest gun laws
oh yeah but you know where are the most crimes committed new york state
as you know john lennon was you know you know was shot and killed
in new york by a guy that bought a gun in hawaii which has a tough gun law
and you know i mean this clown out in california he had a criminal record you know a mile long
but he still had not one but several
he shot up that allstate or that gmc credit place in florida
well he went out and bought six different guns
you know and he had a criminal record
oh yeah
and there are
yeah they're people doing that so i mean the solution is not to pass more laws than you can't enforce because they're going to pass one now they're trying too either the staggers bill or the brady bill
either way they do it it's going to cost you and me more money
and we're going to increase the bureaucracy that's supposed to handle it and
what are they going to do they're going to punch your name in the computer and you're going to come up as no you're not a criminal and no and no you have no criminal record you know and yeah you can by gun
but that doesn't say that you're not going to walk outside and three days later shoot somebody
you know there's no substitute for people
oh yeah
actually guns are not the prime weapon used in killing people in crimes of passion or whatever
it's knives and baseball bats
yeah
oh yeah
see you can walk down the street carrying a baseball bat and nobody thinks anything about it
you know and how many times have you seen people walking down the street carrying a baseball bat
you figure what little leaguers on their way to practice
they could be gang members just as easy
if you
oh yeah it's quite a deal
nobody pays attention to a baseball bat
you know
yeah so why you know
yeah
or knives you can have knives everybody's got knives course you course you're limited you know you can't have switchblades and stuff
but
you know guns are used but so is everything else
if you're going to ban that if you're going to band guns i've got an article in the wall street journal where they had where they had used a satire
where someone in new york had suggested all the guns because they were used for commission of drug regulated crimes
and they immediately decided well lets start banning the public telephones
bless you
and they said well let's band the public telephones too because the public telephones are used in the commission of drug related crimes
makes about as much sense
and if the united states does not trust me enough to have a gun after that then i don't trust them enough to govern me
but i'm kind of radical on that i just you know
well i see too much of it and i see people come into the shop up there and you know and i buy guns and they haven't got the faintest idea what you are doing
you know and they want to buy a gun now i think there should be some sort of id card that you carry
there's an application you fill out now
it's a yellow form
but see that's it's just another piece of paperwork it asks for your name your address and phone number and the county where you birth and all and you know and then there's a list of ten questions you answer and
if you answer no to all of them that means you're a good american
you such seriously and
it's a little yellow form you fill out and it puts the name and the serial number the gun who bought it and the date like that and that stays in the gun shop and it never goes anywhere
it stays right there we've got boxes full in the back room
and the only thing that it's used for is if alcohol tobacco and firearms come down and does an inspection
they look through and if they look through your legal logbook you have to log it down in and out well you got
and they and they
they don't come out very often
i've seen them once in about five years
but they come down
right
well that's true actually down here we don't have a big problem with air pollution mainly because we don't have anybody to either side of us
which helps out a lot as far as that goes
i wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when i lived up in boston and up in you know debates would come up there in massachusetts and
you know in that area over air pollution and their attitude's basically well prevailing ins winds are to the east so why should we have to worry
oh yes nothing
right
oh absolutely yeah just muggy
so yes i think yeah i think you're right our most pollute substance down here is just water
but
hey
i think you know the biggest causes though even then a lot of times are like when i was up in boston just all the cars
you know all over the place you just got a lot of
you know a lot of pollution from those and you know if you don't have a wind it sticks around
absolutely
right
that's very true
you know of course then when you're not recycling you've got these incendiary plants and stuff that can be some pretty disgusting stuff
going up in the atmosphere
but i you know you've got you've got the industry you've got that and you got the cars and i think the cars are where it's at right now as far as pollution goes
air pollution i mean
right
i guess so
right i you know i don't know in the air down here what they do
i haven't run across any major pollutants down there that i i've really seen a lot of
you know upsettedness about
i know i've seen like my grandparents live in corpus christi texas and i know they've there's a lot of refineries down there
that's some pretty potent stuff they can put up in the air
i but i don't know how yeah there's a difference in what you can smell and what you know what's bad
well i like lots of different kinds of music
my
upbringing was in classical music but i really enjoy
all different kinds of music for example
i really get a kick out of rush and pink floyd
oh yeah
no i don't think so
yeah i'm sure it was i also like jazz
well yeah i like fusion but i also like the classics
yeah he's great
he is he's very good
yeah now i saw him along time ago before he had achieved fame at the jazz festival they had in cleveland
yeah he is really good i even enjoy some of the old timers like even from like the big band era like bennie goodman or
i saw him play when i was a kid also of course by that time he was he was an old man but it was still fun to listen too him
right
yeah no i haven't
yeah
yeah i did too i one of the things given my classical background one of the things that really turns me on is when the musicians are creative with their instrumentation
as well as you know the typical creative lyrics or melodies i also like that's one of the reasons for example that i like rush is because it's not always
you know in two or in four even meter you know they mix it up they do interesting things with rhythms and they do interesting things with
yeah and also getty lee on the base
it's not -st a straight base line that just repeats over and over and over again like on the pop tunes it right it changes up
yeah i play oboe and english horn in fact i've actually started playing again
i played when i was up through college in my first year of college and then college got the best of me and then i got married and had kids and i really haven't had very much time to play but i found a friend
i met somebody in town who became friendly with and discovered that we both played oboe in college so we've been trying to get together once a month or every couple of weeks and
and play a little bit mostly it's mostly remedial work for us because we we're both out of shape
oh cool
yeah well also if you take lessons you might be able to
nip bad habits before they start
all right
i think i tend to prefer ethnic restaurants rather than steak houses or simply american food or even the southwest food
frequently we enjoy trying a new kind of a place and to try to see what their style of food is and what kind of spices and things they use in it
so that's what me we mostly do what do you prefer when you go out
oh you do
oh yes really very much i think that the tex-mex food has become a kind of a standard enjoyed food in our home and i've
even learned to make a few things at home myself and that's why i said sometimes when we go out i would
not because i don't like it but because we tend to like it and even have it at home i'd rather try something else um-hum yeah uh-huh
i'm not a big steak or rib or roast beef eater although to be honest with you at holiday time at christmas
i always buy a standing prime rib and make some yorkshire pudding and gravy and totally enjoy it and then can table that for six months to eight months to another year so
and you know we're trying not to eat those big meats also with all of that health consciousness
believe me we're not fanatics in that line but if we enjoy other things then we'll tend to go that way
a nice chinese once in a while is very tasty and we recently went to an ethiopian restaurant and sampled that kind of food rather different
but have you been to any place lately that you enjoyed
um-hum
oh
oh my
oh
um-hum
is that right
oh
oh my uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
okay go ahead
that
okay
oh good
right um-hum
um-hum when you go out i
um-hum i don't blame you i think that's an important part of relaxing that you don't have to do the work yourself um-hum
oh
do you have a preference to a place for sunday brunch
oh yes i'm familiar with that um-hum
well i have not really been there to have the brunch um-hum
is that what it is statistically
right truly an epidemic
um-hum
do you know if that exists today in a cross country kind of collective
uh-huh
yes
exactly
do you think that the visibility is part of what is keeping it in the limelight the fact that the funding sources are being discussed so regularly is because
um-hum
it's true it's a different level of publicity um-hum
sure
um-hum
i agree with you i do believe that there should be a greater amount of funding sources set aside for it but i
i know that the visibility of it is part of what's causing it to get this attention now and i would hope that the emphasis would continue over the long term i mean i'm surprised to see
on a regular basis that the statistics are higher and yet
it's such a benign kind of a thing it seems like it's been with us for a long time and it's such a
that may be the other issue that it's reaching epidemic proportions and we have
um-hum
um-hum
yes and i don't know that it may not be
um-hum
um-hum
do you have a favorite credit card that you use
because any particular reason
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i know what you mean
uh-huh
oh really wow
well i use a credit card that's given out by us air
well not given out i mean there's an annual fee and the neat thing about the credit card is for every dollar that you charge you get one frequent flyer mile
and even things that we wouldn't normally charge now we charge because we've racked up seriously close in the past couple years close to five or six thousand dollars just by charging
and it's really great because you can get some good discounts on us air you know using frequent flyer mileage and all that
and the annual fee isn't bad i think it's maybe thirty five dollars a year
and here in rochester maybe in pennsylvania also but you can charge your groceries
can you do that there
which is great
oh
oh do they accept discover or no
um-hum yeah
well i love it and now actually our mortgage company is starting i think june first or something is going to start allowing people to charge their mortgage
and that's going to be great
and in the beginning we were having a problem because we would charge everything and then get this enormous bill
and just be totally wiped out because one thing i hate is paying interest
i refuse to pay interest if i'm going to do that i'm not going to use a credit card
so what i do now is i work it like a checkbook and every time i charge something i write it rout i write it out
so i'm not fooling myself into thinking i have that money
you know i write it out and then it's as if i paid in cash
so you're somebody that will pay off your bills right away
um-hum
um-hum yep i know what you mean
oh
well that makes sense
right
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
really
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
a yeah
seem
um-hum it's definitely worth it if you pay off your bills in full then credit cards are a real good idea
because you don't have to carry a whole lot of cash and you get the interest you know if you charge at the beginning of the month then you're getting a month's worth of interest
in your account
but the second you let it go even one month they had made an error on our statement where they never posted the payment yet i had the canceled check i had everything
and i mean for that amount it was like a thirty dollar interest charge
that's like another purchase for me it buying something
yeah but you know one thing one of the reasons because i have some of those cards that you mentioned and i think about it and a lot of reason i have those cards is because j c penney offered you know a free gift if you buy it
yeah or five dollars off this purchase if you know sign up and
and as long as it because i don't j c penney doesn't cost you anything i don't think
right and so as long as it doesn't cost you anything then
oh yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum oh yeah
um-hum
oh right
wow that is great
um-hum
right and that's thirty dollars that you didn't pay any money to have it in the first place
um-hum
one thing i still don't understand about credit cards is
how you can borrow money off a credit card i still haven't quite figured that out
i know i don't trust it either and i know you can do it with a visa card but it just seems like too simple and i know that there's some hidden
yeah
yeah
on your what
oh just yeah the machine
one thing that does scare me a little bit about my credit card is when i am giving it over the phone
or you know if i tend to buy a lot of things from tv like not the shopper's thing but sometimes they'll be something good that they're selling a record or something like that and
and after i do it i think god who did i give my number to
and you know what are they going to do with it how can i trust them or whatever
but the credit card company i did have a charge on there once that i had no receipt for i had no recollection i didn't even know the store
and they took it right off no questions i just said this isn't my charge if you can prove that it is then great if you can't then you know just take it off
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah
yeah they would pursue it definitely
yeah
oh yeah
um-hum yeah
right
right yeah that's true before you could at least deduct if you did pay any interest you could at least deduct that from your taxes
but now you can't do it and i know people that have racked up
they keep getting their limit extended because they keep exceeding it
and then and all they can do is pay the minimum balance or not that you know
oh
nope they're not even touching it
i know
right
yeah it's true though because then all they end up doing is spending more of their time making collection calls
oh yeah some people are they really are i mean if they have if they know they have more on their limit
he can't because to him it's like money to him it's like a loan almost in a sense and he can't bear to
no i can't either
um-hum
yeah
i know
oh my god
um-hum
yeah
all right
oh
yeah i used to go to a gym last summer but then i started school again so it's so i don't exercise as much as i'd like
but i do enjoy going to a gym and working out or just like i do sit ups sometimes before i go to bed or when i wake up and i ride a exercise bike a lot so
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
oh
right
oh that's good
um-hum
uh-huh
hm
yeah
oh yeah
yeah it does yeah i enjoy that a lot i bike in the summer i belong to a biking club here in kenosha
but i'm not that energetic i can get lazy sometimes
yeah
oh yeah that's what i like to do
um-hum yeah
yeah
yeah i don't swim much neither
yeah
um-hum
oh
yeah nice talking to you
ah
i currently have an eighty seven five liter mustang gt that i've done a bunch of modifications to make it handle and perform better
i probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a lotus or possibly a ferrari
a three twenty eight gts
you just go hunting go out and lust after it
so have you had the opportunity to drive a ferrari
oh
ah
could sleep in the back of the vette
i find that the corvettes are becoming really nice cars
yeah and they've improved the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive
it's not like driving a winnebago or something
nice yeah nice isn't the word i'd choose maybe practical isn't that a practical van
yeah it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive
oh so it was a completely new experience for you and i'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it
right
and you and you couldn't get how long does it take to go back up about the same time
yeah so
so you won't get
yeah and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial
whoops
yeah
with the bluebonnets out yeah it really was yeah i decided that austin is certainly someplace that i could handle living
um-hum
right
well it's kind of difficult for me because right now like most teachers i'm laid off
i spend most you know i substitute a lot
so it's a lot it's very hard on a nonfixed income because i don't know how many days i'm going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances
you know more or less split up between all of us
and just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day
no i'm a single mother i have three children
so right now we're on we get you know aid from the state
so right now i know what i'm getting from the state and i have to balance more or less
what i get from the state with my bills and you know try to work as many days as possible
any time they call me in but i still have to figure out if i work too many days then i lose all my state aid
and if i don't work enough days then i don't get enough to meet the bills and it's like a juggling act every single month
like this week i've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation
so you know the four days before they only have a four day week and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in
they don't like to be absent before a vacation
but we're shopping around as far as well i'm shopping around as far as trying to get that's why i'm doing this to get some extra money
and getting pledge sheets for the boy scouts my kids are in boy scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the boy scouts because every penny i bring in is ten percent to me
i guess we're in the situation that a lot of you know middle class americans are in
oh my lord
really
um-hum
ah
sure
right
um-hum definitely
yes we do and we try to you know i keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in you know every single day i'm at the computer
and it's like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasn't come in yet you know
well my brother-in-law sent me the thing
right uh-huh and we're supposed to talk on voting is that right
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
boy i'll say
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's an idea
yeah we have the voting but i never heard of
oh wow
oh
right so when we vote it's like you say there's it's a handful of votes makes a difference in fact this last november they had a
vote and i think there was only like oh five to ten votes within the three different
you know the three different people that were for the office of
yes
in each of them and so like you say it makes a difference but that's a good idea about having it the voting over the phone maybe someday it will
uh-huh
yeah
right
right and you know i wonder i don't know what the
satistics are but i wonder what age the least has the least good turn out for the voting
i wonder if it's the younger people or the older people or just in the middle-aged or who it is that doesn't turn out my guess would be the younger
um-hum
oh
oh
oh just because they don't care
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right and i don't know how big of a problem this is but i wonder if i've heard some people say on occasion that
uh-huh
right that that's some that's saying hey you know we want somebody
right
right we have
they counted them by hand you know the ballots by hand and i know that on the bigger ones they have little it's a punch card system are you familiar with that
right you with your pencil you just punch you know they have a little tray that holds the ballots
and apparently it makes the counting a lot easier for the
by hand and i really liked the punch card one because we got the results so much sooner when it was over
uh-huh
oh yeah that would be they probably can turn those results in
uh-huh
oh
oh wow that's fascinating
oh so have you ever run for any kind of
yeah i did the same thing actually i don't have a i'm not subscribing anymore
are you unhappy with the with the how should i say it
the one-sidedness of it or the
my problem is that they just don't
how should i say it i can either get things on one side or the other but not a meaningful discussion
that relates to well how should i say i either get these highly polarized things
and sometimes they're i say okay we're going to we're going to do
we're going to be fair so we're going to present two highly polarized articles which is better than one but
so anyway so we're
one of the problems the other problem that i have is that
as you said a lot of the articles are they're either fluff
well actually out of the press they're fluff or they're
pretty shallow but
course i also have the option and i guess you do too of signing up for one of these
specialty magazines which is like in the case of
science you know you sign up for
nature or something like that but
but when it comes to news it's a i find it i think the reason perhaps for that is that the
the press like everything else is becoming a
how should i say is becoming
they're not neighborhood press anymore
they're worried more they're more like u s a today type things pretty shallow and can we make it and they're run by you have ten newspapers that are run by
yeah
oh yeah that's yes that's one of the most that's how i found out about this
well there are some places here in town for people that are
having withdrawal pains so to speak there's a bookstore that has a
subscription type thing where you can pay the guy forty dollars a year which is pretty small potatoes
yeah call in on the modem and you can read your news and i mean read your mail and look at the all the different internet
groups
so let's see what was the topic i forgot oh we are supposed to talk
yeah do you have any children
oh did you where did you go
clarion
huh
would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i know i kind of feel the same way i just finished college a couple years ago and i
you know it was while i had my family and everything and it was a lot harder but you know i went to a college that was fairly local and i feel like my education you know you get out of it what you put into it i think
but you know i know it's some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever
i do not know i guess it a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something i do not know but
but
uh-huh
yeah
is that why you picked the school you did or
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
so you lived there at school then
you lived there at school
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh and that was for tuition and
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
for business
so are you working somewhere then or
oh i see where are you going to move to
oh are you do you have friends there or
oh i see
so does he work for a company down there
oh i see oh the big company
so yeah i i've been working for ti for about twelve years i guess so
but i'm not originally i'm originally from illinois
but you know i have gone to college i guess a few different places but i think you know for the most part
you know the teachers have been pretty good and i've got out of it what i've what i put into it
so
but you know i think i think that's most of it personally but that's why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go and i am going to try to help them financially but i think you know
financially i'm there's only so much i can do for them and i'll say you know here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but
otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and i will try to try to help you
but
i do not know you know the financial end of it like you said i put my wife through school too of course ti paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but still was a challenge to do
and
so i think you know financially that's one of the big aspects
you know you
right
yeah well did you since you were paid for school yourself did do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
uh-huh yeah
yeah right
yeah well see i think
you know i've known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it and i guess it depends on the way you were raised too but if you grow to expect that you know you kind of go there as sort of a vacation
you know i that's the way a lot of my friends did it and you know they weren't they didn't take it very serious i know i took it real serious because i didn't start to college until you know
i was about eight or ten years and you know out of what i should have been in school
but you know so i think that helped me be real serious about it and i ended up graduating with like a three point six
yeah so i you know and that was hard cause i had two kids and you know a family and everything else so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time but
yeah you are right exactly
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right
right well my wife was sort of in the same situation she was she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go for
and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it
but you know by then she had practically got her degree so you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i think i think you are right when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say man i really need this
i think the last one that we actually went to go see
well there's two i took my kids to see 101 dalmatians of course they wanted to see it they had the disney book and they thought that was wonderful and they loved the dogs and
so yes we went with some friends of ours and i was a little worried about my son he's about two and a half and
he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them and can't see them
yeah so that kind of bothered him but after that he did fine
yeah he'll be three in january
yeah
yeah
wasn't that good
oh no
well i like to watch the movies but it's gotten so expensive that we wait until they come out on video and we rent them
and now we did go see home alone at the dollar movie and that was just hilarious i died
and we did also we went to see what about bob one night which is a funny movie with
it's a funny movie
that's true
the money goes to their heads or goes to something you know they grow up too fast so
yeah
i've heard that's good yeah so i think there's a bunch of good movies coming out my kids wanna see rescuers down under
so i'm going to my vcr went on the blitz about two weeks ago so i'm getting it fixed right now because they have their little movies their little you know disney movies they watch all the time and stuff and
yeah
do you know
you know and they don't last that long
oh that's pretty decent
yeah
that makes it worth it but
a lot of the disney movies it's just too expensive and i can rent them or i can make a copy you know my daughter's in love with the little mermaid and i have a copy that's just about worn out she's four
yes
oh i saw
oh and see my kids weren't in the you're right i watched it without them
huh
huh
yes
yes
we have one
yes ma'am
do you wish you
i don't use it as much as my children and my husband do my actually my husband and i are taking a class at our local junior college
called microcomputers 101 and we're just
touching on database spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of you know different kinds of storage and we're just kind of touching on
we have an ibm compatible it's gateway brand
have educational programs
yeah what kind of a computer do you use at work
uh-huh
uh-huh
right i worked on my airline apollo focal point computer for about four years
but i missed
oh okay this is
this is my very first time yes
oh okay
oh
i
where do you work
oh i see well this is a pretty good deal
uh-huh
uh-huh oh you do know lotus huh oh that's great that's something we want to learn
oh
i've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it
that's great
uh-huh
i have a question on this thing that i'm this survey or whatever you know this i volunteered for
do i start calling in myself or do i wait for people to call me
right an eight hundred number
oh only one a day
right
oh
oh i see okay so then do you get the five bucks or do i
oh we both do well that's a heck of a deal
right i had to put that in well that's a pretty good deal so why are we doing this
uh-huh
oh
it's almost like that
like a voice command computer type thing oh
well that's wonderful
i see different kinds of voices and
and i and i think that i don't i mean to you but you know
and you're in what city
okay my sister one of my sisters lives in plano
is that right outside of
how about that i probably went through richardson then
and then i have a sister that lives in austin
well we're actually all from nebraska they just are recently moved there my brother-in-law is director of admissions at the university of texas in dallas
yeah and then my sister works at the air force base
actually yes they both have personal computers
i think they just send christmas letters on it as far as i mostly my one sister uses hers for
her children you know children's games
so but i do all of my programming on the mainframe and i don't have a lot of opportunity to work on the pc except at home
so i find it very interesting how about you
um-hum
um-hum
do you like the mac real well
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's true that's very true
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
as a tool um-hum okay
oh that sounds interesting too
uh-huh i understand that you have to have a certain i mean either you like them or you don't i think a lot of the people are afraid of them
are intimidated by them i guess more than anything until they get to learn what they can do and how it can work
so
uh-huh
when you're working with them
so um-hum yell at them and like to choke them so many times i wanna choke mine say you're not doing what i want you to do
right exactly and it seems a shame to have all that equipment but not do anything with it but one day i hope to do more
anyway
well thank you very much for calling okay have a good day bye-bye
okay
fantastic one thing that pops into my mind real quick is about the funding of the school system right now evidently that's a big problem
right
oh lord i mean yeah and you talk about stress and pressure i tell you what it's
do right
exactly and
or our state legislature can't come up with some kind of workable means to have funds for the school you know it's i just don't understand that
okay
okay so it's getting close
right
right
exactly
right that's true
exactly
right and you know one thing my wife and i've talked about it are private schools
you know whether we would want to invest in private schools as they're growing up because you know just in the dallas area we're not real comfortable with the with the public schools
right
i can definitely see on down the road you know when we do have kids and are getting to that age that's gonna be a definite concern
that's yeah and you know that's taxes is right now are political suicide you know and i don't think any politician's gonna do that so
exactly and you know it's gonna really hurt the middle class people i think because they're the ones that'll probably have to carry the brunt of the load
yeah now that's just unbelievable to me you know
right
exactly right
well no and you and you wanna encourage them you know to be active and everything in school but you know with all the peer pressure that's going on with all the negative things it is it's a tough environment to be growing up in
okay
right
that's right that's right
right
exactly
that's right
right
that's true that's true and
right
you know that's where they that's where they get the deep-rooted values and that's about right then you just have to hope and pray that everything works out works out okay
well you know there's the one that's burning in everybody's
in everybody's mind the break up of the soviet union and it's a
ah it's effects here at home
i mean it's gonna have effects all over the world and
course you know i expect in the next few days when the president gives his state of the union address
he's got to have to
pull some
real drastic changes in what he's doing to promote some
some movement and enthusiasm behind his reelection race
yeah
yeah well they focused all of their economic capacity on their military
i mean if they had focused the same capacity in their commercial stuff they would've been a lot better off as a society probably
yes like the japanese right
and
um-hum
well you know five years ago could you have imagined in your in your wildest dreams that something as a change as rapid as this would've occurred
it's just you know it it's almost unthinkable but it is hey in a i still wonder whether you know that it's going to be stable and then what's going to happen there
but i don't think the shelves -s bare anymore
i think there's now you know i think all the time there were goods
to be distributed that were being held off
and
you know i think that
there's but you know the people don't have a lot of money to pay for them there there's a tremendous
gap in their ability to supply themselves that could create a tremendous amount of political instability in fact they said tonight on the on the radio that
some leader in of the parliament in russia is calling for yeltsin to essentially throw out all of his ministers and replace them
because of this tremendous supply demand type gap that they have there
i don't know it it's
-t's hard to imagine managing such a rapid change
well and i think that you know we stand
in the possibility of in of being confronted with a similar kind of thing here everybody -s is calling for you know this
peace dividend and
it with an election year coming up there's the there's the
the possibility of everybody proposing something radical to
appeal to the voters to get elected but you know how rapidly can they change and how rapid can they move
okay
well i love to fish i haven't in the last few years but in fact
when i married on our honeymoon that's where we went was fishing
well i really do enjoy it but i like i say i haven't been for years we when after we got married a couple of years after we got married we got a boat and we used to fish a lot and you know we skied too but
after the kids came we stopped and now i'm divorced so
yeah they don't you know and especially when they're little like that it was difficult to have them in the boat we were always worried something would happen so we didn't
well i liked trolling the best i mean i like moving so instead of just sitting in one spot and i really do like to fish in the rain
yeah i and when it's not pouring i mean but when it's just a light rain i'm i really enjoy that and i find that you we use to catch a lot of fish when it was raining
do i pardon me say that cartoons yes
well see the thing is when i am from originally from ohio and i met my husband in iowa and we
he was from minnesota and we went on our honeymoon to minnesota so it was well it was in august and so it was warm enough but
i because i don't enjoy cold weather at all so we lived right by a lake and it was nice
no i have not i lived in the bahamas for a year but i didn't do any fishing we did some scuba diving but that's all
yes it's
it's gorgeous
ooh how nice
uh-huh
oh
i've never fished in a farm pond
no uh-huh
ooh
oh how wonderful relaxing too huh
oh that sounds great
oh
oh it sounds wonderful
no i know a lot of friends are really too hyper to fish they have to be moving all the time i think you have to be able to sit and just enjoy yourself quietly if you can't do that you're not going to make a good fisherman
right
well in this day and age that's wonderful to be able to do that because when we our lives are so stressful so
well
real sad to say we don't as much as we i'm divorced and since we've been to texas we haven't now in iowa when they were little my son i used to take him fishing and they both have you know gear and we've gone
once or twice but and there's just not that many lakes around here that i'd be interested in going to and so
you know and i just we just haven't and not that they i think they both would like it they have gone with their dad and he lives in arizona now and
he lives in the phoenix area and the mountains are real close and he's taken them up to the mountains and yeah
yeah and they've enjoyed it
it is
yes
yeah isn't that is amazing isn't it
well i can remember when i was trolling i caught a and we couldn't eat this it was a rock bass and of course they're not good to eat but i mean it was it was for me it was like a six pound fish and that was big for me and i was just tickled to death that
to catch it we threw it back in but that was i think the biggest fish i ever caught
but
well we in minnesota people just don't they don't eat them for some reason so
oh
is that right see we didn't know that so we just threw it back in so
yes it is
uh-huh
yeah
oh
uh-huh
yeah
no
is it
uh-huh
would you have to repeatedly cast though in the no
oh
oh that sounds great
well when i grew up when i was growing up my dad was an avid fisherman and we had a boat and we would go out in lake erie because i'm from ohio
and we would fish that was before it was so polluted and so yucky it was a beautiful lake then and we would we would fish and my dad would i can remember even when we were weren't interested in when we were younger and we'd play around the lake or around
and we'd go up into michigan and the rapids up there in grand rapids michigan were just beautiful and he would fish he would get his you know his waders on his long boots and he would go out and we would just play by the water and just have a ball and he would fish and it was so gorgeous
and that was one of my wonderful childhood memories
yeah
yeah it it's bad lake erie when i haven't been home for several years but the last time i was home i was just so surprised to see how terrible lake erie was i mean it just was awful
and it just makes you so sad because at one time it was just a beautiful lake
and not too long ago really
but
it sure has
well thank you and you have many good fishing days too
bye night bye-bye
um-hum
uh-huh yeah
no huh-uh do you
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh

uh-huh
wow
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
uh-huh
oh sounds pretty
oh
um-hum
well good
well you know now we have that new mall in lewisville and that's just like a mile or two from our house
but when we first moved to coppell it's what six years ago we didn't even have a grocery store
and now we have four and coppell's not really big enough to support four grocery stores
oh much very much in fact it's about the size now i moved down here from chicago what twenty three years ago and to lewisville
and coppell's now about the size that lewisville was when i moved down here
uh-huh
what i what i do on my i keep up on current events by as i walk by the newspaper stand if there is a headline that grabs my attention then i will stand there and look at it for a minute then walk into my office
maybe once every six months i'll find something that's interesting enough that i'll buy the paper and then usually i end up reading a lot of it
no oh yeah i do i watch i watch star trek and sometimes i watch the equalizer i never watch the news
my roommates watch the news sometimes so sometimes i'll get
get interested in a news article so i guess a little bit leaks through there and sometimes on a on a plane or in a airport i'll be sitting some somewhere and there will be a newspaper next to me and i'll read parts of it
wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah we have a news station here that i listen to sometimes on the way to work but it's a short drive
uh-huh
um-hum
wow
in the gulf war
that i have to say that during the gulf war yeah i watched a lot of cnn
i really did because i was pretty interested in that and i have a an iranian roommate
and so he had on constantly
and so and actually i learned a lot from him about world situations and also i have a bunch of persian friends because of him and so
yeah and they are always telling me about countries i have never heard of and political situations that totally amaze me
and so
less content
they were kind of starved for real information i think at that point because all they had was military clips and
yeah well they have to show something
i never thought about that
the information per hour well technically the information on the tv is higher but the actual content is less
okay
well what do you think about gun control
yeah
i wouldn't be against control if it
made it virtually impossible for even criminals to get them
that's the problem is when you when you know you take it away from the people who don't intend to ever use them for a violent crime other than hunting and things like that
and the criminals can always continue to get the guns regardless they can get them through the black market or whatever so i'm not sure if gun control in it's true sense that they're trying to implement it will ever work
um-hum
yeah i think you know if it when it came down to these what i what i would consider militant type guns assault rifles and you know hand guns because i'm not i'm not a real advocate of hand guns i mean i do i do own one
but i own it for protection i know how to use it i know when not to use it
i think for the person that's inexperienced has no business with one
yeah
yeah
well the reason i say we were we personally have experienced a major crime in our family
and you know with my wife and daughter
they were kidnapped
and
you know and it's really made me look differently
at the way it is you know and i'm not saying that i if i'd had a gun i could have done you know anything because i really wasn't even there it happened while i was away but
but i think there are certain cases where it could get you in trouble you have to be able to know when it when it can and when it can't if it came in the middle of the night where if i could get my hands on it and do something with it that's one thing
that's all right
well i've kind of got pros and cons about both there there's good things and bad things and there's a lot of details that you know it's hard to work out all the details
yeah i assure you it can it can and the chances you know because we've been through a lot of the court battles and all this other stuff over the years because they're behind bars now but
but they won't be there long and we we've had to deal you know we've had to deal with a lot of that and
the frightening thing is and i can i can tell you from you know just statistics and from even other people i've talked with your chances is one is actually one in three right now
one out of every third person is has and i'm talking about a major crime committed against them now it's one out of every four or five for just a crime
whether it be just normal robbery or whatever
than a normal average six foot fence did you know that
yeah we thought because we had an eight foot fence
the problem is they can get behind it and they can do a lot behind an eight foot fence
that they can't do behind a normal fence
in fact they say it's actually it's you're actually more secure if you have no fence at all
but
yes
yes
yeah they well they didn't use them but they put they put the guns to their heads
yeah
and you know they physically were not harmed in any way they were very lucky
and knowing the guy and his record his normal motif is to kill them he just he just happened not to he put them in the trunk of her car and drove them out and left them
yeah he's just basically crazy he's been he's been in prisons you know a couple times
and yet he's out in a very little time
one he's one person but he's used them not maybe necessarily killed them but that's his normal style i mean that that's what he would do in a in a confronted situation
you know he's been it's been proven that he that he's not
society material
but yet you know he'll like i say he'll be back out on the street just because of this new you know
you know and those that they that they that clinically are nuts and out of their minds
or those who have committed a murder who are who will do it again because they've said you know when a person's murdered somebody out of cold blood the chances are they would do it again because they feel no remorse
they need and i and i and i hate to say this because i know it sounds awfully bad but they need to eliminate them
they need to get them out of society
we can't tolerate it anymore we don't we flat don't have the space we don't have the money
i mean i've heard of you know similar programs but to me i mean if
and i you know and again i hate to say this but had they had they really hurt my family
or whatever
i would have stopped at nothing to ensure they were dead
i and that and i hate to say that but i mean it's just you they violate your family of course at that point you don't have much to lose and i and like i said i really hate to say that but i think that i would be that taken buy it
yeah
but the victims are the ones that are the are made the criminals i mean they're the ones that end up hurting the worst
and that that's really a shame but as far you know but as far as gun control goes i think that there definitely needs to be some measures taken because not everybody's capable of owning and taking care of a weapon
and
yeah
you know it's hard to say that
well there's not enough policemen
no well there's not enough policeman
or detectives or whatever you know and the people have to learn to
to help themselves some they have by being extra careful
by you know by knowing the signs of a of a crime beginning to happen or whatever
yeah well i mean lot of people say well i don't want to get involved because then you know because then if you know if they get off then they are going to come after me you know you know there's a there's a lot of that well see to me i will never stand by
i won't
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
is that because they can't do anything with them or
um-hum
uh-huh
-thing like that
yeah we've actually got see there's several different bins at the work place and at home we've got
several different recycling things going on and
at home
we actually have a private sanitation company that asks us to separate out all of our stuff and they take everything from car you know engine oil
which is a hard one to get rid of
to you know plastic milk jugs and bottles and stuff like that so we have it all sort of separated out in bags by the time he comes around he comes around a couple times a week then we have there's a recycling center down at park not far from us
where if you really have big loads you can go in and separate it yourself so there's all you know all the different categories of stuff i don't know if they break it out in plastics between milk jugs and other things but i think it's like plastics glass paper
for a long time the guys who ran the company i work for we're kind of resistant to any kind of recycling because they felt like it was just going to cost them money or something
and so they put up
eventually you know there's enough pressure and they put up they put up a couple different bins one of them was for paper which everybody gets everybody gets a paper bin in their office
no you know no clips no staples you know and so it's kind of it's kind of a pain you have to get in that habit
and the other ones they have for aluminum cans they also have and this is sort of the funniest part they had a styrofoam recycling thing going on
and they were yeah they were actually in the staff meetings that we used to have there was this guy who's job it was to sort of track that and every month he would actually report how much money
of this company made on recycling and so he'd say you know and i'd like to report that we made twenty five dollars and two cents
which is a real pain you know because i mean not everybody wonders in with their coffee cup i mean a lot of us haven't been you know
yeah
yeah
so anyway so we have a lot of things lot of things going on i actually i'm a big i'm a big recycling fan i think it's pretty important actually hear about all these stories about
yeah
there there's actually a company out
straight west of us in strasburg virginia that makes arm rests for cars
in mass quantities in fact virtually every piece of trim that you see on the inside of your car japanese or american these guys make
and so it's a giant plastics i think they have a like a seventy five percent market share or something
i think they use a lot of recycled plastic but the funny thing about it is
is that they have because of
right
i usually have parties that are smaller groups i don't have i've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like thanksgiving and such
and so yeah i guess i usually do i like to cook heavy sauces and
noodles and pasta and such
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
humidity or something
um-hum
uh-huh
with all the cholesterol and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain
um-hum
oh no
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
oh that sounds good
really like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes
oh yeah
um-hum yeah
oh that's good
uh-huh
i think it's pretty good i think they should do it especially in companies where
you deal with either with other people or with stuff that
i want to say
everywhere you know when i was in college
when everywhere i applied a job for pretty much did a drug test because most of them were like defense contractors and stuff
except the last job the job i actually took
so
it's a big company it's mci telecommunications and i think they may require it for like the field engineers the people that actually go out you know and drive their trucks around and stuff like that or run the heavy machinery but they don't require it for you know the engineering positions
yeah i was kind of surprised but
defense contractors only want you doing it because they don't want you to sell drugs or buy drugs for you know for secrets or something you know
right
um-hum
um-hum
hum
right
um-hum
yeah i mean
yeah i mean i have i have no i mean people complain so much you know about random drug testing and infringing their rights and all this stuff
and you know i don't know i guess it's bad you know to go inside somebody you know hand them a urine sample bottle you know but
right
right
uh-huh
well i mean now even if you had a false positive i mean they're better you can have retests or what do they do test on your hair
they can
well can't they also test your hair
right
oh really
okay well you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
well they i mean all the places i went to you know they gave us you know small tests and stuff like that i guess if
you could always get a second opinion i mean if your company
tests positive
i mean i would just think there was a way there'd be a way around it if i mean even if you did test positive you could probably get tested again
and
test negative
and any way have time for that
yeah
um-hum
yeah and a matter of fact i think there are too many of these dull databases going around
yeah that's true i guess they put it in your personnel file
yeah because i i'm you know
i'm surprised they don't do it you know in my organization
but
right
uh-huh yeah
boat captains i mean not necessarily big boat captains
but small the small personal boats
they had trouble with not just substance abuse but alcohol abuse and stuff
and they had these boat crashes and you know all these people were getting arrested
and they finally said no more alcohol out there
you know in like where i used to live in virginia
they had a lot of problems with boat wrecks and involving you know alcohol related incidents and drug related incidents
so they finally just said if we catch you we're going to take away your license and take away your boat if we have to
straightened a few people out
um-hum well you know i'm the same way
um-hum
um-hum
okay i'm ready
uh-huh
do you have children
oh that's good
i have four girls they're nine and five and three and a newborn
yes
girls are nice aren't they
anyway as far as clothing goes
regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes
clothes that are in between where you're not down to regular size yet
kind of the same stuff all the time though i don't get a whole lot new right now
yeah
yeah i like jeans a lot
oh and it's frustrating i just i find i have to get the right kinds though or it's not comfortable
they it works best if they have pleats in the front
but i when i was i was pregnant through the summer this time and i wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist
but
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh i haven't tried those
huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh
i remember that from when i was i worked way before i was
you've got to have something to add to it or something i don't know if you can
you burn up yeah
yeah
it's hard on the car
oh
yeah
oh that's funny
yeah
at least something cooler
that's true
yeah i don't have to worry a whole lot about that
i've always been a creature of comfort too if it's not comfortable forget it
wool was never comfortable to me
yeah
yeah
what do you think can be done about that
yeah
yeah
i agree
i've got a friend who's a very talented teacher and has given it up
in carrollton just because it's not i mean she just can't stand the paper work
you know it's
and she's not paid enough she gets more as a filing claims for an insurance company which she's not even trained to do
so
i think it's real discouraging
yeah
i don't either
well do you have children
out of the dallas school district
yeah
i don't have any but if i did i don't know that i could i would want them to be in a dallas school district
yeah
how old is your daughter
where are you speaking from i can hear a lot of background noise
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
and demanded the children right
uh-huh
hm
well that goes along with football though too you know
hi
well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants shrubbery that were guaranteed and we had no problem with it we got our got our money back
well
i believe they're better
i think so i don't think that shoddy not as shoddy electrical appliances i think are pretty good reliable
oh did you return it
no
uh-huh
oh
no huh-uh did they replace it
i haven't bought any new well
the last thing i bought was a dress last summer
i think it is too and it was an expensive dress
yes it was
half of it raveled out
and that was i believe a leslie faye dress and it was
yep i don't usually but i did that one
okay i think so
well we'll be talking to you later bye-bye
i bought a taurus
the thing i want always wanted a car with a big trunk so i can carry a lot of stuff that's one of the prime considerations
i want something that's reasonably reliable and something that's not likely to get expensively damaged in a small crash and you can't get all three today you got to give up one or the other
um-hum yeah the fuel economy is not a big factor especially with the way that gasoline prices now are below what they were in nineteen eighty of course they were pretty outrageous then but
yeah in real dollars it's just not much of a factor you know the
well i that's that would be that would be reasonable i think i'm wondering about the economic justification for taxing gasoline some more you say well it's a nonrenewable resource
but i don't know there's lots of -renewable resources that one could tax just because they're nonrenewable including everything you mine out of the ground
i don't know if there really is that justification but it certainly is more palatable to have them tax gasoline and use it to
build roads than it is to have them take tolls which means you got to stop and means that
excuse me
yeah but there's nobody that checks you see we could actually talk about anything but if you i mean bring us back to the topic if you'd like
um-hum
um-hum
hm so what would you get you know what are the what are the epa fuel economy numbers
hm
yeah that's pretty good now i don't know how big the car is i mean does it have a big trunk that's sort of the bottom line
yeah
someday and you know if you have kids then you're gonna want to have room for passengers and
no i just i'm i just
well you can't drive it any faster than the other cars anyway it's not allowed you know
and most sports cars don't have room for anything in them that's not my kind of vehicle
well i maybe i don't know about a van the thing i hate i hate it when i'm behind vans but being in one would be the opposite effect you could see over everything that would be helpful
so many times you get behind somebody and you wonder what's up ahead and if that person stops then you might have a hard time stopping
so or you or you just can't see around it like somebody could come in from an intersection you couldn't see it because the van blocks your field of view but
no i got a regular car but you know four door sedan
yep um-hum
oh no not the one for the trunk i didn't get that one that would have been good but
i
oh yeah you could do that right i thought it was that but it just doesn't work i mean there just is it would it would be it would be it would be nice if i could do that i agree
is that well let's put it this way the user manual doesn't say anything about it now i don't know it's maybe it's an
this one is so much longer than any other one that i that i that i ever saw that i didn't even think about writing it reading now when i was a little kid and my parents got new cars then i would always read the manual
but
yeah
that story was different
yeah
oh you haven't
yeah
yeah
but the problem is that i am very liberal politically and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for
liberal politically i'm you know like pretty left wing democrat so
oh you don't
well it used to be it's kind of hard to say now especially after desert storm but i think back in the times when my political opinions were being formed like in during the vietnam war and stuff
the republicans were more
you know what they called hawks which is more like aggressive in war and more pro-war and pro-aggression and
the democrats were the doves they were more for peace and i'm not sure how much that holds true anymore i think you know the issues are
yeah and democrats usually are more supportive of public assistance programs and programs to
the big republican thing is that they don't they vote for less government they want less government involvement in society and so they're more less apt to vote in you know more aid to people or more
they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government
running things
so have you ever voted at all
you haven't
how old are you
well
uh-huh
yep
yeah well
uh-huh
uh-huh
no it was dukakis
from massachusetts
oh yeah that was yeah ferraro that was a while ago that was a couple elections ago yeah
um-hum
so what do you think about
what do you think about what you see on tv about them like in the news or on the ads do you kind of just
you don't
uh-huh
um-hum
you didn't get any government classes
yeah it's really hard too because before they used to have
or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues
um-hum
um-hum yeah they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and
things like that so that's kind of how i judge there's a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control or let me see i try to look at
and but you get you know it all depends again on whose writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too
um-hum yeah
so
well that's okay
do you think
do you think i mean what would it take like that this is really good actually for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted i mean what kind of
how would it how what kind of stuff would they would you like them to do so that you would know more about it like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library or
um-hum
um-hum
or do you just not do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote or
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
but a lot of families do that i know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote
but
well
um-hum
hart
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum yeah
um-hum
you know and i that's very true i think that doesn't really have that much to do with unless they've done something really horrible you know or something real abnormal
yeah right but otherwise
um-hum
yeah
that's right
i think that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country's being run is that the election
you know the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no and if they don't say yes or no then
maybe somebody'll vote for them that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side do you know what i'm saying so they just try and make it a personal thing i mean if you remember
any of the tv commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had pictures of bush with his grandchildren walking around with his grandchildren and
i just thought he was really inept i don't think he did anything at all he they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were
well i think that was part of it i think there's a lot of the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the recession and stuff people just had a picture of carter as not being real capable
but he actually all right this
did you i always liked him i thought he was great at the time and i just couldn't get over the fact that reagan beat him i you know that i just couldn't believe that he got voted out
um-hum yeah
yeah
you did have you heard stuff about him lately do you know what he's doing
well he is just he is really active still politically he's been overseas you remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the middle for
yes i have a very large family i have seven brothers and sisters
and being next to the youngest we all almost all are married and all have children so it's quite a feat to get everyone together but
we went out to dinner of course and we had cake and champagne and then we went back to his house and we reenacted some of the things we remembered him doing when he was when we were little
you know like we always had to take off his shoes and socks so you know one of us did that and
and he used to tease us about he would he was gonna clean his shotgun when out on the front porch when we were gonna go out on dates or
he was gonna threaten to kill the easter bunny or santa claus you know
and so one of us dressed up and got the old shotgun and you know course it was empty nobody uses it but brought that upstairs and
and so it was really funny he really enjoyed it and all the rest of us did too because we spent a couple hours talking about it afterwards and adding more things we'd forgotten so
was
and how about you
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh boy
oh
i think it's wonderful you get together once a year
that doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial
well i think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence
need to be reevaluated i think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all crimes against children is one of them
yeah
um-hum
actually i would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in middle eastern countries if you steal you lose a hand
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
deciding what that proper punishment is one thing i think that there should be no way
i realize that innocent people could go to what is it lethal injection now
innocent people could do that but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum to maintain a prison that's right that's stupid
um-hum that's right
um-hum
um-hum
sure
well i don't have solutions to the problems but you know you have these this would be nice if and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory but i think that if you
did something for example to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living i remember a man drove by
randomly shot a women in the head while she was driving blinded her
i think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate i think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual
or the family of an individual
who has been harmed you're you know
people who kill policemen who are killed in the line of duty they may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman but that family still has no provider
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
um-hum
i don't i don't agree with the length of the sentence though i think expediency is the answer
um-hum
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's right technical i think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals
you can appeal it once
i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is if it is contradictory
yeah that's right uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
that's right well one of the sad things is that so many of these
never actually come to trial because of
of the process in which the criminals were apprehended
i mean you know the guy is guilty you know he's done what he's done you may have stood there and seen it but because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested
you know he goes free uh-huh yeah
right and i realize that is designed to protect the innocent it's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers and i
yeah
absolutely that's why you check books out from the library but i really believe that
our justice system is the best around but it's not perfect and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact
that's right
that's right
um-hum
that's right
that's right and it i don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter
and that just that really does ruffle my feathers at times i mean i can just get so aggravated about it
but
yes we have a house with a big backyard for the kids to play in and a pretty good size front yard
my husband it's not a job that i enjoy at all
so you don't have to fool with any of that anymore
well i'm big into the plant i like the flower beds and plants a lot better than i do the lawn
so
yeah i had used to have a garden until the kids got older and we don't have any more room in the backyard so now all i've got is flowers instead of vegetables
hum
um-hum
yeah it's nice to have nothing is better than going out there and picking your own tomatoes or different vegetables and things to eat
um-hum
um-hum
yeah container gardening is really pretty easy because i've done some of it before
you just need to get the you need to get the right mix of soil so that it doesn't dry out
and so that your plants because and then you have to you still have to water them a lot of times
once a here in dallas you have to water sometimes twice a day because it gets so hot in the summer
well we've got a beautiful day and there are people out everywhere all of our neighbors are out scalping their lawn for the first time
yes we hit our we'll hit our last spring freeze
it snowed here as late as may before but that was really unusual our last freeze is usually about april fifteenth
and so we're all everybody's out planting and buying and
seeing what died
um-hum
yeah it makes it nice for gardening when it's when it's like that because we can grow a lot of things
even through the winter that y'all can't grow we can start i can start a garden in july i've done that and plant some of the
sturdier crops broccoli and things like that you have to really water it a lot when it's when it's young like that and it's in the heat but then
then as the fall comes on you get a you can get a really beautiful second crop
of a lot of the cooler weather vegetables and sometimes that's the only some peas and different things like that that's the only time of the year you can grow them
because otherwise it's too it gets if you start them when it's cooler in the spring then it gets too hot in the summer
um-hum
yeah
yeah but it gets a lot colder up there a lot quicker because we can grow sometimes there have been times when i've grown stuff out i've grown broccoli up and through november
and still have it producing and okra will grow real okra will grow to be six foot tall it's just
yeah you probably don't have the right temperatures and stuff probably not too many people eat it up there either it seems to be kind of a southern delicacy
um-hum
yeah
yeah
maybe so
um-hum
oh well what's your favorite plant if you were you know you were talking about your containers maybe you were going to get those started what would you like to put in them
um-hum
yeah tulips is just kind of late because you have to you have to force them
if you were going to do that you might put some strawberries in there around the edges
um-hum
yeah they'll work that way and they're kind of pretty they've got little white flowers and
long as you
no
they'd grow kind of like a vine they put out little feelers kind of like an ivy would
and along those is that's where the strawberry grows and it will eventually take over an area you plant them when you plant strawberries you plant them like
six to eight inches or more you can even plant further than that but to cover an area so you put them eight inches apart all through a flower bed
and by the next year you'll have pretty much a solid bed of strawberries
they're real simple that's why i like them i just put a bunch out because you just put them out there and you water them
the bugs don't least at least here the bugs don't particularly bother them
and they don't require a lot of fertilizing or care you know during the rest of the year
yeah and then about every five years you have to dig them up and throw them away and start over again they don't last forever
it that can help but you just get to a point where they're just not productive anymore
it's just a kind of just the way the plant is
yeah
yeah i like tomatoes but i always end up with when i've grown them i end up with the little cherry tomatoes
just thousands of them and i can't figure out what to do with them all
the same kind of thing
yeah
yeah
yeah some other things that'll grow good in those containers and you can you can mix and match the flowers with your vegetables and grow around them marigolds and impatiens
they do real good especially impatiens because you tend to get shade when you're on a porch area part of the time
all back and forth and around yeah because they're going be they'll grow now from now until the about
middle of june then i'll have all the onions and they'll be out and then i'll put in some flowers
some annuals for the rest of the year and some color
it's just too hot and it has to be done too often
yeah
yeah with ours it wouldn't be so bad we had a self propelled mower but the self propelled part broke
and so it doesn't and then and then it weighs a ton
because it's
yeah and it's so it's supposed to pull itself along and my husband it doesn't bother him and i'm got out and mowed for him one day just to be nice so he wouldn't have to do it when he got home
and i said what is with this mower i can't even push it around the yard
and you know he's like well i get more exercise pushing it around
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
too many trips around the yard with that thing huh for sure
oh gosh
oh yeah
that's the other thing with my husband he gets
he he's one of these people he didn't care about the flower beds and stuff i guess we divide it pretty well that way but he gets real picky about the grass he wants to get out there and he cuts it on diagonal
and goes all this back and forth and you know and gets the weed eater out and trims all the little bits around the flower beds and all the little bits around the trees that he didn't get
he'll go out there and spend four hours on the lawn
i guess
no nobody's going to bother you
yes i have one chihuahua that's fourteen years old
do you
oh uh-huh
there's been a time when we had as many as like four pets when our children were growing up and everything you know but they died off one by one and that's it
yeah cause they're just they are kind of like a baby you know they're they
so she lived a long time
well kind of both
she had always been almost an entirely outdoor cat except we have a little door you know where she could come in
but then as she got real old then she went out less and less and then not at all you know the last year or so
so
now what do your cats look like
uh-huh
oh you have to have his skin i mean his
oh
oh
oh my goodness
oh yeah i don't think i have ever seen a cat sheared like that
oh my i bet
oh now we do a lot we our daughters are like in their late twenties and one of them has a shelty
and
so any time she is traveling or she is working a lot or whatever all kinds of reasons
and its a very pretty dog you know looks like a little miniature collie
but it is a real pretty little dog but i don't know if all of them are that way or not its a real shy dog it really only likes my daughter and us you know
and
yeah well yeah now cats it is more usual i think to do that i don't think i have ever known a dog that would this i mean she is so shy that my daughter's roommate
or what roommates she has had and all if the dog comes out and sees it is not my daughter she goes back under the bed she won't even come out for anybody else that's why we have to keep her so much because she won't come out for anybody else
yeah they don't
i mean they know each other and all that but they i mean they don't play or anything because my chihuahua is older she doesn't care any thing about playing and we have promised her that
because every when we got her she was like one of four pets
right we had a
yeah well of course this one's
oh yeah trying to make a long story short we stopped at a service station several months ago and then when we got home i said well you get the dog i will get the baby i had the grandchild in the backseat
no dog
the dog had hopped out at the service station to go to the bathroom and we didn't know it until we got home and i mean you talk about somebody being frantic and upset and
and it took us three days of walking that little town and talking to everybody and handing out posters and with pictures of the dog
well somebody looked at the picture on the poster well not poster i made you know xerox copies looked at the picture and said i saw that dog sunday and he directed me to who
okay
well let's see
right we don't get that in straight fashion but you know the other major channels have been carrying a lot of it so i've seen a good bit of their coverage
uh-huh
uh-huh
well our newspaper does a pretty good job on most things but you know its not totally in depth and quite frankly i didn't read all of the war stuff
you know it was just there were too many long article and i try to quickly read through the paper before work in the morning so i don't get to spend a lot of time on everything
uh-huh
what about your radio stations do they provide much in the way of current event stuff
uh-huh well i've lived in a small town before and was quite aware of the local radio station at that time and i know how they are
well ours that we
tend to listen to most i like the way they handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they'll have you know five minutes worth of news every half hour
but in the middle of the day they don't just drown you with the same old stuff and they won't interrupt unless it's you know really important
and of course they did a good bit for some of the war stuff but they didn't just over do it
yeah
i think so i don't really think we
need to know or even sometimes care so much about all the little nitty-gritty things they keep asking over and over i think the reporters sometimes ask the silliest questions
and there seems to be no purpose you know the person has stated you know some opinion or fact or whatever and that should be the end of it and they just keep on and on and on
uh-huh
yeah
well you too
oh well we're having sunshine i think it's gonna be up in the seventies today so
no i have two children i have a two year old and a three and a half year old
really that's wild
oh boy well mine was two in march and the three and a half year old will be four in july
so that is pretty close
but i'm home with the kids all day and i have really
tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us
but
pretty much pretty much i work part-time but my husband's able you know mostly to take care of them when i'm working so but we adopted these two little guys and that was another reason why i really wanted to be here because you know they have had a
couple foster homes already
the baby was eleven weeks old and his brother was twenty two months
yeah so
um-hum
yeah
yeah
oh boy
yeah
oh that's mean
yeah
yeah
that's the hardest thing i think you know to deal with is that people love your kids i put
my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and you know that kind of thing and he was in there for three months when i pulled him out
and the teacher had eleven kids it was excellent supposedly the reputation was fantastic for this place was supposed to be an excellent school and i had several friends who had recommended it too but it really gets down to the particular teacher
and she was a new teacher at the school and she had eleven you know three year olds in a room and i just think it was way too much they were almost all boys
pardon
i didn't think much i don't think much
yeah and she was just my three year old is real active and she just kept saying how wild he was well you know there was kind of a connotation there of him being
there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more and it's really hard to you can't control eleven three year olds with one person you know yeah you know
so i just finally took him out plus financial reasons it was expensive but i was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time but i still felt like even after all the checking i did
you know you really can't know everything about what's going to happen i felt safe that
the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them you know because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms and i felt like
that was a big factor for me that they would be safe you know from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh gosh
so you had to come home and clean before you could even do anything probably
oh gosh
yeah
oh yeah i was i took the kids there once just to try it they had a free day at kindercare yeah
uh-hum
and the other one was that the younger one got bit
really badly by another child and what they did was they took my
younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day
instead of taking the kid that was biting out and do something with him yeah
yeah
yeah
so you feel like your values aren't getting yeah
yeah god loves you know basic things like that
yeah
um-hum
yeah
wow
oh what luck
really
oh that's great
yeah
oh really wow
that's okay i got the dryer going in the background so
yeah
oh that's great
yeah
yeah
yeah
really because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because i can't do anything with them here i can't even go grocery shopping right now with the two of them because the baby is so
yeah i need to even just for a couple days a mornings a week or something to have something like that so i think i'm going to look for that remind me of that now that you mention it i was been meaning to do that you know
because some of the churches do have them you know for like six dollars per child and that's not that big a deal you know for a couple times
yeah
yeah
yep
sounds good yeah
well thanks did we cover everything we need
okay
okay
yeah okay well great well thanks a lot you have a good day bye-bye
i find that my main source of information on current events is conversations with other people i often find myself going oh is that right i didn't realize that it happened yesterday
no not on a regular basis
yeah i have frequently decided just that i would just go ahead and read a paper every day but i haven't really
i just don't watch much television i'm usually i usually don't get home -til after the evening news is over and i'm usually in bed by the time the late news starts
but i do watch some tv and sometimes there'll be if it's some big news with like with the primaries and things like that they would run little banners across the bottom of the tv screen
i worked with a guy who was in the
who had just gotten out of the army and he told me he kept me up to date on what was going on
how do you keep up on current events
do you feel like you keep up sufficiently i mean are you as caught up with it as you'd like to be
right
right i guess i'd have to agree with you i hadn't really though of that but i certainly
seems
right
is that what you do
read your newspaper over breakfast and
well yeah
do you listen to the radio much
yeah
yeah i get i get a little bit of news from the radio just they'll have hourly updates on
some news caps
uh-huh
right
i would think even the traffic i think of the traffic updates as news also just because
there i guess they qualify as a current event
right
i would think that would be probably on a i guess as a percentage of the population that would keep up with something i bet the traffic conditions is probably number one
oh
hello
hello
yes my name is carolyn
okay i'll just let you start
i think they are too and unfortunately
we use ours in we don't use them all the time but we use them like at christmas time and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them
i think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them
that's what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think
when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year you could really
if you were just able to pay outright for it
that's right
yeah all i know is some of my credit cards like
we have a sears one and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and it's just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card well that's
probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on
at that point and then it seems like
um-hum
wow
it sure is
we eventually did one time we just borrowed you know took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards
we haven't done it lately we probably need to do it again
um-hum
um-hum
oh no
um-hum
i know they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car
um-hum
you know one thing you might do with in a situation like that though it's just like keep
hi
yeah
no unfortunately my husband and i are both only children now we do have like some cousins that are we're kind of close to and sometimes we see the cousins' children
as a matter of fact we were going to ask his one cousin to try to make plans to have her kids come maybe visit this way for a few days and of course you know
things sometime you get to be the tourist folks and we will take them to six flags take them to wet n wild i mean they may not be real quality time but
yeah it will be a real treat for them you know to kind of come and do that because they live in east texas so they will be something real out of the norm
and i used to spend a lot of time with her and her kids we used to go to the pool all the time it was an apartment complex so we used to the pool and
you know just kind of play around and do water games and you know have picnics out there that kind of stuff that was our normal thing we also
get some movies that are enjoyable for the kids and not always a strict disney thing you know when you get eleven and nine year olds they want something a little more active than a cartoon
milo and otis what is that with the animals like the dogs
that sounds cute well we had one silly movie that we used to watch a lot because
they were kind of expensive when she got that player we did not have too many movies we used to watch airplane over and over and over again i mean have you ever seen that movie
it's real silly
there her kids i remember one summer cried all summer long they wanted to go to six flags
they wouldn't get on any of the rides even if they were you know tall enough they did not want to get on any rides
and they cried all summer long when are you going to take us to six flags i want to go to six flags you know they kind of chickened out
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum
uh-huh
well you know one thing that you know i kind of say we have only been married a couple of years but
you know i think so many times in the past you know like even forty fifty years ago i mean it was just expected or kind of pushed upon people you get married and you have kids
whether or not there was something that inside you really wanted to do
and i like it now that people make the decision you know okay i am going to be married
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i mean you hear people well there are some people that marry later and then they are very set in their ways and there are activities that they do and well i really do not want to make that sacrifice i have
or i came from a family that i had a very bad childhood and i do not know that right now
i could have children and cope with it i have too many bad feelings with my own childhood and maybe i will turn out to be you know abusive like my mother was
so they say you know i do not feel that i want to do that which is fine you know i think that's a wonderful decision on their part if that's how they truly feel
it's none of your business
it's my option to do that you know you do not just have ten kids because you know you are supposed to somehow as of the old days
yeah my mom was from a family of ten and she was the youngest and her dad was like sixty when she was born and she said you know so there was hardly anything from her father
there was like twenty years between her father and her mother her father was sixty and her mother was forty
you know i think that i have kind of done the right thing i mean i have i was just really shocked to have a cousin who is a bit younger than i and she was one of these types out of high school you know
i'm against capital punishment
i guess there's a cliche that
for every thousand criminals let free if one innocent person is killed that that's a terrible thing for the state to be doing and i agree i remember watching a documentary film a couple of years ago
i've forgotten the name of it now but it was about a killing in texas where somebody was sentenced i think it may have been just to life imprisonment but in any event it may have been capital punishment but
no i don't think so it was a i don't remember the circumstances actually i just remember
no this was documentary
um-hum
and there's also the factor that
that there's obviously racism in terms of even though certain minorities might commit a higher percentage of crimes than they are represented in the overall population they are also convicted of capital crimes
and sentenced to capital punishment at a higher percentage than they're represented even among criminals so that's
oh really
um-hum
um-hum
right
i think
i don't know
um-hum i think some bar associations a lot of bar associations are against capital punishment and this is one area where perhaps they've done some of the work i'm not sure
right
um-hum
is that so
i'm not sure i think
right
right
right i was living in illinois before here and i'm virtually certain that they didn't have it or if they did have it was never used
okay i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is like the room for advancement
you know not to get in like in a dead end job
and plus
for me it's i mean like medical and you know benefits and dental
they're also important
are they like pretty much trained for a specific job and that what's their hired for and then
just very little variation from there
um-hum
um-hum
well you know that's kind of interesting though because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore i use to think that you know after you worth
you mean security job security
that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i don't know
if it is so much anymore in fact they we just had a lay off in what november i guess
but it wasn't necessarily i mean you know some people had been there a long time
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum and there's no doubt yeah
yeah that's exactly it yeah where the most dollar what it where it you know cuts back the most
oh
oh see yeah
yeah i think that's one of the things too you get too many management people you know
yeah and it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know
and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time when those people aren't there anymore
yeah
um-hum
yeah but so what else do you think is important
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i think probably in a smaller yeah i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing you probably have a better team
cooperation or team playing atmosphere
probably where as in a bigger corporation sometimes i you think you're just a number you know
um-hum
um-hum
whereas yeah in a smaller i think you'd be more willing to either help that person or help it
get accomplished you know
um-hum
i guess i am probably closer to a ten than a one i am i am not opposed at all to having a waiting period for you know for the purchase of guns
firearms for you know for their whatever their own purposes are as long as they are legal purposes
and i am opposed to anything that would limit what the constitution allows
yeah i agree with that although i can i can see where there might be even be a potential sometime you know a need sometime in the future for the individuals to have
even machine guns available you know if we were ever invaded of course now that is pretty far fetched but if the united states were ever invaded i think that the
man on the street is going have to be the one to defend the country at some point or might have to at some point
and i think that there should be sufficient
guns and you know and ammunition and things available for that
right
yeah well i always wondered you know why he was so adamant about you know about being opposed to that waiting period
you know even before i mean you know i did not see that the waiting period was a you know it was a major restriction
um-hum
right
criminal or somebody with criminal intent real criminal intent wants a gun they are going to get one
the drug dealer is not going to you know he's not going to wait the seven days for a gun anyway
the people that are trying to be
law abiding people are the ones that are going to wind up
being able to get the guns legally
you know even with the waiting period and i you know i cannot see that there is anybody that does not have criminal intent that would have any reason to object to that waiting period that is
yeah whitman
um-hum
right well you know hinckley was the one that took the shot at reagan and he bought his gun at a pawn shop here in dallas i think or somewhere in the dallas area
and you know if he'd had to have a waiting period he didn't stay in dallas long enough
at that time to have waited the seven days
so if there'd been a waiting period he wouldn't have had the gun
or a least he wouldn't have had that gun he might've had another one
but
you know so i you know i can see that there are
are reasons for having a waiting period that i think that anybody that
you know anybody that does not have a criminal background or you know any real reason to not allow them to have one i think that anybody that wants one should be able to buy one
that's interesting because i don't own one though i don't own a gun but that's you know that's my personal opinion anyway
right
right
right you know they rifles and shotguns for you know for like you say for deer hunting and for bird hunting are you know that is
yeah i believe it was yeah
there was a deal on television just i saw it yesterday or the day before where there was an oriental shopkeeper in california i think it was in san bernardino california
that there were five young guys they were gang members that came in to rob his store
and they all had guns and he had a gun somewhere under the counter that he got and he shot all five of those killed two of them
but you know he was really blazing away
and i think he got shot twice himself and but he was okay you know it was just he was injured but not seriously apparently
and you know i think that's you know that is the intent of the constitution is to of that part of the constitution is to allow people to defend themselves and their property
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
right
um-hum i had i had not heard about him robbing the safeway
but then there is also there is the what is his name bernie getz
you know of course he was his the purpose of him having the gun was to defend himself because he apparently he had felt threatened you know on the on the subway before
but i am not sure that
the private citizen carrying a gun
is
you know just the routine private citizen carrying a gun
is necessary to
i mean if you are not if you are not in a position where you have to defend yourself you know
in a routine basis then
perhaps carrying a gun on your person is not
is not all that advisable
i know that they are talking about here you know here in texas about having a new gun law that would allow certain individuals to be licensed to carry a gun
and
i think they ought take a long a good long hard look at who is allowed to carry a gun in those you know in those situations
um-hum
right
right
you know i guess that
i do not really know i guess there is not really a you know a lot to say from my point of view except that
you know the constitution says what kind of rights we have and i do not i really do not see the point
the space program seems to have run into a little bit of a snag funding wise anyway they've decided the space station's not may not be worth it and they're going to fight over that for a few years it seems
and just the idea of flight the shuttle system and what they thought they could do and what they're ending up doing and
the complexity and the seeming number of errors and breakdowns and problems they're having with it may not be
common thing all too soon and even if they ever do get it common or get it to where you know the a large percentage or even a
a one to two percent of a given nation ends up in space for some reason or another
they haven't solved and i don't know if they can solve the problem that weightlessness has extended weightlessness has on the human body i mean
we can do all we want as far as technology goes but if a human can't stand to be up there then what good does is it to have the station that for extended stays if you can't stand an extended stay
so i don't know if all the monies that are being spent on it
really should be spent with the idea of or with the goal of the space station or of claiming a sector of space or having defense out in space
i don't mind spending the money from the standpoint of basically government funded research and development and you know it's tends to create jobs our economy
tends to be based on a lot of a lot of that lately of course it really wreaks havoc with the economy when the government decides to shut down things like bases and
so what do you think about the whole space program as it were
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
right
you know you really don't want the economy to or the space program to become a too large percentage of the economy
so that when something some catastrophe does occur and it does have to be curtailed you don't gut the economy sort of like the defense industry problem has occurred as needs changed in the defense world then
you go and cut back on your spending and it cripples whole sections of the nation as it were with the lack of jobs and lack of whatever else
you do that with the space program and now as complex and as many different directions as they're being tugged with technology they want to be so big that if we ever did allow that
we're liable to be in the same boat and once these contracts are finished or if the space
pra platform disintegrated for whatever reason maybe there'd be that many thousands of jobs that were supplying prats you know parts to that weren't there anymore you'd have to go back to the jobs that needed to
be there when that was being created instead of being sustained and you know you can't have a quarter of the economy resting on one little project up there
so it gets kind of complicated when you start getting that big plus you get so many different directions
not being limited by technology here in the us but being limited by the whims of changing funding
it needs even that much more or better management from the nasa people to keep a clear goal and a relatively a reasonable one in sight as it were
so i don't know it's a it's a complex issue but
um-hum
well they keep talking about the space station the biggest thing they want to do up there is test out different manufacturing techniques in weightlessness but are these i never could quite figure out whether these techniques were something that could be done
simulated or we learn enough about it to do it down here on earth or are we talking about having to build some sort of a station that is going to produce these products and how much could you really produce in a lab up there
i don't i don't really guess i understand what they're going to do unless they're going to turn out product from that
well do you go camping glen
by camping
you mean really roughing it
oh but that was
well i've our children were growing up also we had a boat and we'd
go camping on the long weekends memorial day fourth of july labor day
and we went with some good friends and we'd get as many you know involved as we could and
so our kids really grew up all through you might say junior high and high school camping and
we've really had a good time doing it we went to a lake called lake tawakoni it's just kind of east and south of here in texas
and
we camped outside one time we had a tornado come through our campgrounds it was kind of interesting we had snakes and armadillos and
all the fun things that make memories
a bear oh
oh
uh-huh
didn't mind you being there a bit huh
oh
first time huh well
maybe you'll get a chance to go again
take them well we kind of gave up camping about three four years ago to and we built a lake house
and so now all our outdoor activities are centered around the lake house
well
we're still outside but we figured we're getting a little too old to rough it as much as we used to
i didn't know they did yeah
oh
i guess you know there's probably not any part of the country that doesn't experience them every once in a while
i bet yellowstone was a neat place to camp in we went up we pulled a trailer out there from illinois
when probably about nineteen seventy four i'm no it was before that it was must have been nineteen seventy two before we moved to texas
and we had like a sixteen foot trailer that we pulled behind the car
and all the kids and the dog and everything and actually i think i liked the camping with the tent better than pulling the trailer
but we made it out to yellowstone and it was gorgeous never forget that
yeah it
yeah
yeah that's true i don't know we live
well i'm close to salt lake and there's mountains you know all around but sometimes i think tend to hold a little bit of it in you know really it's fairly clean
i think it's a fairly clean city compared to some but you have quite
yeah i think sometimes it seems to be but
but anyway i don't know i know there's a lot of plants here when i drive down you know along the just along the freeway there's a lot of plants that they're burning things and
oh uh-huh
yeah we have a real fog problem the last few years just in through december and january it really it is foggy and seems to just
jeez i don't i don't know what else i know cars
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah that's what i see burning a lot and i'm not exactly sure what they're burning i know uh-huh there's some oil companies and i'm sure that contributes a lot just the burning of the
oh i don't know i haven't i haven't heard that i know i don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything but i know i think they differ from state to state
but you know that's been a new thing in the last few years and i guess some cars are a lot worse than others i think those
huh
oh
oh well do you are you working for t i
oh
oh uh-huh and that's how you got involved yeah no we have my husband's sister lives in dallas actually and they kind of got it us involved that way
yeah i've got speaking of noise you can probably hear my little
yes he's he is quite noisy yes jeez i don't know i know that
the dump that is you know closest to us there's some houses around there and i know that on windy days you know they're always moving the trash over to different spots and they've got those big bulldozers and you can see the dust
flying and i'm sure that their homes are really quite dusty and
oh is there
worried about the their kids getting huh
um-hum
oh we just barely did that too
yes
oh yes we have brick on the outside and it the colors that were there changed the and the colors we painted changed the entire look of the house completely
yes it was really exciting it was fun
um-hum well the other thing that we did was the roof of our house and we did that a different color also of course
being a woman most of these things were done by the men and so i wasn't directly involved but
they really were helpful i know to our house
yes
that's right
well as a matter of fact one thing i have a young son and one thing we did was we had paneling on the inside of our front of our house or the hallway of our house rather
and we were repainting the front room in the hall there and we took down that paneling and he helped me and he was it was fun to work with him
and help putty up the holes together and do things like that he was a
oh i like it so much better it makes it so much lighter you know it really
you know and people who have been to my house before and then now really have liked it much better too so it's been fun
yeah exactly
hm that's interesting
yeah
oh i bet it
well okay you too bye-bye
yes i do full time
no i don't have any children
no huh-uh
um-hum
oh my gosh
uh-huh
do you think it's gotten easier on you personally you know as far as
at work
you know other people how you interact it's gotten easier on you
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
right
yeah right yeah i'm an engineer
i found it to be a man's world and i got a lot of static from that
and it my first few years at ti i found it to really be hard
but now that i've been there for a while it's kind of a deal you have to prove yourself
and after i've been there for a while now you know the guys i'm just kind of one of the guys i'm you know respected and i do the same things they do
i'm not necessarily sure i get the pay the same pay but i'm pretty sure i do and
and i feel a lot better about it i have a friend that had just turned forty five
that's an engineer and she tells me horror stories
of what it use to be like you know you know always getting
belligerent comments like you ought to be at home having babies instead of doing these blueprints and things like that things that would just make her cry at work
but she couldn't cry in front of them because they'd do it more
you know so she's
she you know builds me up and says be a strong woman and present yourself professionally and
you know builds my confidence quite a bit
so that's why i ask you that if you thought maybe times his changed made it easier on you at work
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
that is so strange
yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
this little young girl yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
well let me ask you this how have did children do you feel like children set you back or kind of went off track a little while
you know this is this is an issue i'm on a women's subcommittee and women's initiative subcommittee and we were discussing this last week matter of fact
that certain women have taken career kind of jobs
and they didn't see that as a setback but
uh-huh
in other words if you wouldn't of had
oh yeah that's what they were saying before they had children they were working like crazy people
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah
uh-huh right
uh-huh i'd be okay
yeah
yeah
right
and a fear
um-hum
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
yeah i hear that there's all men in my group i'm
these men a lot of them have small children either just one or two you know babies because we're all fairly young and
and i hear the men saying that a lot
you know and i think that is a culture change that you know their lives have changed since they had children
so and they have the same concerns as not necessary an abuse
guilt but you know thinking well you know if i could spend more time then they could learn so much more
you know
yeah
um-hum right
right
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that's right their nannies and you know right day cares that's really interesting
yeah i was going to say if when i get to that point i'm sure i'll know it i see it from day-to-day like i say the men are experiencing this
you know a lot of them one of them just had a child within the last year and he has totally changed
and he routinely calls the day care during the day
you know like can i talk to my daughter you know and
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
that'll
that'll be me too and my family they'll go oh my god you've got children are you fixing to have a child they won't believe it they'll pass
well i just think the way that things are going that it would be good for young people to go ahead and have dedicate themselves to at least something
i know like the mormon religion you know they require two years of service missionary service right the boys
yeah and so but i think it would be good if for all young people you know to be able to do something like that so that you know
i don't know i just feel it would be good for them to do that
yeah
um-hum
oh sure
oh yeah and even in even in our home towns there's a lot of public service things that they could do
you know drug rehabilitation and alcohol and just helping old people and
you know helping cripple just helping somebody else and i think that art of giving is something that we don't have very much any more
oh i think they just gave it a title but it's not something that's in legislation or in works yeah no it's not it's just a just a topic but
i think so too i think so too because there's so many kids who have you know so much money and so much free time and nothing to do and nothing to give their time to
they don't even have a direction to give their time to so i think it would be really good for people to be able to give their time in some kind of public service even in our government
you know as aids to you know congress people
so yeah it would be it'd be really good i think
uh-huh right
oh yeah oh yeah i agree with you yeah this is something that like you say it's character building you know learning how to give to others and being less selfish and
um-hum
right
um-hum yeah
oh i agree with you i agree with you and i think young people are so focused just on themselves and their activities and whose going out with whom et cetera that
you know to get a taste of what the real world is actually about you know doing that public service would be great yeah
right
um-hum
oh yeah i would think so like right after high school you know even if it was like the their that summer right after high school you know three months
um-hum
uh-huh
right
you know something that was that was outside of outside of school
yeah but yeah you know right after you graduate from high school because a lot of people are just
well gee whiz what do i do now if they're not focused on going to college and you know having that gung ho plan that's you know setting their life goals
um-hum
um-hum yeah so to me see that would be the greatest time for you know teenagers to do that would be right after they graduated from high school
um-hum
right
oh right
uh-huh
yeah so yeah it'd be good but like i said it requiring it would be
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
hm
uh-huh
yeah
well i guess i guess i'm probably a little more toward the other direction
well i guess mainly because
it's i well like there's two sides to it i guess one is that if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever
or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then
i think that you know i don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot
but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business
and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that things like drug laws seem to come and go
you know we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't have prohibition
you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess maybe a little longer
yeah so eighty years or so yeah
so i you know it's hard to i guess for me to justify what seems like you know basically a breach of the first you know
freedom from search and seizure you know on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten who knows
i mean prohibition certainly didn't last
well but you got to look at prohibition though you had the same problems there right
oh yeah sure well it goes back to the again if you look at prohibition i mean because it's illegal it costs more if it was legal i mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce
and clearly if you're into coke and all you wanna do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
but yeah get
oh yeah well that's why there's you know why there's people dealing it because there's money in it you know there's a ridiculous amounts of money in it
oh yeah interdiction's hopeless
i mean there's no way you're ever gonna win that
the tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up so the more incentive there is i mean that's a losing fight
yeah
well yeah it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people i mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen i don't think you can i mean
you know i'm you know was raised with the very strong bible work ethic so you know i'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people
so you know yeah i can really relate to yeah everybody ought to do their own share you know i don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff
but you know
yeah i have five cats two dogs a snake and a bunny
well my cats are indoor outdoor cats and
but most of my cats go outside so there's not that much there i only have one who stays inside
oh no it's in a cage lot of people do but i've never been able to quite handle that with a rabbit
it's really my daughter's rabbit
i have i have one that's kind of a golden retriever mutt
and oh yeah oh yeah all my cats and my dogs and even the rabbit and the dogs and the cats everybody in my house gets along except the snake he kind of keeps to himself
right
well he's probably older and he's used to being the only dog and it's hard for him just like people it's hard for them to give up their
uh-huh
i think so too i really think that they are wonderful therapy they're companionship i'm
obviously i'm a i'm a real believer in them
yes i think so too
feeding it
that's right
ooh that's a big dog
really
oh yeah
yeah
sure
that's neat that's neat
hm i certainly can't argue with that definitely does need some improvements and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to
i think it's
it's four or five i can't remember which i was on a jury trial last year only i got kicked out
as the last selection
that the defense got
right but it still has to be a group of your peers
see
so if it's your peers and you're not educated
then
you want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit
as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them so that's why the defense is there
picking through them whereas at the same time the prosecutors sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him a guilty verdict if the facts warrant
so i think the jury selection process is pretty neat but i don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment
afterwards i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have i mean you're talking about the person's already been found guilty
right and many times i've seen on trials they have on tv the jury -ill make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever but i think that it should be up to the judge and the lawyers
to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be
maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system
and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure
as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure
well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime
but when it comes to sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system
then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury
at least in california they're supposed to be not during the trial during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background
but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down
i think that they should
i don't i don't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial they get too boring
well if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time
so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that'll hopefully work better
when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing i'm all for that
for small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things
i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are
yeah
well say embezzlement right you get a guy down the street
who comes up carrying a
had to face up to the issue of putting parents in a retirement home
uh-huh
yeah
well i've been very fortunate my father
was very careful in laying plans for his latter years
and he was very concerned that mother be provided for so he went through a process over a period of about five years
deciding where he wanted to be
and he made arrangements to sell his house and farm
and invested in a nursing home in central virginia
and moved in there
and he made that decision on his own and he made a good choice he found one that had pleasant conditions for him and mother living together and it had a nursing home attached to it
and everything sort of worked out very fortuitously because they moved into the to the retirement home in august
and he died in september
just before his eightieth birthday
and it was fortunate that
he had made those provisions because at that point mother had alzheimer's disease
and her mental faculties were going very rapidly
and that's something that's very stressful to handle
so we were very fortunate in having her in the right spot
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah my i have an aunt who's in a home in charlotte north carolina
and they had planned on that for a number of years and actually made the payment on the condominium or the apartment oh fifteen years before they moved in
and so when my aunt finally got to the point her eyesight deteriorated and she could no longer drive and it was getting awkward to get to the store for groceries and things like that
and she moved in it was only about
it's kind of amazing the disparity that exists between
i'm definitely against it definitely against it
i think that they make a the system makes a lot of mistakes and a lot of innocent people are probably convicted of crimes and it's bad enough when
you know when it's not capital punishment but when it's capital punishment when you find out later it's too late
but you can make it cheaper to kill people by not allowing all the appeals and as a matter of fact i think they are starting to cut back on some of them at the supreme court
i forgot what area it is but regarding capital punishment there are some cases that won't automatically get reviewed by the supreme court when they used to be
so what happens is you have to pay all these high powered lawyers to keep on arguing the case over and over again while they're waiting for capital punishment which is what happened which happens a lot a friend of mine does that type of work down in
down in tennessee he's a he's an attorney he represents people on death row
cynical about the system and the way people are convicted of crimes not that i think i do believe that most people are charged with crimes and certainly people that are convicted of crimes most of them are probably guilty anyway
i mean i'm not denying that but there are a few that probably aren't
yeah so
no huh they do in georgia right yeah they
right well that's the thing i mean i happened to have been talking to somebody at work today about that
just happened to come up in conversation and so i was surprised when i got this topic come up and the
what seventy three or whenever it was that they ruled that the death penalty was cruel and
yeah and whether it was unconstitutional and then like i said they came back and like the nineteen eighties and determined that if they have like a separate trial to determine the death penalty they call them bifricated trials
they have a separate trial just to determine whether they're going to give the death penalty or not
then that's okay they can it becomes constitutional i guess it's like a procedural protection that people have
but nobody's been nobody's been executed since they've brought that back and
yeah in tennessee so it puts a lot of pressure on them yeah
yeah
yeah but it's kind of like under duress anyway but you know kind of saying to someone all right now that we've got you by the chops because you decide whether you're going to die or not but yeah that's what that guy gary gilmore did right
you know the guy
right and they you know kind of chose his way to death which is kind of interesting but
yeah i personally think people have the right to die if they want so yeah if you if you're in if you're in jail for life then you should be able to commit suicide if that's what you want
yeah sure
i did some i did some environmental law as well and one of the i remember in studying something about the f d a they was it what the hell were they trying to do they were trying to get a drug
oh i guess it's hard tell i guess probably i didn't do much as a kid because we grew up on a farm and my whole life was camping but
later on later on i think when my oldest daughter got involved she and i got involved in indian princesses we used to go up at possum kingdom and do a lot of camping at possum kingdom
no i'm new england massachusetts
oh okay
uh-huh
yeah that
no hum
yeah
oh sure speaking of southern oklahoma you go up into the arbuckle mountains at all camping up in there
yeah we went up to i talking about being an indian princesses i was actually in it seven years with two daughters four with one three with the other and with my second daughter we camped up at camp classen one time
and well it's right
you know i'm trying to think where it is it's not too far over the border and it's up in the middle of the arbuckles and it's near turner falls
and that is just absolutely when you consider how flat everything is here that absolutely beautiful company to country to camp in
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah another thing how about have you been to the texans texoma side
oh for goodness sakes that is that is just really nice we kind of
you know i've been at ti thirty two years and in my young single days i used to camp there a lot then i sort of forgot about it for twenty years and
two years ago my children started they saw picture of it over at texans and we started going there again we sort of rediscovered it
yeah and it got a lot a lot of campsites you know there's
concrete pads that you can put tents on there's places to pull in rvs and plug them in up there's even two and what we used
they have got two log cabin shelters that are basically four walls and a roof log cabins with a concrete floor and a picnic table in them and a ceiling fan and screened windows
so you can kind of go in there and just bring your sleeping bag
and sleeping bags and air mattresses you can camp on the floor you got a roof over your head
yeah let come what may
yeah they're very close to the water within like a hundred yards
yeah they've got a place where you can keep your boat you can they've got the dock that you can tie up tie up and it it's in a protected area
so and i i've got a son
where the fishing pretty good and
you know we'll leave we'll leave him down there at ten o'clock at night with his fishing pole and sometimes go after him if a big storm comes up
but you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes from there but it's a ninety nine acre i think it's a ninety nine acre in fact they have acquired some more now that they are going they're going to clear but it's a long term lease from the corps of engineers
yeah you you've got to be a texas member but if you are a master member of texans the membership to texoma is free
you can you can get a family membership do you your family camp at all you camp with your family how what
oh boy
yeah
what kind of a boat do you have
uh-huh
yeah when i was yeah in my young in my young single days i had a turbocraft are you familiar with that
yeah i had a sixteen foot hundred and nine horse power six cylinder one and i had that for two or three years and then i traded it for a eighteen foot two hundred and twenty horsepower v eight
yeah
yeah plus it planed in about two inches of water so you never dragged on anything because there was nothing under it but unfortunately what i did was and i guess what happened when i was single i had it
and my wife and i skied a lot when we first got married and the children came along when they're real little they can't really participate and i guess i was paying more on insurance and maintenance than i was getting out of it and i sold it
and never had a chance really to get back to boating again
yeah
yeah
yeah you rediscover you rediscover it when the kids get old enough to do it yeah
yeah
yeah right where do you
oh okay i just i just let me ask you one more question where do you ski where you ski
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah i'll tell you i would recommend too texoma is nice because there is no many places you can ski there
and in the texans area has got two nice launching ramps
one of them is in a protected cove and the other one is okay if the lake is calm it's out more in the open the other place that i would really strongly recommend is possum kingdom
and that is absolutely the prettiest that
when i learned to slalom ski it was the only place i didn't mind swallowing and boy i swallowed a lot a lot of water learning and the only place i didn't mind swallowing half the lake and i didn't feel grungy about it like i did at lavon
ah no it's not over crowded it's it far enough away so it's not over crowded and it's surrounded by cliffs so no matter how much wind it is there is always a big portion of the lake that's calm
yeah its too open
yeah and there's they have got some forty to fifty foot high cliffs around possum kingdom and you just get up and ski adjacent to those and it doesn't make any difference how windy it is you don't notice it
yeah oh okay well you ready to wind up hey nice talking to you my friend yeah good night bye-bye
las vegas well my dad goes there but i am not a betting i've been there one time and i'll be honest i did not enjoy it no
i now i'm a big world traveler i enjoy traveling the world i just got back from hawaii this past july the prior year before that i'd been to tokyo disneyland
that's gonna be in paris france we're going there in july
and at the same time we're also gonna go visit norway i've always wanted to go see the fjords of norway i just love have you ever been on a cruise to alaska
okay
well i tell you what if i possibly can there's a spot that i would love to encourage you to go visit
my father same way
he had absolutely no desire to be around a boat he says man i get seasick i don't like it
the thing that is so wonderful about the alaskan cruise it is on what they call the inside passage
you're not in the ocean you are in a river almost
only the only thing you have are cliffs on the left and cliffs on the right side and we're talking about five hundred foot thousand foot cliffs
absolutely gorgeous
and every yeah and every thirty yards here comes another waterfall which is nothing more than the melting snow
that's just more glorious than the last one it is absolutely fantastic and with those cliffs the sunsets are just oh my goodness
for me and my wife it was probably the most romantic one week trip i have ever taken
well if that be the
i was gonna say you can go to the caribbean but the now the problem with the caribbean though now you've got the ocean and i've been to the caribbean three times now you got the ocean and if you have a motion sickness problem now they have these little patches you can put behind your ear
you'd wanna use those but the same time though you're not going to get as pleasant of a ride as you would on that alaskan cruise
now
oh have you have you been on the blue ridge parkway oh wow now that's fantastic
see i'm a louisiana boy so i know where you're talking about there
yes now that was my first trip i've ever been to hawaii yes
yeah
the coastline yeah the coastline here is the pits there's much better in florida much better other places hawaii was wonderful that was great
i thought waikiki beach was as nice of a of a beach as i ever wanna see and we went to four different islands we had a great time
well tell you what i've got a i've got a phone ringing on the other line i better go answer it i've enjoyed talking to you though catch you later bye-bye
i see
sure
uh-huh
well for me camping i've never owned a trailer so for me camping is has a lot more to do with backpacks and tents
but i guess that this two kinds of camping that i've done one is to throw a tent and food and the like in the back of a car and drive to a campsise and setup the tent and have the car right next to me
the other is to actually you know carry everything on your back i've done camping out in at in the aspen mountains in colorado where
right
exactly
i understand
oh yeah oh
right
but
exactly
um-hum
yeah when i mentioned i've done this camping out of the car i've actually done of the situation just like that but what's interesting is it's through texas instruments
yeah ti has a owns a piece of land on the edge of a lake that borders that the lake is on the border of texas and oklahoma it's called lake texoma
yeah that's right so that's where i've done most of that actually
it is it's really beautiful the lake is outstanding it's a huge lake
oh yeah
oh yeah i think
well if you every get to dallas you can probably you know you can go up there and get a space for the night for two bucks
yeah so it's easy to do i'm actually interested in getting one of those kind of my wife has been talking about this in the past couple of years one of those kind of campers that pop-up
so it's about maybe eight foot square and but only about two feet tall and when you get to where you're going it raises up and there's tenting material
yes exactly
exactly my wife has a lot of interest in those and i've actually been keeping my eye on the paper and they seem to be running between one and two thousand dollars which
sure
yeah
um-hum
oh yeah that
i see
oh yeah you said yours is eighteen feet long
oh yeah the brand is terry
oh i never heard of it
yeah
yeah
well that's neat
oh yeah that's something
yeah
yeah well that's great
right
oh yeah
yeah
right
um-hum
and you and you still do that
and so you drive to work from there or you just take the summer off
oh wow that's nice
yeah
i see
right
yeah
huh
i understand and
just want to get in and
yeah that's funny well
nice talking to you too
well i appreciate it
i'll do it nice talking to you ray bye-bye
probably not in anywhere near as much there have been a couple of articles which i've basically glanced at
but that's about it i just find it interesting that somebody with that much money would be interested in the presidency in the first place i guess it's as much you know just the sense of power and the sense of being able to accomplish things
as much as anything else i don't know it seems to me that if i had that kind of money i would feel like i were more influential as a private citizen than as the president
um-hum
hum no i hadn't really paid that much attention
uh-huh
wow
um-hum
what kind of i mean this obviously says something for his
you know something for one aspect of his character what kind of person is he in terms of
um-hum
be kind of a change
um-hum
i honestly don't think so not unless he really puts a lot of effort into it and i don't think he wants to i think it's
i think being a seriously being seriously considered as a presidential candidate is something that
it just takes a really huge investment in personal effort not just you know i mean i'm sure it takes a lot of money as well
but just in terms of the number of personal appearances that you've got to make and all the hoops that you've got to jump through in order to get the media sound bites and get people paying attention to you i mean
an occasional newspaper article will show up for any variety of things but being considered seriously i think is you know may take more than he's willing to put into it
hum
yeah well i don't suppose he'd have to do a whole lot of fund raising or
worry a whole lot about where the funding was coming from so he'd have that advantage
um-hum
yeah
yeah i've heard it in the billions i didn't hear specifics i figured once it you know once it reaches that point it doesn't really matter how many numbers are in front of the b you know it
it's passed it's passed any kind of reasonable imagining in the first place so
we have one she's only nine months old
right well my degree is in teaching so
so i
oh really
um-hum
um-hum
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble but it wasn't that bad i taught remedial reading kids
and well they don't call it remedial reading these days they call it something else but anyway at the time that's what i taught and
you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way
when you have your slow readers but it wasn't too bad we got along real well
yeah i especially with the real young ones i started out wanting to teach lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no i don't like this as much and ended up moving up and
got up until about the sixth grade and so that's what i got my certification in
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools
and my reason for that was i don't like
the
what's the right word the varied
inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools
you can find a lot of good public schools if you if you look real hard
but i don't think they could cover everything that you could
teach your children on an individual basis
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah
and the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the lower the lower schools
right
crazy for him to but
um-hum
yeah
well we had the problem when i was in with teaching i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with and if we did have a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools
or trying to teach them something while they were there
and you don't know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was trying to teach them was better than have them taken out
yeah
right most the time if they were they were some of them were even better behaved i've only had two instances where i it was really noticeable but they were better behaved when they were
i don't know if it was alcohol or something else that they were on but
it ended up better
but
i think there's a problem too with teachers trying to
to be so versatile that they do lose sight of the basics you know they've been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics
and i'm not
completely just you know just teach the basics in schools but i think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our lowering grades in the standardized test and such
but
right
um-hum
well i spent a year and a half in japan also and i've seen how their school system works and i they go by a complete rote system you just memorize everything
and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better memorizer you are the better your grades going to be
so i don't completely agree with that either
but there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere
is that what you ended up going into
oh
um-hum
how much you can stuff in your brain
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well
probably taking
no there's plenty of money in the system it's just
i think it's like a lot of things in the in the united states we've got so much built up in
in the in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there's no way that can be done
maybe on smaller scales
um-hum
yeah
um-hum right into the classroom it needs to be
be able to be enforced
um-hum
it's like doctors in lawsuits you know they're kind of fearful of everything
but
um-hum
right
um-hum
oh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home
yeah
right
um-hum
yeah they allow it under certain circumstances you have to prove that you're teaching them something you have to follow
a preferred curriculum well they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum although you don't have to
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be
they're kind of monitored
they are monitored by the
by the
state school board
so
um-hum
um-hum
i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
personally i'm in favor of capital punishment i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but
seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that the person just i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in prison for life
i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy
uh-huh
right
right
right
that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible
right
right yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah you're right there
i basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just
you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever
to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it
well i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case i mean i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
and in that case wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
not really that i can think of i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers
i don't really agree with the death penalty for people like noriega and such as that i think that they're
they're operating on a more i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but i don't really think that it's
it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs
um-hum
yeah
yeah that is very curious
yeah
that's right
well interestingly enough i've been reading in the paper about the option that says basically none of the above
and given the choices that's sometimes how i feel i generally support president bush and i feel like he gets a lot of bad press you know the economy is really not his fault i don't think
but as far as anybody else running i think
yeah what i heard this morning is that although he has dropped out he's still got a lot of support in new york apparently
and you know it today is the new york primary and they seem to be saying that if he got a good he's still on the ballot in new york and they said if he got a good showing in new york then he would jump back in
i don't know maybe you know new york is a big primary
and there are a lot of others still to come maybe he feels like if he can carry new york strongly then he could still make it
but i don't know
it's hard to say it's nice to get somebody in there i would certainly never vote for him as far as i know
but it it's nice to have somebody else bring some issues to the front and at least ask the president some questions and have him have to defend himself
so i think in that sense it's good i don't think that he's experienced enough to do the job
how about you
yeah
um-hum
i'm sure that we can say it helped the enemy rate of kuwait and sure it shook a few people up in iraq but
is that a success or is that just sort of part of the job description as far as the president goes
yeah
oh yeah his popularity was somewhere close to ninety percent at the time
and it
yeah
uh-huh
a very minuscule portion so what about libya
yeah
you you've heard of the goings on there i guess
i thought it was i have to make sure i get the stories right because there was also yesterday the attacks on the embassy but now didn't libya
i oh i live in dallas yep but i i'm out of breath because i had to run to find my card because i didn't remember my pin i haven't done this in a while it's been probably three or four months i think
yeah well we got on it a long time ago but then it was down so much of the time you kind of got out of the out of the habit
so anyway so what are we supposed to talk about
okay so what magazines do you take
yes
well now if you don't take any magazines why would you why would you want to talk about magazines
i subscribe to lots of magazines yes my family well we're kind of renowned for being big magazine subscribers
well because i have a lot of interests and the magazines have a lot of interesting articles and
well let's see i get a magazine called the economist get the atlantic monthly i get harpers we get newsweek
i get magazine called fine woodworking what else do we get here
let's see then i get a bunch of magazines at the office like fortune and forbes i oh i get the new republic here at the house as well i read business week
so i don't know we i'd probably some and sometimes i take them for a while and then sometimes i you know i'll let them lapse and then i'll get something new
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
do you are you in school out at out at tech really which year are you in out there
do you like it
well how'd you get on this ti thing then
uh-huh
oh
okay
yeah well it's not too hard but i i've called in a couple times but then like i said it was down so much that i got out of the habit and then i'm not usually home so i'm not usually here when they try because i don't i haven't done it very often
well now what magazines do you like to read
well if you had a hundred bucks and you couldn't do anything except spend them on magazines what magazines would you would you would you would you buy
oh really
those magazines are like phone books aren't they they're like two thousand pages of ads or something in them
really
really
there so did you did you ride them and stuff what do they call it dursege and
uh-huh
um-hum my
well you could buy an awful lot of bride magazines for a hundred dollars i don't know
we have some newsstands here in dallas you know that have like thousands of magazines and i could buy a lot i could buy a lot of magazines
well there's more that i could get
um-hum well they have a lot of they i don't know they have a lot of different kinds of ads and stuff in them
yeah
i so what are you majoring in out there
really
you like lubbock better than dallas why
really well people are nice here in dallas
you don't think so huh
where'd you go to high school
oh my son goes to richardson high school
is that right yeah well i never thought about that but there is an arlington like i had a card the other day from birmingham michigan
you know and i was thinking yeah and i was thinking the only birmingham i could think of was alabama
yeah well tell me what kind of books have you read
uh-huh
yeah it is because you know that it's really and truly a the true thing you know i read one about bob hope that i liked
yeah that was real good i'm like you if it's not a heavy biography you know i enjoy it
it was a lot of fun because they used these real names you know
yes in fact i believe it was because uh-huh i believe
yeah i think it was by her that you mention it because someone had given it to me and i thought well this will be great and it was
you know
um-hum well when you use real people like that i think you know and royalty especially you know
our movie stars because it's totally different concept to us
but i haven't i haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either i have read mostly novels i went to visit my daughter in florida and i took a novel with me oh
and read it at thanksgiving time and
it was one of those generation novels you know starts out when they're small and continues through generations and i like that you know
yes i have
oh she is wonderful
well no it seems like she doesn't write as often as oh well like danielle steele and those silly things she writes the same thing
yeah and they're the same silly things i mean if you've read one there i mean it's you know it's
it it's practically the same thing over and over you know
yeah wouldn't i you know i'm criticizing her and wouldn't i like to have her money
you know because they go from hardback to paperback and she has millions of them um-hum
you know miniseries and so forth but i seems to me like susan howatch does not write as often i have not seen as many of hers
um-hum
i think she does a lot of research too
huh-uh
yeah
no i don't think so and i've often wondered why haven't you know i
yeah
um-hum maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them you know
um-hum
yeah well and maybe that turns people off but look at gone with the wind you know
have you gotten into scarlett yet
and then when it came out all i heard was just how bad it was that i didn't even wanna get it
hum-um
no
well it wouldn't surprise me
well i'm
getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the time than they're
right
well see we don't have any room in our prisons so
they shuttle them in and shuttle them out and they get them get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks and then they're paroled to make room for the newest criminals
and it just it it's just really absurd
i think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now so many different things coming in so many different directions
that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it
yeah
yep
well i don't know what the answer is but i know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working so
i hope so i don't
oh i definitely believe in capital punishment
it's when they it's when they're in on death row for nineteen years that i don't i'm kind of curious about
yeah you can appeal now in north carolina for almost a period of twenty years
yeah you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you i think the i think it's the average is eight to ten years to get it to the north carolina supreme court
they're hoping i guess they're what they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did but it just
we have a serious problem in we have so many problems in this state right now and the thing is the
the fundamental problem is the is
yeah got four
yeah let's see fourteen twelve
five and one and a half i was yeah how about you
no huh-uh no she my wife stays home
yeah how about how about yourself
do you huh
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
so what would you what is there a certain ratio that would scare you off or of teachers to kids
uh-huh
uh-huh
so you're talking now you're pretty well limited to home care then someone taking your kid into their home yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
did you
you didn't
so do i
okay
yeah
and it looked when the parents visited it looked like that everything looked fine and they told them one ratio of adults to kids and that appeared to be what the case when they were there but then
then it turned out that so how do you protect yourself against that i wonder
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well we've been my wife has stayed home fourteen years now and it yeah it's not always been easy
to do because there are many times when another salary would be real helpful
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah my wife worked at a has worked at a couple of those too and she's never
never been satisfied with what the children were getting and then she worked not to long ago for just
filling in she filled in at a real large commercial commercially run where there were like i don't know how many kids there were but it was twenty kids in a room and i don't know how many adults they had but
so
i have a personal computer at home it's an at compatible
i don't use it very much any more i used to use it quite a bit
i also have a pc at work that i use as a terminal i do some pc stand alone work on it and i can transfer data back and forth between the pc and the main frame
what about you do you own a computer
are you leasing them
loaners from work
do you work for ti
what brand are they
um-hum
i'm jealous
what kind of consulting do you do
uh-huh
what kind of work do you do when you're consulting
is it programming related
uh-huh
word processing
no i'm not familiar with it
um-hum
so you've got you've got a modem in it then
at home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them
and so it's an external modem i got when i got mine i had an internal modem in it i used it quite a bit when i was
looking at information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a
in fort worth but went out of town for a while and sort of got off the bulletin board and off of my micro completely
and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without even without using it on the computer i could turn a computer on it'd start squawking so i finally opened up the box and took it out
i think that's the thirty second warning
yes
okay where
where are you and
are you at home now so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
what time is it now where you are
so you're an hour ahead of where i am i'm in central time zone
no i haven't done that i know someone who has and she's very pleased with it she told me some of the things you can do and it's just a very handy tool to have
yeah and you can do a it makes things very convenient you can save a lot of money too certainly cut down on long distance charges if you if that's what you have in mind
i have i have used lotus i have used word perfect i not heavy use i've used d base and i've used a substantial amount of shareware
i haven't done much lotus work connected with my job i've been through three classes and i have a great deal of respect for it
i haven't done much word processing work with my job i do some and i and the d base work i've done was strictly class related
well it's probably the
granddaddy of most data base management systems there it's got some pretty strong competitors some of them have reviews that are better than d base so i think by now it's a matter of personal taste
i can understand that very easily i've used i've had a class on r base and also in paradox and both of those seem very easy to use compared to d base
i also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility
sometimes i get called late at night at home because there's a production problem and that gives me the opportunity to
come in to work and fix it if i can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone
i also handle most of the calls from our users and
other programmers who need to find out something were connected
each teacher is expected to deal with in some quality way i think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job
do you do you have children in the public school system
is that right
oh no well i'm i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back and i'm just really in a dilemma if that's what you know i'd love
to work with children and to teach them but i'm really having questions if i can deal with that system and have a good conscience about you know what i do i don't think
i don't think it's the teachers i think it's the system but
right
what child's gonna say something some parent's going to overreact to that's
i have two i have in the system one is in ninth grade and one is in seventh grade and them i'm home schooling my kindergartner this year
oh
still at it
well the explanation i was given about you know they seemed to admit that it wasn't working but they didn't have the money to restructure but looks to me that it wouldn't take
really that much money to at least come up with i mean some kind of partitions you know
just yeah
oh goodness
oh
were they
well we were from north carolina and of course north carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education i think they rank about forty ninth but our children got a very good education there they were in the magnet school program
and a lot of their classes from the time they were about third grade they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes
isn't that interesting i don't understand how they get this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money i don't know
i guess so well my son is at clark this year too so we're yes
what to expect really you know how to judge it
well that's good
yeah
well eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any so that's interesting but he his grades i haven't seen them yet but supposedly they're good so
no
i've never had any children
i'm opinionated
uh-huh
um-hum
wow
um-hum
five
wow
uh-huh well you had to have something to even it out there
had to have something to even it out
right
i was going to say that's a black forest cuckoo clock you have
i can tell by the sound
airline pilot for what airline
what airline
really
my dad flies american he's retiring in april
yeah
oh twenty some odd years
twenty four twenty three something like that
well he'll enjoy the freedom that kind of a job gives you course
yeah that's what my dad says you know as soon as he is retired he's gonna you know hire some hire an airplane
because he really likes to fly
huh
well huh
i'm thirty seven
we can't
we tried but it's just not gonna happen
well we have animals and we have chickens and dogs and cats and birds
yeah we have a little you know just about ten acres out here out you know about ninety miles north and west of dallas
so it it's stop it's a lot of fun i'm building our house right now
well i was a you know contractor for past fifteen years
doing anything from you know bagging concrete for a pad or you know i did couple of complete remakes of a house you know tore down and started over almost on one of them
yeah my specialty is in restoration
and
i figured well i'll build myself a house
you know and i'm doing it now as a matter of fact i just got out of the shower
no not that close hey don't televise that down here
well we don't take cable i mean it would cost a fortune
you know there was no phone service for ten miles
yeah we are crazy as they say
yeah
i went to salt lake once
and i was very i guess we were seven or eight
but
oh yeah raising kids
i think the first thing you got to do is unplug your tv set and give it to the salvation army
yeah
yeah
yeah but i've worked well i work and live in the denton area
in the denton texas just north of dallas
and you know i'll tell you i went to i graduated from the university of north texas a couple years ago and i you know went back as
oh absolutely
i see i do many people listen to country music
um-hum
yes i don't particularly care for that
um-hum
right well country music is not that sad kind of cry in your beer you know the expression kind of music it's got a lot better uplifting beat now
and it sounds better and i think more people all generations like it a lot better
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
definitely
well i think that's gosh that is about the only thing that i listen to i'm originally from tennessee and of course that's a big country music place too and that's all i heard growing up
so you know that's golly that's big and popular
yeah
well i can i can i don't we don't smoke so we really don't go to bars or anything but used to you know back in the single days
but yeah i can how about you
oh for sure
you know i really i like the seventies music and oldies music fifties sixties that type of music
i run and i like to run just various music either like seventies music or country or the oldies
oh absolutely yeah and you know that's what i have gotten away from is what like the top forty stuff is i don't i couldn't hardly i couldn't tell you right now what the top one or two songs are
oh yeah absolutely foreigner and santana and all that in fact i was listening to that on my way home today but i enjoy that type of music
oh yeah the who
it is old
isn't that funny
but it does yeah it's kind of like making a comeback it's just cyclical and just kind of making a comeback now i guess and that's what they enjoy hearing
you know when i was in high school that some of this kind of music was popular and that's what i like to hear right now even
well i was in band in high school and i played clarinet then i took piano lessons
yes i do um-hum and i like jazz that kind do you do you
i just i've really not been around that very much to say actually if i could really say if i liked it or not

i don't really get into that naturally i'm married so my husband goes a lot and we'll go and just do what we want to do and then leave
but yeah and swimming is a is a part that i i'd like to get into as far as my you know just aerobic activity
they say that swimming is real good so i'd like to try that as well and that's probably something that you could do you know family included
um-hum
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah i agree
yeah
okay
yeah
well try it or maybe just exercise at home i bought a tape and i'm going to try doing that
uh-huh
yeah that's me
um-hum
thanks a lot bye-bye
and collect it but i think the i think it's pretty expensive to do
well from i can tell what i've seen of it they have different color containers and you sort of sort it out
in your home and then put it out on the curb and they just throw the matching color
container yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well it's kind of funny i saw a special on a public broadcasting station down here and they were talking about recycling and
they i forgot exactly where this was but
they were showing just piles and piles of plastic and glass that was at a recycling center but it was costing them
about forty dollars a ton to recycle and they could only get about ten dollars a ton for it
and
i'm not sure i
oh
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah it's
something i think about a lot too is you know when you're buying
everything is you know if it's not convenient people don't want it
yeah
yeah
yeah
is all you need
i think just one is all you need
well we don't right now we're planning on setting one up as soon as i can get some you know some better ideas on how to do that have you used one before
hm
oh yeah i've heard of that
um-hum
um-hum
have you put money into those categories or what do you do for that sort of thing
um-hum
um-hum
well do you have any money that you specifically set aside for certain you know savings objectives
i mean where do you put that money
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
that's probably the key part right there is waiting until you get the money that you budgeted
i say that's probably the key part right there is waiting until the money that you've planned for is there what about credit cards do have you do you still use those or
is that part of the system to discontinue that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
yes
you know we've just seen the need for well we just moved into a house that we're renting and that's gonna
yeah it really will so we're you know we're going to have to really take a hard look at our expenses and things like that and
you know really make the dollars go a little bit further if we can and we had not been paying very much for housing since we moved to dallas in july
and you know we'd go out to eat on sunday after church or something like that and i think we're gonna have to kind of watch what we do now because that can add up with five kids
define everyday occurrences
every time you use a credit card every time you log in to a computer terminal particularly where you have access to a to a network
anybody can with the right kind of skill and tools
get very much involved in those things which are on your system that you don't particularly want exposed that's why we have such security measures for our corporate information
if you absolutely
um-hum
that's right when was the last time that you used a credit card that they didn't ask for your driver's license as well
really
well most of our checks are even printed with our address our even our driver's license numbers are printed on there
because they require that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right but we're talking about people who are interested in invading your privacy people who have a reason to do that
people who are interested in building data bases of information about your financial background your educational background
one of the biggest fraud scams that i've heard of recently is people who have access to such information and they find out who's a widow and what she's worth and then they present themselves to her as a rich suitor
and bilk her out of anything that she has those
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
there are very vulnerable people though older people are very vulnerable to such things and they tend to
um-hum
well on the other hand how can you be savvy with so much out there today there are so many clever scams
and many of them are computer based and they're based on information that's available
in the public realm
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
um-hum did you have you registered for a conference recently
okay did they ask for your fax number
okay i registered my people for several conferences in the past six months and they'll ask for your telephone number and they'll also ask for a fax number you would think on the surface that is for
rapidly sending you confirmation of your registration or your hotel or something like that not at all those fax phone number lists are being sold in exactly the same way your street address numbers are sold and you now get solicitations brought over your fax
and you don't expect it from that source therefore you're not as
you know you're not as leery
some cases
but it exists is what i'm saying those avenues exist
um-hum
i heard a story not long ago this guy saw a really attractive young woman and he said hey i'd like to know this girl more so he wrote down her license plate number
and he called a friend in motor vehicles and got her address and her telephone number and then he called a friend that he had in the credit bureau and he got her financial standing
okay
from that he also got her social security number and certain social security information is
a matter of is it is accessible if you know somebody in the government so before it was over with he knew that she was divorced she had two children what school they went to what her average income was he knew that she'd gotten a boat in the divorce because he was able to get those public records
he knew all about her
and he yeah he introduced himself to her he said i think our kids went to school together at such and such school i don't really remember that
and i mean you know he was relying on her not remembering or
or not being willing to admit that she didn't remember him and just moved right in on her
sure
um-hum
um-hum that's right
um-hum
um-hum that's true i'm still getting lists from many years ago
or getting junk mail from a list that had to have been made years ago
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
of course
no you can't stop them from selling your lists although some of them really are honorable organizations and they will say if you prefer us not to put your name on a mailing list then we will not
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum and you have to really do some research or you do not find out who is legitimate and who is not and sometimes finding out who is legitimate and who is not is more difficult than finding out public information about people
um-hum
um-hum
absolutely
that's right
um-hum
oh yeah you bet you bet and with computer technology now look how spooky it is for how accessible these things are
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
sure
um-hum
um-hum
way to go neat
that's great
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah they don't put as many of those prepaid envelopes in there anymore
not as many as i've seen in the past
um-hum
yeah
that's possible i really don't understand that either but my stars some of it sometimes it's very difficult now the gasoline credit cards require your license plate number as opposed to your drivers license
although some of them have a blank on there for it they don't generally enforce using it
i've not seen one of those
um-hum
um-hum
yes i have a daughter
oh okay
well we go out and fly kites and we go fishing and we go to movies
and we go out to the farm and she likes to pick flowers and look at birds
well i'm divorced but that's what when she's with me that's what we do
and we color a lot and i read her stories and
yep
yeah
yep
um-hum
yeah and even when i was when i was living with her and we did stuff then too so
yeah i know
um-hum
yeah that's right
because then you never get to know them either they're all grown up and their you know
yeah
um-hum
yeah they're out doing stuff by that time
yeah i really do because i don't see many other this and when whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays we'll see other families
but not usually on the on the weekends we don't see very many in comparison
well i think they ought to turn off the tv for one thing
and go out and do stuff you know because she always likes to do things whenever the tv's off you know she'll forget about the tv completely
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
and we
she's five
we just been hitting the ball on the ground
she can't hit it in the air yet and then we kick the ball we play like soccer
um-hum
yeah
nice talking to you okay bye-bye
well i had planned a very successful cousins reunion i have a lot of cousins and i did that several years ago in fact it was so well received they've been really having a pi fit for me to do it again
um-hum
um-hum
good
oh how neat
uh-huh is it going to be over a several day period or was it over
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum well that's kind of nice to be able to do that for both occasions my family
it was only funerals and so it was kind of sad so about i guess it was about two or three years ago i planed this cousins reunion and how i my cousins even though we're all
fairly close there's only two or three of them that's out of town and out of state
and
so i just sent to the oldest child in each you know in each family
my oldest cousin in every family to send me their
brother's and sister's names and addresses and their names of their spouses
and i got pretty good response from that had to do a little phone work and then i just sent out a real neat little memo to everybody
and i it just worked out really well
oh my word
um-hum
well i can imagine it's hard to get that many people together
um-hum
oh shoot well how often do you all do you try to have like reunion
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum oh well that's that would be fun uh-huh
uh-hum
um-hum
well i don't know about you but neighborhoods just aren't like that anymore and if you can you know get together with an old neighborhood like that is really neat
um-hum
oh sure and to find out what happened to everybody right um-hum
um-hum
well one of the fun things i did was when i sent out my invitations i mean they weren't like invitations i just did it on a
on a plain sheet of typewriting paper and i took old photographs of my cousins when they were little real little and just did kind of a collage
on that you know and just printed it on a real good copy machine you know you they weren't really good pictures but that you could tell who everybody was and it
and everybody got a big kick out of that because there were a lot of pictures that i had that nobody else had
um-hum
um-hum
it was it was different than that
i'm not too happy about the idea although
i do realize that sometimes it becomes necessary to do that or to have round the clock kind of care available in the house
which often is not that easy to do sometimes it really is easier to put the person right in the central place where the care can be given
i'm very happy that in my life so far i have not had to do that kind of a thing
my own mother lived with us for some years and just died peacefully within a short amount of time at the end of her life and i never had to face that personally
and what do you think you might do in such a situation
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh
oh yes
i see
um-hum
uh-huh
that's right um-hum
yeah people are just not as home as much as they used to be sometimes persons are still working and are not retired yet and
and therefore they have to leave the older person all the by themselves or with the care of somebody else and some of the diseases that older people have do require more intensive surveillance
so it isn't easy i suppose one of the
best things if you are considering a nursing home is to inquire among friends and get personal recommendations i know i always trust the opinion of a
close friend above just what i might read about a place if somebody i knew and cared about liked a place and said no this was good and
we were happy about the personnel and the care et cetera and so forth i would it certainly would go up in my estimation
and sometimes we as you said don't know a lot about where we are putting somebody that we care about and it's hard to know what the best place is um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
well there's hope i guess has your grandmother always lived in california
oh
i see yeah
yeah what part of california is that
oh i see we used to live out there in the san jose area so you know i'm kind of familiar with the state of california and like it very much yeah
but it's a difficult situation sometimes also when you get involved in the
in those residences for the elderly the retirement homes and also maybe even the nursing division of a residence home
it's tremendously expensive and sometimes they ask you to
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
right yeah i know i do have a you know a computer at home but it's one that the company has loaned me and that that's been my situation is that way i can get in access our
computers that i have up here and you know do work from home
oh yeah
right uh-huh
right
right
yeah
right yeah no i have both because that that's what i use all the time is unix systems versus the dos but then i teach dos classes at night uh-huh part time so
well that that's the really neat thing i teach in the continuing education classes so i don't i don't have to have grade any grades no grade books so that's great
but no i find that i use the personal computer a lot though for my wordperfect and also for my spread sheets so i think it's extremely helpful and very useful
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
right
um-hum
right
right
that's true that's true
uh-huh
oh um-hum
um-hum
oh um-hum
what a hassle yeah
um-hum
yeah
right yeah
um-hum
right
yeah and i love all the windows that they have out now too they have really simplified things
right
right
uh-huh
um-hum
yes
yes
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
i graduated in eighty six
yeah so it's been fairly recent
the cards
ah dear i didn't have to bother with that at all thank goodness yeah
yes
wow
uh-huh wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
oh sure oh sure
right yeah and the two eighty six too so yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah oh
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's true
well
okay
i suspect a lot of people got turned on by watching those go off very exciting
the
i've always wanted very much to be somehow involved in all that
and to meet and to see it actually happen of course i've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday
but that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately
computer programmer
yeah made the wrong career choice to get up into space
the
i used to think when i was when i was younger that by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now
frustrating at times
uh-huh
yeah
well
yeah well the
i've always felt that one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up
because that's a you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require any particularly nasty environmental impact
and you can just get as much power as you need up there it's a matter of how big you build it
so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good know very good for all for everyone in the long run is it some of the other things i'd like to see happen would happen also
so
i'm
yeah right
right the only problem is of course that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
you know no one the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like the trip to mars
which is would produce some useful scientific research and so forth but
the same money could probably be far better spent on lunar bases and solar power satellite research and so forth
it would be it would be being done for the glitz and show factor
to get politician's votes instead of instead of for you know we should eventually send someone people to mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so
the downside of that is that you after you do one of those people say well we did it
no need to use this to play around with this space stuff anymore that's what happened with apollo
but
okay yeah the topic is car repairs and the last one i've had done it was a fluke the last one i had done
well i was driving down six thirty five at the coming from north dallas
and i was going almost hitting the
entry where all the merges go from six thirty five seventy five and coit and all of a sudden i get this liquid all over my hood and my windshield
and i had smelled it before i thought and i thought
that it was coming from another vehicle
and then when i saw it go all over my car i thought oh something
came through my radiator and just
something's wrong inside my car so i was waiting for my car to collapse you know i go i was going about sixty five miles an hour
and it kept going and i thought well what is going on
and so i made it home and i looked at my car and it was a mess
so i immediately the next morning i took it to my dealer
and i left it just how i drove it in the night before and he says well it looks like your antifreeze
something happened to your antifreeze
and they checked everything in that car and it wasn't from my car
it was from some other car some other car did that to me well i'm glad but it was a very panicky situation
oh you do well good for you
that's great
oh i see oh well he probably showed you all the tricks of the trade that's great
sure
well gee you should you know you should get some money for your talents and start branching out
oh well you know loosening those nuts and bolts would be a problem for me
and i know they have some really sophisticated equipment today where they do it electronically and all that but that takes money to buy those kind of tools too
um-hum
um-hum
right yeah no i wouldn't want
i wouldn't want anybody to touch my car without having all the yeah the computer and all and everything
because you have that as a as a gift to you don't you that they do it for you for gratis
uh-huh right
well i have a woman's agreement on mine and they did it for three years
yeah that really was nice so i appreciated that
a present that they gave me
oh
um-hum
right
well don't they have if you that they hook it up to the computer and the computer does the analysis and tells you what's wrong with different areas yeah
um-hum
well i have put windshield washer solvent in the container but and
it's been a super car it's let's see it's three years old
it's a plymouth acclaim
i really like it it's a been a very dependable
no maintenance i have not
yes we have ours every three years and we have relatives in mexico and brownsville texas and pennsylvania ohio
west virginia and florida so we've got them everywhere new jersey and that's why we only have one every three years so that everybody can get together and we have one from early morning it starts at eleven
and it goes all day and we just had one a year and a half ago we have it every summer in a
place called bare rocks
i hadn't seen cousins that i hadn't seen for years and others that are new in the family from marriage or
um-hum
aren't they wonderful
it's a shame that people can't get together like that more often and
have a close family tie
uh-huh
yeah
that sounds like fun we only have ours for that one day and
then we make plans who's going to have the next one where it's going to be and all that and the next one i believe is going to be in new jersey next year
so
do you have a large family
uh-huh
well that's good how many was in your family
uh-huh
um-hum
what's the holiday
oh
is there a special type of festivities for that occasion too
uh-huh
okay
well i sing i don't play an instrument though
oh not right now
oh pretty much anything
oh yeah a long time out all through college and everything i was in the choirs
and i've had some classical vocal training um-hum
no i was in europe
in germany
oh yeah
um-hum
soprano
oh well as far as opera goes i'm i think most fond of verdi
no i haven't done
i'd love to but
that's puccini i think right
um-hum
yeah
no
i think it would be nice if i played the piano
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
oh i like to listen to all different kinds of music
um-hum
yeah
there's you know some of the really totally country stuff i don't really particularly like but
well i have i have like we i wish i could but i don't really know how to go about it without having a degree or
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
that's good
uh-huh yeah
oh i'm in flower mound uh-huh
yeah that's pretty close
yeah
i'm married
i'm sorry
oh a little bit
yeah i think so
i think
okay
all right thanks
bye-bye
well i think for me i i'm from alabama south alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement
in a pretty liberal family for that area at the time
in that area and i guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago
for me when i think about social change that's what i first think of because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well that's true
that's a good one right there
right and i grew up in out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family
and so we were always at family in different family members' homes but even now you know they don't even do that
well and they're so busy people people's personal schedules are so busy
mainly because i a lot of it has to do i think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked and now almost all the women work
that's right and now i mean my mother does not work and she you know she's finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women
but even just social visits people don't do that anymore you're right and people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore
there's a real
right you know you don't want to you want to make sure it's okay or i guess we don't not to make invade people's privacy or whatever
well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles
and most live within ten or twenty so but that's you know that is rural it's a rural family and
most people didn't go away i'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the you know even in the same state
yeah there is in that area
um-hum and i guess you know that would greatly affect social i use social change probably the job market has and the economy has always affected social change
probably
well i think just also you know
the women's movement too has affected a lot of social change people marry
yeah people marry later
i mean basically i think now again where i'm from in alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school
but now out here in texas where i am now that's very unusual
be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up
right but probably you know more women being in the work force also greatly affects social change because it affects child care and
but
right
well and they're you know they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties
they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care and so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does
uh-huh
where do they live
well they're not too far though
uh-huh
well i live like fourteen hours from home in fact i'm
i'm driving i'm driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the fourth of july
no i can drive it all it's just me so i can make it i'm thirty five
although it's it is pretty i don't know i don't enjoy it that much it's pretty much like get there and
it's just not that pleasant even with other people i basically just don't like to drive that far
uh-huh
when you say you're in the second phase of this project what is the second phase of it
oh
well first of all i think they understated the turnout it's i don't i don't think that in a national election it's ever been under fifty three percent well it's almost half but it's been you know it's somewhere in the fifties for sure so it understates it a little bit
i think that it's easy if you if you think things are going bad enough to just turn off to the news and just not pay any attention it's the less you pay attention the less you know about what's going to effect you
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah
yeah and try to get voter guides from newspapers and things and that helps a little bit
they don't ask their they don't ask enough questions they ask on one or two issues and people can respond with platitudes
there was a back when i was living in pittsburgh there was a group called the association for public justice i don't know if you've ever heard of them
perhaps not it's it they really didn't you know it sounds like they're some kind of liberal group well they were a little bit liberal on some things but they were a little bit conservative on some things too
now it wasn't that great in that they didn't tailor the question for you know for the particular office so they asked people on the local level things that only come up at the national level and vice versa
but other than that it was a very good way to see who you sympathized with and you could vote on the basis of that
uh-huh
uh-huh
things like abortion presumably
huh
yeah right
right
uh-huh
i
do you know what group did it
uh-huh
yup
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right because yeah i mean once they
yeah that's right that's one point that was made that you know i read one article saying even if you don't think that abortion makes any difference at you know at a at a really local level like city council or something like that
these people will in the end they might get elected to something bigger and the way that they get known is by getting elected these to these to little offices
so you got to look at their views and that was a point that i hadn't considered the reason i ask about the organization is i just got started working last year in an organization called christian coalition which does just what you were suggesting and i was wondering if it was
if it was theirs yeah
uh-huh
the bottom line that i after four years of working with the state prison system i've come to the conclusion if you're going to give the man the death sentence
go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the supreme court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence
if you're going to give the man the death sentence don't keep the guy on death row for eight nine ten years and make him worry about it
plus costing the taxpayers twenty five thousand dollars a year just to keep the guy locked up
no
i do not think one appeal is everybody's entitled to one appeal
absolutely and i wish they would exercise it more thoroughly let the punishment fit the crime in this state we've got a very weird situation going on we're under federal supervision
and i agree to a point i agree with how the system works in some respects in other ways i don't for first time offenders everybody's entitled to screw up once we'll give them the early release credits we'll give them the good time credits we'll give them the early parole
second trip down whether it's for the same crime or totally separate one you serve your sentence day for day
third trip down this is where
my views on it goes way far beyond what the law states
third trip down if it's for the same offense or for a totally different one this individual has proven that he does not want to conform to the rules of society so you kill him period end of story
texas has got it rigged to where i can't the guy can enter my property and i can't shoot him but once he's physically inside my house
the law reads to where you can defend yourself if you feel your life is being threatened yeah at two o'clock in the morning if somebody's in my living room i feel real threatened so i'm going to come out with guns blazing
well the legal system in this country has gone to such extreme measures they've swung so far away from
there is no such thing as justice in this
country anymore we only have situation ethics
i said yeah the guy robs the liquor store and yeah he shot the owner but he was under the influence of narcotics
that should make absolute zero difference you shot the guy you get the death penalty period
that should be automatic death penalty no if ands or buts
but that's what's got our system bogged down so bad now they've appealed everything to where if they've got one typographical error where in their
in one line instead of spelling
they've got one word misspelled i mean it's a very minor clerical error they couldn't tell they they'll appeal the hell out of that and that just throws another wrench and it takes two years to work an appeal
uh-huh
since so people that came up with the laws that made all these loopholes and technicalities take a look at your congressmen and senators you'll find that the vast majority of them are practicing lawyers
that's it what they don't realize the time is coming and i see it coming over the horizon that the majority of american people are getting fed up with their bs and are going to demand real justice instead of this
in texas we're getting to a point where a guy gets a fifteen year sentence he's going to serve fifteen months and he's out
one month for one year actually assigned
overcrowding
overcrowding
we've gone too far to the left it's fixing to come back hard right
yeah i've been with them for about four years now
all things considered i'd rather be a cop on the street because once i walk inside the gates the inmates have more rights than i do
say an inmate swings at me or he's raised his fist threateningly toward me i've got to let him hit me before i can hit him back to be justified have it called what they call a justified use of force
thank federal judge named william wayne justice
no in inside the gate i do not carry any weapon at all
nothing
so they can't take it away from you
oh it all boiled down to when the opening for this came up it was the best deal going it was paying so much more money than what i was making before i couldn't turn it down
actually really
and good
well today when i got up it was twenty nine degrees
is that right
oh really
but not but no rain at all yesterday and no rain today
oh was it
what's that
oh yes well that's about the way our weather is here also
and i grew up in saint louis and saint louis was much the same
no it's not this is about ten degrees cooler than usual but about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty five degrees
no it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems
it no it really was extremely warm it only got down to about sixty five in the evening
we had about three or four days of that and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time
and it has gone down gradually each day this morning it was twenty nine yesterday it was about thirty two cars were scraping ice off their cars this morning if they've been sitting out all night
oh i hope not
well they are predicting rain and thunderstorms and i wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had
yes
yes
we had a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the of the city of dayton itself
and then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour
it was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning
it wasn't it wasn't conditions to being out in it and i had just gotten home we had a lot of tornado warnings also
and i had gotten home shortly before that the rain started so i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it
is that right
uh-huh
yeah
very fortunate for them
because that could have really been disastrous
well of course this is tornado season in to we have many tornadoes spawned in this area and northern indiana now we're in the southwestern part of ohio
just forty miles north due north of cincinnati and but northern indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across and we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself
so we you know we get a lot of bad weather in this area
but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion
um-hum
right yes i was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed
to having to drive in it
right
and
right
um-hum
right well here what they do and i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt
and of course the salt does melt the ice but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes a perpetual problem
oh it sure does do that
well sand and but i have learned to do is now that i am alone is to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car
not only in case i need it for that for traction but for additional weight in the back of the car and then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that
i don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of that but
yeah
well the dogs don't use litter but kitty litter is excellent for getting under the wheels of cars and what have you and giving you traction uh-huh
yeah it works out really quite well course i have i have a dog also my son brought me a little lhasa apso for my birthday last thanksgiving he brought him from dallas he
yes that he just thought i had been without a dog for three years that was long enough
he had
oh a what
now that one i'm not familiar with
yes right well i've always had big dogs before never had a little dog before and
yes well
oh well i had a german short hair that was frightened of storms the minute it would begin to storm he would just panic
and i had to put him down when he was fourteen and two months later i had to put my yellow lab down because he had leukemia
oh well it was great i loved it but then i didn't need all that anymore so i finally sold that and i'm in a fair size condo and i have a nice size patio
and so this little dog has plenty of room to run
yeah and he is a cutie and but i've never had a dog i had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either and it's
is that right
oh is that right
oh well i was there once way back in nineteen sixty i think for just a week's vacation
but i that's about the only time i've been to florida except passing through on the way to someplace else
but
uh-huh
um-hum well most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in florida but i have just that's just not been my thing we used to always head west or head north
now that i'm alone why i prefer to travel overseas if i'm going anywhere
and
course there too you never know what the weather's going to be when you start getting over to
oh is that right
yeah
oh is that right
smaller classrooms possibly
exactly
and i'm i think back and i don't feel like i could have learned a lot more and don't feel like i learned as much
i've only been out of school high school for four years but i think i could have learned a lot more and i've i worry about the children that are in
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know i know with i think teachers need to be paid more i have a lot of friends who and myself who've thought about
going into elementary education and to teaching and then they looked and saw how much money they got and said well there's a lot of other things i can do and get a lot more money
uh-huh
exactly
and i mean their day doesn't end you know when schools out
uh-huh
i mean they go home and grade papers lesson plans prepare for the next day
i'm an interior design major
yep so
exactly in may
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think that's about it you too
yeah
really
yeah
oh i know it
yeah i've seen that just in the last even five years how much they've increased in use or probably eight years when i was a freshman in college
my degree was in computer
technology originally and it seemed like it would they were just getting out with the you know the disks and all that getting away with the cards
you know doing away with the programming cards and
i know
no
i think tv has a lot to do with changes too don't you in like people's attitudes
yeah
oh
yeah
and now everybody has vcrs and two or three vcrs
and that kind of thing
yeah i know
yeah and you can you can flip through the commercials so you don't have to watch the commercials
that's always convenient
so what was their question about decline in
yeah
well
i don't know
i'd say like in the nineteen seventies you remember how
kids would walk around with am
what do you call those little am radios and now people have jam box with cd players in them you know
and
hand held tvs and car phones
yeah
uh-huh
those are cool
yeah
yeah
where do you think it's where do you think it's going to go in twenty years
yeah
um-hum
wow
um-hum
yeah
i'm curious what was your graduate study in
oh wow
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
um-hum
do you think that's caused a lot of pressure on like younger kids today to make choices that they probably shouldn't have to make
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
oh yeah
it's kind of scary when i think of what will happen in twenty years you know when i have kids and they're grown and
just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more so seems like it can't get much worse
yeah
um-hum
hm
yeah
so
sounds like america's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and
worldwide communication and
yeah
yeah
it's pretty wild
uh-huh
yeah
sure do
huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
i know that's what my family was talking when i picked up and moved to texas from indiana and they were like well you know thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that you know
and especially come home every couple months
you know
and
no but my husband's mother was in a nursing home
and she was in there she got sick
and they put her in a nursing home because you couldn't we couldn't afford a nurse
you know all day nurse
yeah well at least as they told us two shifts
you know that's sixteen hours because one would come in the morning and one would be at night i mean in the afternoon and then that night it wouldn't need one
you know because she would be sleeping so i would be here then
well the nursing home is covered by social security see
and the nurses aren't no
see you have to pay that
and oh yeah if you put nursing home and that's another thing i
you know you got to find a good nursing home is very hard to find because the people don't care most of them don't care some of them do care
the work that you know the nurse aide that what the problem is i think it's the nurses' aide they don't pay them enough to keep them there
and to do the things that they need to do
uh-huh
oh yeah it's gets bad some of them and then it depends on the nursing home and how bad it is
you know because they have some nursing home that don't have anybody that's not
walking you know
and it just depends on how bad that person is
yeah
you ought to do your job
and if you can't if you can't i think they should get out of it instead of mistreating the people
well
they yeah that and they steal
oh yeah i used to take every week you know i have to threaten it which it doesn't make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten people that work there
you know like i bring her i bought her a blanket and i had this girl hand crocheted her a lap blanket you know because she sits in a wheel chair but she can walk they just sit them in wheel chairs
and i told her i came up there the following week and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here
because they went to the washer we didn't find it i said you all better find it
and you know her bedspread i took her a bedspread because a comforter because she was always cold
huh-uh
yeah well see this one i is more or less first hand you know she just died
we buried her february but she had been in there at least i know
seven years eight years
and he didn't want to put her in there but he can't afford it
and that's another thing you know
but you don't it depends on when didn't you have a choice the only thing i can say is you have a choice of where they go sometimes
sometimes you don't
and then you have to check out the nursing home and the only way you're going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them in there and check on them every time but don't tell the people
yeah
you have to do one of them you know spontaneous things like maybe three o'clock in the afternoon or one o'clock in the afternoon and stuff like that because they're not expecting you
you know they expect you like on saturdays friday you know saturdays and sundays and friday and stuff but not during the week
hum-um
it gets bad it is nursing home i think is sometimes i think some people put them in there and then they just die that's about what it's for
and it's really not some people don't need to be in there
that's right and i don't think that's right i think they should have a place to some of the people that don't need to be in the nursing home with nurses they need to have a place for them like a retirement home
yeah
don't
yeah
and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each one of them every day you know go by and see what they need
little place to live you know even just a little room
or whatever
sometimes yeah it depends on the patient
and i guess sometimes the availability of that of the room and how they done built the hospitals
because i know one lady like she had a roommate but the woman across the hall didn't have one
get my purse
but it you know it just to me nursing homes are
bad news unless you can find a really good one
and those are rare but there are some good ones and there are some bad ones
i told my husband well is this weird because see what people don't understand is even the people that work in the nursing home they will get old one day
and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them that's the way i feel yeah
or maybe that won't not make it that far in life
for what they did to somebody but
that's the whole that's what i think i think god will definitely get you know
there's two people that i know you should not mess abuse and that's a child and a person that's elderly you shouldn't abuse anybody but down right
them people them two people are the most helpless people you see what i'm saying
you know they can't really defend themselves like somebody say my age you know you know yeah
because i can tell somebody to go leave me alone
but they so old
yeah
you can force their hand more or less but see somebody that old they don't know
and then what they what are they going to do and if they tell anybody people always say oh they're just senile
so
it gets bad you know it just depends on like i said the nursing home now my grandmother was in a nursing home in california
before she died but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones
but now my mom and them had to pay for that too
you have to pay more you know social security covers so much and then you have to pay some more and she chose to pay some more
if she you know since it was like my grandmother had
thirteen kids so they all you know paid their month
yeah
if yeah see and then there's another thing she told me is you have to make sure everybody cooperates because like by her being there if someone if one of her brothers didn't send in their check
she would have to pay it
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
just pretty
oh yeah see that's what that's what gets me like well just like my brother he has got his five bedroom house
in california with the swimming pool and here i am renting a house barely making it
um-hum
yeah
you know but not him he's never happy and i think that's why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more
which i probably if i got what i wanted i'd be okay
you know
um-hum
um-hum
do you have gang problems
well i'm a school principal
um-hum elementary school
well its elementary school
elementary but i have gang problems
um-hum
i'm in a part of dallas where there's a lot of gang activity and my i have through the sixth grade
but some of my sixth graders will be thirteen fourteen years old
and they get recruited
so
we have really very significant problems
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
i spent a week on the brigham young campus at a workshop
and it was very
dramatically different that the people you saw than what we see here because you had no minorities you know and
um-hum
um-hum
hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
but of course you have a lot of parents that are not really parenting much
you have that in utah
you have that in utah
because i would think that big mormon influence there would
um-hum
well i work in an area of town like my school
is about seventy five percent anglo and that's very unusual in the in the dallas public schools
but it's very it's like the lowest socioeconomic anglos
yeah it's what in the south we call poor white trash
and then the other significant percentage i have is hispanic
and course that's growing
but the kids that i have
the biggest discipline problems with are anglo children
and i i've got lots of anglo children who are just
not really wanted by anybody
well and for example i have a boy now he checked out today
he's fourteen he's in the sixth grade he lived with his mother in mississippi he had been to he thought ten or twelve schools in mississippi
then his mother now his mother and father aren't divorced but they don't live together in a long time his mother had a new boyfriend who moved in who owed so much back child support for his children
that they couldn't afford to keep her children anymore so they sent them here
and here he was with his father and his father's pregnant girlfriend
and they pawned all his personal belongings like he had a nintendo and a vcr and some stuff they pawned that
and he's just been tearing my school up and he told me he's gonna be bad enough to be sent back to mississippi
and today they checked him out to send him back to mississippi
now those kids
yeah but
yeah but those kids are
ready fodder for gangs
sure they belong gives them something to belong to gives them identity gives them importance
gives them a certain security
and
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah i agree with you i a group that i'm a part of goes once a month to a
they call it the heritage house it's a nursing home for elderly people and this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape a lot of them have had
limbs amputated or have serious illnesses you know that kind of thing and
i watched the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands it started out just being a terrible place for the people and then a new company bought it
and came in and remodeled the whole place hired new nurses and just really just redid it you know
well to me it was dirty for one thing when you would walk in the smell was just awful though you know the floors you could just
of course i don't know how many of them were you know just not in their right mind or how many were
you know yeah i just really don't know but i feel like they were neglected and
right
right
right i don't really think anyone was being you know cruel or trying to mistreat them or anything i just think they were
just not doing anymore you know than they had to do and just kind of letting everybody live
but this new company came in and they like i said they remodeled the place and it smells nice when you walk in and it looks nice and
they got like several new color tv's for the people and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more interesting place for them to be they made a little patio area where they can go outside and
yeah just you know just small things that make it seem a lot more
yeah and it's like it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just horrible
right
right
right
uh-huh
right
right with nothing you know
yeah
right
right
right
yeah
well they this place that we visit it's really neat they have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in and
they will do bingo our group does a church service once a month and then other groups come in and do the services you know other sundays so that they have at least one service every sunday and
so there are a lot of things there are places that have a lot of things for them to do
but you really do have to kind of seek it out you know and
yeah it is it's real nice and i know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches and they are just like civic organizations that do
and i have other friends it's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up and
make sure it's a friendly animal you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do so
yeah it there's a lot that can be done it's just a matter of people not being lazy
and you know doing the best they can but again i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know that would be
right yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah i would too
yeah right yeah
yeah i know i know what you mean
yeah well i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because
many of them of course their minds are not good
and so a lot of them have told me exactly the same story you know every time i visit them
they'll tell me they'll reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go it's the same thing you know but
just somebody to listen to them just seems to really make them feel good
and if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it and oh he's always got a smile i mean he really tries to
to brighten up your life oh it's just amazing but he can't say anything he can just kind of make noises you know
yeah
yeah
me too
yeah uh-huh
i know
i know
i know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh it does yeah
yeah it is it's really hard and
but the one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids i have a three year old and a six year old and they
have gotten comfortable being around these people because they've always gone with us
and the people love them and
they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand and so far my kids will do it just real easily
and i think it's because they've gone since they were real little and they've never been afraid but that's something to me children
uh-huh
yeah
that's true
yeah
yeah well me too
yeah it's quite an experience
yeah there are and it really helps those people i think
but like you said i'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there i
would be a last resort
yeah
yeah that's right
well
yeah you too tonya thanks for calling bye
well do you have time to read the paper in the morning
you know a lot a lot of people don't take newspapers at all we took the morning news for a while and then well we've been taking the times herald for ages and then
dog just ran off with my shoe that's off the subject
went outside picked it up and ran off anyway and then we switched the morning news but we found we couldn't read enough of it and by the time i got home and had time to
to read some but i guess the issue is beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines
did you did you hear what schwartzkopf had to say about pete arnett and the news coverage
well any you know time magazine and even the news that sometimes that that's why i like some diversity the idea that i we have time which we take from time to time
garland daily news i guess it's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or but i think what's interesting is that if you're that there this
as difficult as he is or as much as they try they put some bias i had the chance to hear tracy rowlett speak to a group and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial
and that but and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is and
yes
a ploy which was i find that fascinating that
i listen to krld and klif the news talk radio and i actually listen to cnn radio do you know it was on radio now
well when i go to work i listen
yeah
well with your you know if you're around the home though and can watch tv and read the paper the problem is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is and then they start repeating everything
and so it's kind of a oh that's what's interesting is the cnn i don't think i'm trying to think if it's much local i listen to a little of that and i listen to a little of ninety point one i i'm inveterate switcher
that ninety eight point seven i'm eclectic approach
well i watch channel five but that has to be that's another bias that has to do with the weather reporting i'm not sure that actually i think channel eight is probably but i know dave fox he goes to our church so
well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago dave fox and tracy rowlett came together from oklahoma city and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then
they've been some people move around and john chriswell is anyway the i don't know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio tv stations
yeah and i think he has legitimate argument i mean you can i grew up in alabama and so i have some prejudices
but i think that i think that from a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station i'm not sure i i'm
totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but i think that in some cases there should be some real opportunity and some diversity and
and this kind of thing and i think that dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good i occasionally go to saint louis and there for a few days and watch the news and i think dallas really does have
have quite good news i think channel eight is the number one abc affiliate in the us i think tracy rowlett was saying that he course he pumping his own
where'd you move from
it is interesting though it becomes a little of personality in fact the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that twenty one twenty three years ago or so
twenty four anyway long time ago and shortly after i got we got here fourteen years ago
and i think if we remember that they're out after the ratings
and some well it's like the dale hansen on channel eight is a sometimes a little too cutesy but i wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes
okay well good talking to you good night
the reason i ask is the last two conversations i've had or have been out of state
i see
oh well you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood
you probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow
yeah
well that's good i
i have lived
in texas essentially all my life and around in texas and
i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it but
i don't know i'm not sure i would want to take on those winters i'm getting older and
not sure that's really something i wanna do
i live over in the lake highlands area if you're familiar with that
okay you
this is pretty well where lbj and audelia skillman cross
we're just north of
white rock lake
well we have some very nice homes here in this area
my particular i guess they want us to describe the area so my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million
yes
the homes that were
as they've developed the land and of course it's pretty static right now and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy
how about you
okay
okay
um-hum
okay
yes those are over a million
well we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in dallas not as bad as houston
well now do you live in a home or a zero lot home or
okay
oh
well your was your house in good shape was it damaged
oh it was oh
i see
yes i
am familiar with that i where i live is a house that's seventeen years old when i bought it
and we bought it from someone who was in it but before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it had it had sat empty for the better part of a year
and i'm not sure what happened but i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for about four years
i
i found a lot of things
oh
hello i'm so sorry that was my daughter's brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow brownie meeting
you had eight boys and one girl
because with utah and the large family
and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled
no usually busy fighting for survival
well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here
that i think
i teasingly i talk to parents about this a lot children i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home
need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family
and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home i really believe that
and it has
helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age and i think our kids are real secure
and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's
i really think it's true for our family and i think it has worked very well
there's no question i think that's really the best if a woman is happy doing that i hate to put it quite that way
i was twenty nine when i had my first child and i would not have
been real fulfilled i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child it's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother but
i liked i like the way i did it i sort of worked half time i had very flexible hours
and i think we choose very carefully the alternative situations that we had them in
oh yeah hope so your wife does she work right now
she's out
so you're still trying to dry out
i said one thing we've been doing around here is trying to find ways of having
get's to be a real chore with little kids who basically want every thing covered in cheese
i just have been fortunate with that i have never really had an ice cream fetish but i'm married to somebody who just feels that you know if you offer it to him he'd eat a hot fudge sundae every night of the week
and i hate him for it
oh yeah
wow
uh-huh
give me something that's really easy to do
i love clams but i'm not sure what clams casino are and i don't know if i could find clams that i would eat down here in texas
uh-huh
uh-huh
god that sounds good
uh-huh
now in texas it would have to be ten fifteen
god that sound wonderful
well i'll give you one that i put together modified out of a heart smart cookbook
now my husband really thinks that this is one of those fancy french sauces
the like the center cut pork chops
and you need to have them thick at least a three-quarters of an inch think
and all you do is take those things and coat them in lemon pepper marinade
on both sides
no just the you know you can do that just the stuff that you buy just lemon pepper
and then you take about two tablespoons of butter
and you just melt that in a skillet
you brown the pork chops or the pork fillets
you just brown them on both sides and i like to get them at a good golden brown
and then just take them and stick them on a plate and keep them warm and into that same skillet add the juice of lemon about anywhere from a quarter to a half a cup
to that you add two tablespoons of worcestershire sauce
and one teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on how much you like it
yeah worcestershire
and then
anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon of dijon mustard
and what you do is you just cook this down and it makes a really pretty almost dark black brown viscous sauce
it's pretty spicy now i like to throw in just a you know a shot of white wine
and then you just take the pork chops put them on a serving platter pour this sauce over it and i garnish it with fresh cut chives
it really is a really pretty entree to look at
uh-huh and the sauce i mean it has kind of this nice complex flavor where you feel that somebody's you know played around with this all afternoon
and i have served it to company
and
uh-huh
but you know the trick with pork most people think you have to cook it at a hundred and eighty five degrees well done
you don't have to do that
it can still be pink in the middle and that makes all the world of difference
the other thing that i've really got into down here in texas is ah fresh herbs
oh yeah
well see i don't have to try them cause they'll pretty much you know grow all winter long and if
oh i don't know we also have you know foot long roaches all year long too
don't laugh but what makes a really elegant just a side dish and most people don't have any idea what it is why they don't i don't know and you can make it a day ahead of time
because i just take about a cup of fresh cut basil i mean i really like basil
add and i add almost equal parts parmesan cheese
a healthy balance of garlic i mean i really like garlic
yeah so you're basically making a kind of a pesto
yes but if you serve it cold it really is just a wonderful
it really is nice
and even my kids will eat it
and they've gotten to be kind of food snobs one of them went over to
dry basil doesn't have quite the taste
yeah i keep i do that and i find that it tastes just about as good
and i freeze it in like little half cup quantity so i can even pull it out whenever i want to
uh-huh
you know what also is really good just really good and really simple if you like to do grilling
if you can get a hold of fresh sage
have you ever worked with that
just take the fresh sage and you know
crumble it so that you release the oils
pour you know put that stuff over fresh pork chops
and if you've got balsamic vinegar there
oh i love that stuff
oh
i do my own vinegars too but just put a touch of balsamic vinegar on that until
yes we currently have three we have two cats and a dog
well they're
the we have a solid black one that's kind of long hair and but he's i don't know he's has a little persian in him but we're not sure how much and
that we inherited the neighbors
persian and when they had to move to a place that wouldn't allow cats so he was like a full blooded persian
and then our dog's a big old golden retriever
how about you have some
and a turtle hm
uh-huh
well we were in we kind of did a did a similar thing we inherited a lizard from my son's class
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yes there is and
uh-huh
it looks siamese yeah
yeah
well we just had a oh it happened about a year ago we had a cat that we had
for twenty years the year we got married we got the cat and she finally died right after christmas a year ago
and that was kind of
a sad parting but she had a little bit of siamese
if you looked at her face you'd picture siamese although she was solid black too but
held or anything like that
uh-huh
yeah
and what kind what kind of dog do you have
oh okay yeah they're friendly too
oh okay
is she a real friendly type of dog
jeez
yes i'm i have some great concerns about my parents and my relatives reaching that age
around here where i live in maryland in the washington area there's and i used to live down in dallas
there was just so many stories about rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions in fact here in baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down
and taken all the people out of them because they were so bug infested and rat infested and it you know really concerns me that
first of all that anyone could let someone live like that but if you have to
you know how do you make sure i mean i'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face
you know how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there
you know they may not like the fact that they've been put in there and they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there and you know
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes that's true my grandmother's last time my mother went down there to visit the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches
that she even you know they went in and she had roaches crawling on her there were roaches even in her alarm clock
yes it was absolutely horrible they took her immediately out of there and they just threw everything away
that she had from there i mean they wouldn't even take the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just you know full of bugs they just left everything
and bought her all brand new stuff and they had called a home where they you know where they were on a waiting list to get into there
and explained to the person that was in charge you know what had happened and that they had they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions and amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening and they put her into that opening
actually i'm sorry not until yeah i guess it was around eighty two eighty three i found out i had a grandmother
prior to that i was told that she was dead and apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who put her into a mental institution
yeah
yes
you know
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and i tell her you know no problem mom always got a place for you but
uh-huh
war and the oil market was very volatile
yeah
yeah
yeah but it it's always kind of i mean and it is something i take a lot of pleasure in i thoroughly enjoy it
you know as current as one can
um-hum
right
yeah well it interesting that you know you mention a small town i have a friend of mine who she's a school teacher
pretty small town i mean we're talking about maybe sixteen thousand people or so and is teaching school there she really does she loves her
her work and she likes living there she said the part of it that drives her crazy is she's accustomed to living in a city and having a big newspaper and she said you know it's the little things
yes
well explain this to me
why do we have sometimes a petit jury isn't it
and a grand jury
all right now when do we have them just in big criminal cases
when you have both like i was called
for a murder trial a few weeks ago
and they had already had one trial and determined that there was enough evidence to go on and have the second one
so is it just murder or what
where you have both
both juries
no they didn't they had one
and decided that there was enough evidence and then
say
huh-uh i don't know and like you said maybe it was just with the judge i don't know
yeah
yeah
well i'll tell you something i think ought to be changed
well they sent out eight hundred summons
and about four hundred people showed up right all the others had gotten out of it
then the judge went on for several hours explaining to us how the law goes
and some of the particulars of the case and then all these people got to stand up if they wanted to get out of it well that was about half of us right stood up and tried to get out
well i mean that took like an hour and a half at least for him to listen to everybody
yeah i've been getting out of it the last few years because i was going to school
you know you can plead that and i had small children but then i found out that you're not supposed to plead that unless you're the care taker you know and i'm not because i have to go to work and then they were going to day care so i shouldn't have been doing that
but anyway
punishment
um-hum
well i believed in it in some you know cases but i would feel that it would be very hard for me to impose it on somebody
i think
okay
um-hum
um-hum
well this guy that was sitting in front of me said that he was a private investigator and he had been tailing the woman that was murdered
and as far as he was concerned that this guy was guiltier than hell now listen to what he supposedly did he supposedly stuffed paper toweling up this women's nostrils and down her throat and strangled her
now how this happened was this rich little socialite in plano down here in texas decided that she was going to bump off her husband's girlfriend because he didn't want to divorce her
and she wanted to get a stab at more money right by knocking him off
so she hired four guys to do it and this guy actually did it
now she in the mean time took off with one of her lawyers who was also under indictment for attempting drug among them
yeah among them cocaine right so they split anyway they got the lawyer and he's now going to side with the cate with the state so that he'll get a lesser sentence
yeah
pretty interesting huh
and decide to call in people two to three at a time
i don't want to be picked
i'm not going to be summoned i mean out of four hundred i'm not going to be one of the twelve especially see i put that down that guy had told me that
but then i've heard that won't make a difference either
yeah
uh-huh
well
what do you think can we change the system
but something ought to be done because if you have money you get a good lawyer and you get off
but if you've got a good lawyer he's going to be able to get more
persuasive evidence than a poor lawyer would to present
and a lawyer that's you know chosen by the state that really doesn't even want to do it
uh-huh
the mavericks they're not doing the greatest that i've seen them play before but well they're doing okay
but
no i think without roy tarpley they're he added something to the team but i think they need to let him go maybe
he doesn't seem to course i have a lot of players that i think are really super i think isaiah thomas is just great and i think he
i guess i like to watch the mailman play for the utah team when he delivers he does okay and
i can't think of the name of the team that has larry bird on it oh the celtics i like to watch them play the whole team i like their whole team
yeah
yeah
um-hum i you know like i said i like isaiah thomas but i think sometimes that
that he sometimes ends up being a one man team whereas the celtics like you said they play more as a team
yeah i like michael jordan a lot too he's really good
danny ainge he i like danny ainge okay
well i
yeah and he played really well when he was there so
portland um-hum right now
yeah they yeah i liked when he was playing with celtics and then he traded to portland
and it was a good trade so
i don't remember i really don't it seems like he went straight there you know because i don't remember him playing for another team other than straight through
yeah
so what's your favorite team
do you have a favorite team yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
i watched well i didn't watch them but i saw in the newspaper and on the news the play-off teams and
and without larry bird and michael jordan when they got injured you know it was interesting i think then how their teams did
how it brought the scoring down a little bit but their teams stayed relatively together you know and so
you know i think sometimes it's interesting we really watch the big name players and but they have to have a solid team underneath or else they really don't go anywhere
so i think that's kind of the mavericks problem they have okay players but sometimes the strongness of the team isn't together
you know every once in a while they click during a game and then it works for them but then it's just not always there
yeah
english did okay he did okay
but
oh
i think adubato as the coach of their team has done a lot for them
i think he he's brought some strength to that team
he he's really trying hard he's a nice guy i like him as the coach of the mavericks so
i don't i don't know a lot of coaches in the in the nba though
yeah that's true
yeah that's true that's true
yeah
i think they're i think they'll let him go
anyway i like basketball it's a fun sport i like to watch it i like to
i guess i like it because of the quickness of it and i like it because it takes the players
have to be
you know it's not a game where you can just not practice i mean they have to be on the top of their game to be in the nba i think
yeah or else
yeah
i don't watch too much of that i watch our town plano east is where my children will go i have an eleven year old son and he plays basketball and my husband coaches his team
and they i think they were one off one loss to the play-off
and i like to watch our plano east senior high boys play they are they did really well so yeah
i like yeah i do like the games not only basketball but the other ones too that the high schools play i keep up with that
so
yeah
yeah
well you know what i think is you know like spud webb i mean
you can really even if you're short like that you know in basketball today they get these huge tall players that
that just are you know if you want to do it bad enough i think it's a possibility in anybody's life
i think if any of these boys want to do it they really can if that's really their dream
yeah
well
i just think that basketball's a fun game and i guess i still have to stick with the mavericks i guess as far as
that's okay i'm bill from raleigh
oh so another one from
right
yes and no it wasn't really a planning one but it was kind of it was a birthday and i brought a lot of family together then
it went pretty good i'm i've worked in hotels so i kind of know how to do these things i used to you know
usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and
and it's all of like she comes from a big family she has like seven sisters i think
and they show up and all their kids and then she has i have
like let's see she has four sons and two daughters and
they show up and all their kids so it's a pretty big reunion it's about two hundred people maybe
the probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone
you know could eat comfortably and everything
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that
for the rent we rented like a rescue squad building or something like that and
each one of the everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for
it was kind of potluck you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say
yeah
and of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook
she's eighty six
now she does she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
oh yeah my nickname for her is honey woman that's what i call her
it's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up
my immediate family you know my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever because my dad was in the army and we
i live in raleigh and then my parents live in greenville and i have one brother and his wife live in greenville and another brother that lives in outside of fayetteville so i mean we're
we're spread out but everybody else is centralized in my home town waynesboro so
all right that's a good that's a good topic huh
where did you go on your last vacation
to what
uh-huh yeah
oh yeah
what's your out of the out of the state type where do you like to go
really
what kind of vacation spots are there in colorado
uh-huh
i think my parents took me there when i was real young we went to colorado springs and rocky mountain national park it was real pretty
got to see pike's peak
you drive by yourself up there
oh wow
oh
yeah
sure is pretty up there
you have mountains all around you
where you live
uh-huh
but
have you ever been out of the united states for vacation
or business
uh-huh
i went to
the bahamas last year on a cruise for my honeymoon
which is really neat i had never been out of
really out of texas or indiana much out of the united states
i'm from indiana so
what
yeah it was great
it was really pretty down there
uh-huh yeah really did there in fact one family that
sat at our table every meal was from london and they had never been to the united states so they were really enjoying it and they were telling us about all their trips and
they had been to disneyland and
it was neat to meet different people
uh-huh
oh really i've heard it's really pretty up there
uh-huh
oh
oh wow
uh-huh
pacific sites
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh wow
that would be neat
that's the vacation you recommend huh
yeah
yeah i've heard it is
uh-huh
really
oh wow
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
and your car is on a ferry and it goes across with you
that's really neat
to work
huh
that's really wild
huh
hour and ten minutes
yeah
that's really interesting
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it is
i've been wanting to go to the west texas and see different parts of texas because i haven't lived here very long and i haven't really seen much
so what are some good things in texas to go visit
galveston
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
boardwalk and all that
yeah
i've heard it's really pretty
really
yeah
uh-huh
down by big bend what's that
okay
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
i've heard to go to austin too a lot people say to go down there -t's real
what's there to see in austin
uh-huh
oh preferably mexican food or seafood
oh really hum
wow
yeah
yeah
oh yeah we
we haven't found a you know the are the best mexican food we've found is back in houston
and same goes for the seafood of course to there's not much smack right here out in the middle of nowhere
not close about an hour away in waco there's the closest one
yeah it's been a while since i've been there i was always jumped on the steak whenever i went there
instead of the seafood
yeah
oh
so no i pretty
you know
mexican food or seafood pretty much
i could probably live on that
oh
there you go
yeah
yeah right well what do you like about your chinese food place there that makes you keep going back
uh-huh
oh
oh
yeah
right
yeah
right
yeah
there's a couple places around here that we'll go back to now and again
one being a
a chinese food place and another one being another mexican food place and
and
it just seems that
if the if the help is good and they're like they're supposed to be that you know you're tempted to give the food a second try but not the people for some reason
yeah
yeah
yeah
let's see how long do you eat do you go out once a week
yeah
hum
uh-huh
wow
yeah right so you can't complain about that really
i don't think so i haven't heard of it
oh no
oh
made you reconsider hm
oh
hum
right well that's a good way to go about it
yeah there's kind of a little place set up like that i know that they've got one in austin and san antonio and one in houston it's called you are cook
and that's exactly what you are and it a it turned out it's a cattle rancher who owns the restaurant and has his own cattle so it's an ongoing circle
you know and you get your all your salad and everything for your salad is at one part of the restaurant and then everything for a baked potato and everything you can imagine to put on it is another section and then right smack in the middle is these
three huge grills
that they have set up for the people to use and you go in and you pick out your own selection of meat
that you want to cook you know filet or t bone or whatever it is and they're just huge then there you know there the meat is just massive just massive i think the smallest they have is
i think a nine ounce filet i mean just we're taking doggy bags home every time we go and it's like twelve dollars a person but you are you're getting three or four meals out of it by the time you take it home
yeah you take it up to the grill and you flip it or they'll cook it they'll charge you an extra dollar to cook it for you
yeah it's really a lot of fun because they get up there and
yeah season it and throw it on the grill and
and you know sit around and just talk while it's cooking and some people go back and eat their salads and leave it there most people stay up there so they get to
take their own steak back to their table but it's really neat i never thought it would go over much because nobody you know i don't want to cook my own dinner i want to go out and you know pay for it but it's really a it's really a neat phenomena how it all works out
yeah if you're ever in or around the area do give it a try because it's really good food
yeah i'm not sure where all you know he's texas bound obviously because i haven't heard him go any farther than those three cities but that it's really neat too so
yeah
yeah and it's and i and you know the fact that it's his own cattle it's just an ongoing
right
so
oh yeah i bet you can't get find mexican food over there i had always wondered what i'd do if i lived somewhere other than texas
oh well
hum
i guess so
you too dave you too bye-bye
bridgette this is maureen
yeah if there's something wrong with the school system
sure
right
oh
you there okay
we're not gonna have the kids get any smarter because you know they're not encouraging their kids to do well in school so
otherwise we're not gonna ever achieve a good education system unless we really get the parents involved
um-hum
yeah
right
oh yeah
yeah it's kind of a shame that we don't put emphasis and money where we really should i mean we've never really paid teachers real well
we've never paid other public servants like the police and such very well it is kind of a shame
there are some times i think that you know the quality of teachers may be improved upon i think what they did a few years ago was kind of a joke about testing the teachers and all
the kind of courses that should be involved in education curriculum and trying to improve upon them somewhat but
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
some people you know just really clam up when it comes to a test and they're so nervous about well is there a is this a trick question and instead of being real straight forward and just trying to answer it they
give themselves you know worse grade because they were so anxious about it
and then other people you know aren't that upset about it and they test very well so there has to be
different ways of testing sometimes you know because that isn't always a real good reflection of if the person's learned it or not
i don't know counseling or you know psychologist or just you know talking about how to get along in life if they're not getting that so much from home
i use them carefully i guess
i usually don't i usually use them to consolidate billing
for convenience sakes
but i usually just pay them off at the end of the month
i don't i don't avoid the finance charges as high as they are
i don't
don't
you know i don't
let them carry over you know i
i've been lucky i guess i haven't had a bill big enough where i couldn't pay them off at the end of the month
but i try to try to live within a budget you know and so
i keep that in mind i just don't you know
i guess it takes self-restraint when you have a credit card to know that
that there's you really have to pay these things off
plus a lot more you know and you got to realize that there's only this much money in the bank and if you're going to live
you know
if you're not going to try to you know say well i'll pay it off sometime in the future
um-hum
rip theirs up just because they you know they can't resist them
right
right
um-hum
right
i use them to float sometimes if it's near the end of the month and you know and you know i don't have a check coming in a few days
i'll go ahead and charge it knowing that the money will be there
by the time the bill comes
uh-huh right you know we go out to eat a lot of times
i don't like to carry a lot of cash with me
so i just carry my credit card and for things like that
it's a
and yeah i have i have what i have two credit cards that's all i use i'm always getting stuff in the mail all the time
you are a preferred such and such and you are
you're already approved to
i
oh
sometimes they just send them to you and say here have a credit card
is that right
huh i didn't know that
that you didn't want
is that right
huh
that's right that's right they could they can make your life miserable if they want to
is that right
we don't have too many exxon stations out this way
we've got lots of mobil
mobils are big and
we have a few exxon we've got some other ones like citgo
yeah is a is a one
yeah
got some shell stations
a few texaco stations
uh-huh
right
and there's another local one i can't i can't remember what there's some few sinclair stations
yeah the few they're the green dinosaurs are
their
yeah there's not that many down here that you know once
once in a while you'll see one
i guess they're still in business
yeah
yeah
you ever you ever gotten in trouble with your credit card where they they've charged you for something you didn't
didn't purchase
yeah i have
uh-huh
um-hum
right
right
from someone saying
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh somebody blew it
right
right
do you have the discover card
either do i
they i don't know i don't know how anybody can fall into this you get cash back and buy into that because
all they're giving you back is a little bit of the interest you paid in
yeah their interest
right their interest rate's twenty two percent
higher than any other ones and then they said that we'll give you back some of your money
like
right
it it's a rip-off
but a lot of people think it's wonderful i guess said they're doing well everything i've read they've been getting a more market share i guess they're advertising and promotions and
yeah i guess so
i don't know
yeah
um-hum
yeah i have a on my credit cards i have a grace period if i pay it off within when the bill comes i don't have to owe any interest
and
right
um-hum
yeah once in a while
where they extend the warranty
then
and everything huh
uh-huh
he pays for that yeah a couple hundred bucks probably for that like high end card
get what you pay for huh
for that little
right
yeah
um-hum
right
right
right
uh-huh yeah a lot of people do that for a living i guess
trade money
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum
right
the other check went through
made a little extra money there huh
i live in dallas
it's no it's called 635's the highway it's the looper that goes around the city and then the tollway is called the dallas north tollway just moved here about
oh one about a month ago after twenty one years two miles to the east
so it's a very different house from the typical dallas
house
it's about eight years old it's a duplex type thing very modern and very open and airy light
so it's different than the long texas ramblers um-hum
what's your house like
oh great yeah
so it's got a lot a openness and light also
oh it doesn't well that's what my wife really wanted and so
yeah that's
our last house wasn't too bad but it was just too traditional and so if
the next time probably a year and a half from now we're gonna try to build
so make one really contemporary and very modern and very open and very light
no i have three in college they usually get back for the least two of them for the summer so
but
still need a little bit of space we have a lot less than we had recently already cut back
how big is your place
yeah we had
yeah we had four bedrooms two and a half baths in the place we just left
so now we're down to two and two
um-hum so it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home but it won't be that long because we not for sure you know how long they're gonna stay or whatever
oh yes and if you can get in the if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal
we really didn't go that route and didn't look but
the plenty of them and the and the housing market probably still gonna even go lower there are many houses for sale just by the regular route
so
yeah and we just decided sell and we got we got a pretty good price for what we had not as good as it would've been
say three or four years ago but
that
um-hum
oh
well yeah they're not moving very well for sure
and that's a good
example of it
oh yeah i know where that is i've been we've been here twenty five years i'm from missouri and my wife's from kansas so
i teach at a college here so it's
it's sort of home now
so
i'm one of the it's called brookhaven college it's one of the community colleges
and it's just about two miles to the west of where i'm living so it's very nice very convenient
yeah now richland college is out it serves richardson and garland and that's about nine miles to the east of here so
anyway well it's good to hear from you and i hope we hope we did them some good on their little computer dealie and
considering some of the things we picked up i think it's i think it means as much to get a clean one i think being able to prove that you're clean is quite beneficial to the employee
i know our company requires it before employment and then if there's an accident on the job they require it
and i does your company do the same
on a accident
yeah
okay
well we hope they are at ours too but that's just in our policy and procedures
but we i think in a in a way it's a protection for the employee
yeah
oh well i think
the sensitiveness of either one of other professions requires complete ability to think properly
and with even with the money we charge for it
not at all but we do have in our particular facility we have a special area
well oh well all you have to do is go in and give a specimen then go on your merry way
yeah don't have to worry about it
oh well
well yeah there's some of the tests that i think still we have a right to privacy
right first i had this young lady read it i said i want you to be sure and read this before you sign it
she read it she said i think i'll go call my lawyer
she came back in and she says i don't think i want this and i said i thought didn't think you might but you sign away your rights
oh yeah
well they do that to some extent already
right
we could
well
um-hum we do them for the people i have a have a program where we can do them for the individual
yeah they're not doing too good this year they're they kind of started off with a rocket there at the beginning not at not at a season but i mean just when just in general
just kind of come down to an even slump but they're not doing too good this year
oh yeah oh yeah
yeah i'm kind of surprised that they that they that they hung onto him as long as they did
oh they gave him more than more than more than i would have
oh yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't have put up with it after the second time i'd have said get out of here
oh i know it you follow the mavericks
yeah
how's the jazz doing this year
are they
well that's good
huh-uh
whoa
no kidding
my goodness
right
yeah that's for sure
yeah i didn't even hear i didn't even hear but i haven't picked up a paper probably or a sports page in
yeah i haven't had a chance to so
yeah just been extremely busy but no i didn't i didn't even hear about that i didn't even see it on the news so i must have missed that one altogether
oh especially excessive violence where somebody gets hurt especially oh it's just so but we're raised on that
everybody's raised on that
on the negatives of life i guess
oh yeah
yeah i heard those
yeah
might as well
as far as magic
yeah but he's paying pretty hard
well yeah that's true
yeah that's true he definitely he definitely opened it up and showed a different side of it
i don't think they'll hold together
no i believe you're right
i believe you're right
no that's about it i just i mean when it gets down to the end of the season if the mavericks are doing good i'll stay up with them but yeah i i'm dedicated to a point
you know just like i'm more dedicated in football i guess than anything
well yeah well i was raised on the cowboys so
i mean the mavericks are
yeah that was years ago though
that was that was i guess the original pro team that
that they had here
yeah
right that a that a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not and
i was trying to remember back it seems to me that you know when i studied civics in school or stuff that this
the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't so much and i'm trying to
figure out whether that's i'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state
yeah
yeah and
yeah i certainly wouldn't be worried about that i guess in terms of the
in terms of doing away with the with the unanimous jury i guess i guess i
i don't know where you'd where you'd draw the line anywhere else you know two thirds or three fourths or whatever but
and i certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a just a bare majority
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well and i'm i'd i know it is i know it is where i where i work but i'm not sure that that's
that that's necessarily required you know by law that it has to be paid
i suspect that's a that's a
benefit of a bigger company but there are certainly some
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well the i guess i haven't had that much experience i've only seen like my great grandparents in a nursing home but
i have an aunt who lived on her own -til she was well in her nineties and then she got sick and she ended up in a nursing home
and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep
nice sedative state
uh-huh
yeah
be violent
was this in a big town or a little town
oh really
it seem like the small town nursing homes
i there's a lot more personal attention
uh-huh you have more options
uh-huh
yeah i watch a lot of television myself here lately i'm out of a job right now so
yeah
and generally the channel eight stuff that comes on doogie howser and roseanne and
stuff like that
a real favorite
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i never was much of a dynasty fan
yeah
okay
thank you bye
um-hum
um-hum
well i know they were gonna start one but i haven't heard any more since so i don't really know but as far as personally doing something no
how about you
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah huh
oh i'm sure it is
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
kids that are bored like you say
uh-huh
oh no
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh i know it hm
um-hum
um-hum
yeah huh
yeah
yeah it is it really is
like i say now i don't think necessarily in this area here but
just dallas in general i don't know i think back of when i was younger and in my party days some of those things
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
um-hum
yeah hm
hm
actually we live out in gainesville virginia and my wife is originally from the bronx
so for the longest time we didn't have any kind of crime protection on our house at all because we lived way out in the country here
and then you know over the years we visited her folks and her folks have probably the most impressive crime reduction system i've ever seen on any house you know they have grates across every single window
they have probably three or four dead bolts on every door
and we just had a guy come out a locksmith come out and put all those on as well as sort of reinforce all of our dead bolts and put new locks in on some doors and fix our french doors up so that they were
you know secure
so
yeah
yeah what's it like in dallas
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
oh man
incredible
yeah
yeah
yeah it's clearly i mean it's they're not in category of business criminals i mean there's
you know then there's then there's the really random acts of violence we actually had a woman who was very close to our house which sort of inspired my wife to you know beef up our own security measures here
she was a couple of houses away and her husband travels a lot and is gone you know for weeks on end
and she was upstairs with her child and heard somebody say hello from downstairs
so she immediately calls 911
and the prince william county police come over and of course the woman kept her on the phone the whole time which i thought was a really good security measure because
so anyway the police showed up and they told her the person on the phone told her to run you know take the child and run downstairs and to let the police in because they were at her front door
and so she did that and when she opened the front door she'd just bought this new german shepherd puppy which had apparently you know gone all over the floor
so the policeman stepped into the front door and actually started sliding around on you know the dog mess
and she yelled simultaneously yelled look out
which the policeman thought was like somebody's about to shoot me
so you know he's like spinning around in this stuff you know i mean it's a pretty comical scene but anyway when the guy finally regained his balance you know he just like get out of house lady and stop trying to help me
but anyway later on it's gonna it's she they didn't find anything i mean apparently you know if the guy came in he ran out and the police tried to convince her that it was the dog playing with the remote control on the tv which just doesn't make any sense at all
too the odds of that are just really unlikely but i actually went over
about a week later he was back home and she was on travel and he locked himself out and i went over and within i would say about five seconds got into their garage door
well i could pick country music
as i've gotten older i've started listening more to the words of music and to the softer melodies
not originally
georgia
if you had to pick one what would you choose
well i understand what you're saying i think if you would listen to it a little you would discover that it has a lot of roots
from the both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that we both lived through
well there's some joy in it also
but mostly it just tells a story about life
i don't know i'm not all that familiar with her work
well i kind of like
i like
groups
like the statler brothers
and
the judds certainly
reba mcintire is a little
too country for me
the
that's true
oh yes that's certainly where her roots are
very much so
that's true
well it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a record of the rap songs of the eighties
yeah
that's true
yeah
right
of course
well the big key is that i think you've already stated that all music is rooted in the classics and it has grown from there
well listen i have to run i hate to cut this short
all right
you bet
bye-bye
oh did you
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah that's true are you a member of a club or anything is that where you go lift weights are you a member of a club or
uh-huh
oh that's great uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh
huh i've been i'm more i've never
seriously lifted weights i wrestled in high school and i couldn't and they always made us and i hated it and stuff hadn't done it since but
now i'm just more of a recreational sport player i don't really do much exercising other than i play softball five or six nights a week and
some basketball but i've god i've never since high school i don't think i've been on a serious
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
well are you are you doing it yeah it's true are you running for serious or you just running to kind of get through for the fun of it or do they
are you
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i'll bet
no
oh really just in muscle though
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
so how often you go and lift then do you do it daily or
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well that's great yeah i i'm trying to like i said i play softball of course not in the winter up here but i usually do something for about two months just to get me in shape for that i do a lot of sit-ups and push-ups but
i still like i say the running and i've we've been meaning to buy some mountain bikes i hard part about me for running is just i don't
you see the same thing you never go far enough to see anything really different and i like the change of scenery and stuff so that's why i was thinking of my wife and i about getting a bike for each of us and then you know we you can go
we live right close by them we i live right at the base of the wasatch mountains here and so i close enough that we there's trails and everything all of the way around and that we can go up and use and we go camping quite a bit and we take them with us you know we take them with us there so
there's a lot of area we can go in up around there i have just one little daughter
you know and actually that's my exercise now just trying to keep up with an eighteen month old that's more than enough so
yeah
uh-huh
good idea
uh-huh
yeah
so how do you keep up with the news
do you read the newspaper
what daily
is that there in your city
so
do you think you get anything from your local newspaper
yeah i don't i'm not exactly sure how good the national news is though how accurate exactly
fear
or where they're at with the news or something along those lines
yeah a little bit of color or something for
the lack of total information that was given on the tv lack they give immediate for the lack of total
well
rather biasedly i believe huh very pro city
for the city fathers but
it seems almost as though they don't
care about how the national news affects the local area
yeah and then they give you just the local o bits and that's it
and
and well hell you don't know those people that died or what from
well what i mean is do you if your in a strange city you certainly don't know them
i work for texas instruments
yes and yourself
yeah i understand
huh that's interesting i've always considered myself
how is this best put
the charles bollfield trash
grew up in west texas thank you
yeah
so do you think our local do you think our national news tells us anything important
yeah i watch sixty minutes
almost religiously
well and
and more importantly than that i wonder how
the other side of the story is
and of course they're not going to tell the other side of the story and they're not going to tell it accurately
we don't we don't have cable
yeah we've watched little bits here and there during the gulf crisis and we
i didn't i wasn't exactly sure how accurate it was either
the incorrect side
i i'm not sure how to phrase that
delicately
yeah it is
i didn't feel comfy you know i you know you always hear about the warm fuzzy feeling
i kept watching that
be it cnn in a bar or local news at home or federal news at home or see
and but on occasion more than occasionally we'll buy the local paper
and
that warm fuzzy that we're talking about i never could get that warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of my stomach about
are these people really telling me the truth or more importantly all the truth
well i'd suspect that to be true but you couldn't prove it to me
and
most importantly i
couldn't believe any of those people
they didn't
seem believable
oh all four well we have the independent here and we've got the three majors and pbs and we watched
all four of those and on more than occasionally i went to a bar that had cnn running around the clock
and
still i got this feeling as though
from these six or eight news sources i had that something was missing
and
oh storming norman
oh of course and you've got to expect that
but i had the feeling
that no matter who i listened to it wasn't that they weren't telling me the truth i felt that someone was lying to me
and
there's nothing there still at this state that i can put my finger on and say oh here's where they lied to me
just a feeling
and more importantly
wouldn't it be nice in this land of the free and home of the brave
if there were never again be any misinformation
um-hum
well it becomes sort of a topic where i sit there and i have a knee jerk reaction and then i have a reaction after i think about it a little longer
for me i guess i feel like we have that we when we give in on these things we tend to move towards a
a society where everything is a is regulated
i think you're right about certain jobs and certainly something like a bus train pilots
it's obviously something that's a necessity it because it because the function of the job is within all pretty much everyone in the world
would admit to the fact that these drugs might impair their abilities
okay
and like so i guess in some ways i'm agreeing with you
that those would be something that should continue to have drug testing of course it is certainly not acceptable for an eastern pilot to
have just had eight martinis before he went off to fly
right
um-hum
i think it might be inappropriate for us to say for me to say that in any in any industry
something see you're talking about a plant where okay if you're a nuclear inspector
or where you're a person who works on safety features for nuclear inspection well that makes sense
but we're talking about you know you're saying well and i think you that you just stated the same thing that if you were a you know a clerical person there or you were a secretary there now where's the justification
not that anyone ever does it but you were smoking pot now how is that going to make any difference
you know unless you unless you pcp does exist apparently in the blood stream
for a long period of time but the ability for you to function seems to be
very it it's very questionable as to whether it has any real effect upon you
right
and the place i just transferred jobs not too long ago and so i went through the whole process and the
there's really no justification what so ever for why i had to do it i mean
it's a company that
it's basically a oh
management engineering company
now
they should also right what they should also regulate how many hours of sleep i must have they should also regulate how much what kind of nutrition i have they should also see it's a it's a it's a disturbing trend
right
um-hum
yeah i just bought a car
i got a nineteen eighty three cavalier station wagon
well a friend of my father's and he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great
it's like it has a hundred and fifty three thousand
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
hm
well it's i didn't really need power windows but it has power you know windows and steering and air conditioning and
um-hum oh yeah it has a stereo and a cassette player and it he's told me it gets forty two miles to gallon
um-hum
so
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum it's really humid
right
um-hum
crank yeah um-hum
right
you don't have to stretch
that's true
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
right
yeah like you said antilock brakes and air bag and i'd really like to have a car that's dependable
that you drive you know like a
american made car that's as dependable as mercedes or something you know
um-hum
yeah they have parts uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
yes we really do because even today it's supposed to get up into the nineties so
um-hum
oh
it was nice talking to you
yeah have a nice summer
yeah bye
yeah well i can tell you here's an interesting story my wife when we first had our kids decided to home school our kids
yeah it's interestingly there're a couple of different categories of home school children
a lot of people take religious exemptions
and those are the people you probably read about all the time in the news you know somebody's trying to you know get rid of evolution or something and
because we both had advanced degrees and so we just said hey look you know we have enough education to school our kids
and the idea was when we first started was to just do elementary school level instead of the public schools and do that at home eight six eight seven and four
so pretty young kids and so anyway my wife did all of this all of this schooling
and you know she had curricula that she bought that they actually sell which we never knew of
you know it was really complete i mean it matched up pretty well with actually i thought was better than a lot of the public school curricula but
anyway you know you could if you were really religious of course you could get all sort of a religious stuff with all the creation and stuff slant on it
but there's actually a lot of to us anyway there's a lot of other good stuff out there too
so we got a couple actually bought a couple of these programs and for grades you know one through six
yeah exactly
and so you know went through it
and anyway my wife got to the third grade point with my with my daughter
the oldest one the eight year old
got to the third grade point
and it was just too much i mean it was just the kids were just
you know they needed they just needed other kids to be learning with you know and also it was a tremendous amount of work
right
exactly
now it was easier it was actually easier as the younger ones got older because she could just you know kind of take what she had before just the same the same thing that public school teachers do now i mean the
but it
she did it for three years
and actually the kids did really you know if you if you believe the tests that the state hands out here you know they're supposed to test your
yeah
right they took a standardized test and
they always did really well and they never seemed to have any problem with it
but i can see in a lot of cases like we didn't in a case where you've got people at home where they don't for you know almost the you know political reasons or whatever they don't want their kids to go to school
i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because we knew people in the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters and i mean if their kid didn't do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know
oh no they sent them to you
yeah so you know for us we actually sat our kid down and timed them and everything you know just make it seem like the real pressure you'd be under
we did that yes that was the reason but we did that out of total ignorance
it was just sort of it was just sort of you know hey we remember what public school was like and it was really crappy my wife actually was she's from the bronx in new york so you know
she knew that public schools could be pretty bad
and
yeah
you know my opinion is that they should there should be a public school
they shouldn't make everybody go to it i mean you should be able to go to other schools or if you know if people have the credentials to home school well leave them alone but you know as far as the taxes go i mean i don't yeah big deal nah
right
hello
hi
i'm sandy i'm in texas too
yes
yeah
okay
yeah
so am i
i you know i think it's kind of coming back around to that don't you i mean that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before but
i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do you know
i don't know i mean i think sometimes some of the women's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all you know and you can't have everything
i don't i don't think that you can have i mean there's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i wanna be
and to me that's more important
two
um-hum
five and two
well i agree i mean but i hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you know you should stay home you know otherwise your children aren't going to you know turn out or whatever because that's not fair to
you know like the single moms that have to work or if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet
not working or whatever i mean i think it's got to be a personal choice and
it's nice that we could have the choice to stay home
yeah
well and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or you know even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff and i think that's really important
that they do that and they realize there's a need for that and
i don't know i found when i did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work and it wasn't where i had to be there every day but
i mean we're going to the doctor once a week so i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor
well my weather right now is rainy this is the most rain i think we've ever seen over a twelve month period of time since i moved to the texas area
oh my uh-huh
uh-huh oh this is this is a neat you missed the nineteen eighty one mess
the nineteen eighty summer that about roasted everybody and then the eighty one spring that where practically every lake in north texas overflowed
i mean we
oh yes ma'am well that was that was pretty good however the one in seventy nine and seventy eight and seventy nine dwarfed that one
yes ma'am since you know i have been well the firm i am with i've been with them for twenty three years so and they are in the north texas area
yeah i have seen quite a bit of weather patterns of course like i say when i was in the service i got to see plenty of
different locals as far as wet and dry climates and
i was kind of like you i'm i didn't want to go back to colorado because of the because of the tremendous weather we had
oh okay
tampa florida
uh-huh well let's see my in-laws winter in the leesburg area
well it's in the orlando area
and tampa saint petersburg is not that super far away
yeah something like that i think we made to from their house to bush gardens in ninety minutes that day
no not at that not down that tollway they've got
they're smokies you think our smokies are bad with our little mustangs that are hot rods they got them there too oh yeah
i know we were
puppies and he was flat moving
because i mean he didn't look happy when we went by
so i don't know maybe it was
who knows but anyway this weather here is certainly evolved from a from a dryer hotter nineteen eighty
to the last summer we had i think we barely what cleared a hundred
i think that was stretching it
oh well believe you me i'm not advocating cold summers no wrong but
the summer of nineteen eighty we saw one hundred fifteen and one hundred sixteen and i was running a little heating and air-conditioning business at the time
well
what happened there was that most of our everybody's customers down here about april start to call you know call their local guys
and we go out and tune up the systems
and we are normally expecting some a hundred degree days so we tune for that
so we had everybody nice in tune when the hundred and fifteen degree weather hit
and so the only thing that got replaced were the weak systems
you know that would barely make it at one hundred but when the hundred and fifteen degree days hit well it just couldn't handle the load and they then they then the compressors blew like popcorn
well
no i've only been here for the last ten years
i grew up most of my childhood in germany
and we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance
so we traveled all over europe
when i was when i was very young unfortunately a little bit too young to really appreciate
i was grade school age
that
that would be a to me a really nice vacation because i'm not in physical shape for something like that but
well my husband and i are scuba divers
so we both like to go to dive resorts we went to hawaii on our honeymoon
and we dove there
but we did about six dives while we were there and we were originally planning on going to cayman
last year
but we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip we had to have like eleven people for this package deal
and we couldn't get enough people together
to go so it ended up falling through we were going to get a really good price
uh-huh
uh-huh
snorkeling
oh really
well my husband and i both like water so any vacation that we go on is usually involves close to the ocean or something like that
yeah we
after we moved away from germany we moved to new hampshire
and i lived there for seven years
and i really enjoyed that because you know the mountains were real close we like the we like the white mountains and
unfortunately i didn't really get to go skiing much while i was there i went skiing once
uh-huh
not really so much if there was some place that we went to where there was hiking involved i would be
you know happy to go hiking but we never have really planned a vacation around places to go hiking
yeah our next vacation will be scuba diving i'm sure
no not yet
yeah
yeah it's a it's a little more difficult planning a vacation when you have children
yeah
yeah and diving is something that especially for small children i think the minimum age for diving is
is probably it legal anyway would be probably about sixteen
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
that sounds like a lot of fun our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that too there were
several hundred people and they all kind of met at a central place i didn't go
but it would have been nice it would have been a nice vacation
uh-huh
or something like what's the like the volkswagen vanagon i've heard is really nice
yeah
uh-huh
my dad has been talking for years about getting a fifth wheel
and just picking up he's retired he's in his sixties and he
would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there and just
you know not be settled anywhere just see the rest of the country
uh-huh
he does that quite a bit he hasn't lately though because he's been ill
uh-huh have you been a to a lot of the different historical sites
uh-huh
yeah i
i think right now while my husband and i don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can
doing things like scuba diving and adventurous types of things and then when we eventually when we have kids
i know his folks did a lot of traveling across country you know they went to the grand canyon and did things like that
yeah
yeah
yeah i do enjoy camping
yeah
it was nice talking to you too beth
okay bye-bye
oh uh-huh
well no they wouldn't would they no
well both of mine are boys they're eight and eleven
and we're into sports i mean as a matter of fact that's what we're doing tonight
baseball has started
oh yes we start here at five
up until it's coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in may so he's going to be with regular pitching and my eleven year old of course you know is pitching
uh-huh
but yes we're into baseball and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball we even have peewee basketball here so there's always something
both if we're not doing sports we go somewhere
oh yeah
no usually in the summer time
different places every year we
uh-huh
you know i've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often
and that must be the thing they really hadn't either they went to the memorial you know because when they go it's on business it's not really just to getting to sight see
oh i bet it is too
uh-huh
oh now my husband and i we go different places but our but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close
oh yes
oh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
yeah
yes
oh yes but we try you know i try my husband also we're involved in everything our kids does because
my dad died you know when i was less than a year old so i always just had a mother so i always thought when i have kids you know i really want to be involved with them
uh-huh
things yes that is yes
uh-huh
best friends now yes
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum yeah
oh uh-huh yeah
yes
uh-huh yeah
yeah you have to i mean you honestly do now i have friends that i love to death but and they have children but their children does anything we have to take them and
you know to do it and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying well i work full time too you know
yeah oh yeah
uh-huh
problem uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh yeah i agree with you very much so now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college and we knew
time wise or and money wise too would it would not have been a good idea to had them then
yes
uh-huh yeah
oh yes yeah
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh yeah if you if you can yeah
yeah
what are you wanting to be
what degree i mean what are you wanting to do after you get out of college
oh that's my husband's into computers
uh-huh
yeah
and you don't want to no
oh
uh-huh
hum
then you'll never leave yeah oh
oh uh-huh
well maybe something will open up for you
uh-huh
well i've enjoyed talking to you okay bye-bye
okay
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
oh no that throws the budget out of whack real fast
oh good
really that was smart
yeah
um-hum
oh uh-huh
yeah
wow that's great did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of
uh-huh gosh
yeah
yeah
yeah
then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house so we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well
and then moved from california where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved
so now since we have a three year old and a two year old now
that's that threw our budget really out of out of whack too
and we have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids and we just really have
and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all but it seems like there's
times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a babysitter and we'll go and we'll blow you know fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know
yeah that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or
splurge for you know birthday for somebody or you know even we even do things real frugally for the kids we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age you know whether they're jordache new or whether they're
you know something and they're both boys so they just fit one year after the other into each other's clothes so
but that's the hardest part for us is that it's really you know budgeting and some extra things you know for that are more you know nonessential items
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
you know a lot of things like that really are hard to plan for and
yeah kind of put in a certain amount per year you're going to have on extra expenses for car and
yeah
so that's not a good way of doing it
yeah
yeah
yeah because we don't miss it we really don't when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff so
but we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision the expenses for college already you know eighteen years away or whatever
gosh
i guess that's fantastic
oh
oh for goodness sakes what do you do
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
but i still take care of the yeah flower beds and things like that
i was even planning to go out and to dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but you know were planted in the ground since last spring
and i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me and lo and behold about
five days ago we had a freeze down to about
oh twenty three degrees or something
so the hibiscus plants no longer exist and i really feel bad about it it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty five years that these were cuttings off of you know
so
they're all gone at this point gardening in texas is really interesting though i grew up in illinois
a watering system
you know pretty nice all summer if you water but in the winter we have bermuda grass
and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
parents in illinois in the winter you know and their grass is
that stays green all winter
but they really have a heck of a time
they have to water an incredible amount
but those lawn those lawns look nice during the winter but you know they almost stick out like a
i guess not a sore thumb a pretty thumb but you know
right
um-hum
yes that's true yeah houston is a lot a lot wetter than dallas area that's where plano is
you know just all the time it's an awfully lot more humid
yes uh-huh i think people do yeah i don't have a vegetable garden haven't for
we have neil sperry talks on the
well yes i did i returned a number of things yesterday at jc penney
but it wasn't it was clothing
and
the blouse was supposed to be a size six but the shoulder drooped over my shoulder and it wasn't you know the style of the blouse it just
i think it was sized wrong but you know it was a nice blouse but and i took some lingerie back that wasn't
well i the size that i usually buy did not fit in their in their brand it was too small
but as far as large items go like appliances or things like that no
uh-huh
um-hum
well i would like to comment on my washer
my washer if it gets out of balance it makes a horrible noise
and you have to make sure that your clothes are balanced
but it was doing it quite frequently and so i had a repairman come out and look at it and he said well you need this and so done to this machine and i said oh really
and i he says let me show you and i said oh yeah i see that it really needs something bad you know but it didn't have an affect on the performance of the machine
what it was the it was a cap after your
after the body of the machine was in place it was under that so it wasn't visible
and it was out of sight
and it was rusting out
although i don't have any rust in my clothes and i said okay how much do you want to
do this repair work and he told me almost two hundred and fifty dollars and i said hey i can go buy a new one for that price
and i and i said no i'm not gonna do that i said the performance of the machine is not affected by that part
and i said and that's not that's not the cause of the imbalance i said i just have to be more careful how i put my clothes in
and so that was two years ago and my machine is still functioning fine
so i didn't you know and he wanted thirty five dollars for a service call and i says hey wait a minute they didn't tell me that when i called and i said i'm not paying it
i says if they had told me up front i would have paid it but since they did not say ma'am there's a thirty five dollar service call
but they didn't and i says i refuse to pay it and so he had called his office and told them what i said and i was released from that service charge
so you know they were they to me that was underhanded i wouldn't have minded if they had said okay we have that service is thirty five dollars or whatever they charge maybe it's different
charges for different things i don't know but it seems to me a service call would be kind of universal for anything
and then they get into the nitty gritties of charges for whatever you've got wrong with your
you write them
yeah they really could
yes
oh they're a fantastic company to deal with
oh uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
oh my
well i'm more interested in the long-term effects than the short-term effects in terms of balancing budget and so forth
i tend to view and i take a fairly radical view towards economic policy and feel that
well it has to be done somewhat arbitrarily at on in some instances i think that goods should cost real total costs rather than just manufacturing costs
and that means if you oh produce something that creates adverse health effects that should somehow be reflected in the product if you the cost of
forestry that you cut down and such needs to be reflected
in
well i think i think my long-term sense of budget concerns is that we're going is
a lot of others government's spending goes on goes towards this health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are
brought about by various factors such as such as pollution stress you know work environment conditions and so forth but generally the government is
government or individuals end up paying for that rather than the some of the source of need for the health care
but that's a very long-term sort of concern
i don't i don't have great short-term effects other than reducing spending and raising taxes and no one likes the idea of raising taxes very much and
no one likes the idea of reducing spending very much so i don't see any real immediate hope i mean it's the whole quota's living on debt i mean but and they buy things on credits constantly
um-hum
yeah well exactly
um-hum
yeah well i'm in academics and actually i'm in the job market now trying to get a professorship and i'm watching the education budget getting cut
back so severely at least in california where i am where there's a very severe budget crisis because of agriculture was wiped out last year and a number of other things and
because i'm i have a lot of i have some personal investments in this in addition to whatever philosophical investment
there is and i don't know it's amazing that in the last ten years we've gone from a major loaning nation to a major debt nation
and
um-hum yeah well i can see you know it's
it's kind of funny because we it seems like we loan money you know we money with strings attached and if the government changes and the country that we loan the money to
and it's the governments it's the governments that that's really what we do you don't go up to the country you talk to the president or the chair or whatever of some group and you loan it to these people who are representing the government
and by extension representing the country but when those people are gone and you have some new
you know starving third world country with a brand new government that threw the previous rascals out
i don't know there's if there's a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i tend to get a little upset about loans to obviously corrupt governments
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
you could afford to pay more taxes
um-hum
um-hum well boy i mean i completely agree with you on
the stress that the tax burden for the upper class has actually decreased over the last ten years
yeah it's
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah they
they get things that they pay for
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i think that's well i think that's an important thing personally
um-hum
well they
yeah i think the americans that i know who are sort of antitax a lot of them seem antitax because they're distrustful of the government will spend their money wisely
and the sense is i can spend the money on myself if i gave it to the government they would just waste it
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
which is a propaganda phrase used a lot against exactly such types of spending programs and
you usually say creeping socialism to conjure up fears of bread lines in moscow but if you use i mean this creeping
i'm starting to split stuff off the only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb they make me drive it like a mile down the road and split it out down there what are they doing up there
but the deposits only on like drink stuff
okay
okay
oh okay
so is they you're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting the money
or you got or they somehow distributing the funds back to you
oh okay
that's very cool you know there's a i heard about a similar program in new york city where i think it's called like homeless incorporated or something like that but what they do is employ homeless i think mostly men but homeless people
to go out and collect all the recyclable cans and i think it's mostly cans there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they bring them up to a one
one centralized location and are able to collect the money from the various beer and soda manufacturers and get more money to these people that desperately need it
do they do it with newspapers as well
hm
i'm barbara
well it's nice to meet you where are you from
oh i'm in garland
uh-huh
yes i am
i wear dresses skirts
that type of attire i'm a secretary
uh-huh
you don't
oh so you can dress carefree right
what is your best mode of clothing
what is your best mode of clothing you like blue jeans best
yes that's what i wear mainly is suits cotton or gabardine
yes
no i don't do it every day
just occasionally do you have a certain fabric you like better than others
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i like cotton the best it's easier to take care of and it's a much fresher and freer fabric
well cotton you have to iron unfortunately or send to the cleaners but there's some fabrics like you said that gabardines and suedes and that have to go to the cleaners all the time
yes
yes i'm up in corporate
yes
yes because the first person they see is the secretary before the boss and i couldn't get away with blue jeans and a t-shirt
do you wear sneakers do you wear
brand names or do you just get something off the shelf at the stores
um-hum
i see do you like sweaters
do you wear them often
um-hum
oh are you
that was my next question is to how you where you used to live and how you dressed in comparison to where you were before
uh-huh
um-hum
are you into hats
do you wear hats and for dress up too or just
in winter
um-hum
hum in your new career after college you going to need clothes a lot
uh-huh
um-hum
do you like clothes for different seasons or do you like just to wear the basically the same type of thing and just add or take away from it
so i'm sorry
what kind of benefit benefits do you have at work
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
oh yeah is there a something that you wished you had that you don't or
yeah
um-hum
yeah i work for a relatively small company we're a trade association for credit unions and
our benefits are fairly good and like you say that support i mean you work directly with the president and the executive vice president and you know they you get the feedback from them directly and i like that but
i wish i really the thing i like i guess i wouldn't mind having a better retirement plan we have just a defined benefit plan and
i kind of would like the idea of having a 401k or something that i could you know contribute to and get some matching contributions
that'd be a lot that's one thing i wish i had a little bit more of but
yeah
i don't know i'm kind of the type i just don't wanna work my whole life i'd rather be able to
make my money and be able to retire and enjoy a lot of things before
and so that's and that's one way i can see doing it but none of them
uh-huh
uh-huh
works good
yeah that's like i say ours
we're we get vacation is pretty good too i mean it's you get a week after the first year two after the second three after the third and it goes up
just every year by a week up until i think like six years which is a lot better than anybody else i'd ever heard of
yeah that's quite a bit of vacation to have after six years service so
it it's a credit union league they're kind of a trade association for credit unions we
kind of do a lot of the
political support and stuff like that
for the different credit unions within the state
but
oh did she
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
huh what did she work for
uh-huh
oh really
yeah that sounds pretty familiar to me
but
um-hum
yeah
i don't know have you heard of any people that kind of do this the cafeteria plan where they kind of let you choose what kind of benefits you get or
is that something that florida does or where your work the state of florida or you pretty much get what they give you and
yeah i guess a lot of the more some of the newer companies and the up and coming real fast growing ones kind of do that way but some people say it ends up costing them more because whatever
you know men and women alike they give them say three hundred bucks a month and they can buy their health insurance and their retirement and whatever but
and if whatever they don't use they get in cash
but a lot of companies don't like to do that because they figure if you got two people working then one spouse might take insurance and the other won't so it saves the company money
whereas this one you know you'd end up paying regardless
but for the employees it sure sounded like a pretty good idea
but anyway i haven't
haven't got so fortunate as to get into any of those companies yet
but
anyway
well hey it was good talking to you
all right see you later bye-bye
yeah
the weather is this time of year has actually been kind of unusual i've expected it to be colder until you know what we've gotten last couple days
i don't know i fly for a living and i've the weather's been terribly unusual every where i've been
yeah
yeah
no kidding
hm
saturday or sunday they were saying yeah
yeah i know the systems have been real strong out i went through phoenix on twice on wednesday morning
and shot approaches to low minimum it was both times you know and phoenix never gets that kind of weather
yes i am with southwest yeah yep
yeah
oh is that right
well now i no i wouldn't call it danger this is this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in this is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the springtime
you know the air systems are reasonably calm you don't have the turbulence you know you little bit of chop but it's not like it is in the spring time
so
spectacular is the right word for them
spectacular is a good word for them
it's amazing
oh yeah
yeah cloud to cloud it can be real really sensational here
yeah really where you from originally
um-hum
oh
oh yeah
oh yeah
were you near they were near the park cities area
yeah that's beautiful area
um-hum
well we've skied i have not skied that area i've driven through it several times i've we skied california a bunch when we lived out there and
and of course grew we grew up in minnesota and we do some skiing there
lot of cross country skiing there
well not really i you know minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow the
we've getting a fair amount of rain for this time of year already i think and i've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today you know that moved in last night
yeah
yes it did
yeah
yeah it was it was real cold that was very unseasonable for us down here
yeah
oh yeah that's real true same with us from minnesota it's in fact i've i played golf on the on the new year's day one year
you know it was yeah
no
oh it is it is
well and they've had you know usually in minnesota they get their snow in january and february
and they're up over sixty five or sixty
so
tough question i mean it it's
i was actually kind of thinking about it the other day someone was talking about it how a person who takes someone else's life he was saying should not deserve the right to keep their own life
it's kind of it's a really you know it's a moral dilemma i don't know
i think that i forget what the law is in my state i mean my home state i'm from i'm from maryland
and i just
yeah i mean it kind of seems going back to eye for an eye hand for a hand kind of thing
maybe
i don't know it's like
you kind of wonder do you want someone like jeffrey dahmer alive or not
oh or charles manson
yeah
like i don't see charles manson i think he'll never get out he's
he's probably going to be up for parole in a year or so but he's not going to it's not going to happen
this could be
yeah i think even if they aren't in the media i don't know if it would happen unless maybe it was
bureaucracy that got pushed aside
and someone said ah we'll let them out
i don't know someone i don't know i mean i guess there's are probably are small time serial killers that you don't hear about
something
i don't know because i think i don't think they actually execute prisoners too often because there's i mean there's death row
there's a lot of time where prisoners are kept on death row for a long time i mean yeah there was ted bundy
there was i mean there was such an outcry to execute him because it i mean he was the crimes he did were just so heinous
now i think that there's it's just such a controversial thing that it doesn't happen too often i'm not so i at least at least i don't hear about it that often
nah i don't think there's been an execution in my state in a long time that i know of
and i know that like
one of the one of the things that that's one of the things that the that amnesty international is against in the united states is capital punishment yeah
of any of any kind so that's the one thing they have against the united states one of their gripes
i don't know there might be some that don't
yeah
tough to
to what's i'm looking for to justify
i guess
i kind of waver i guess sometimes
it's
someone like jeffrey dahmer you kind of
so eating out
what are you interested in restaurants
oh
once a week twice a week
yeah i understand
but we both work and we have a daughter and
we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway
really i'm kind of open on food i'm
what you might call a culinary adventurer i'll
i'll try anything once
been on a real barbecue kick lately
yeah
excuse me
yeah
we usually have chinese once a month
i hate franchised restaurants
i despise franchised restaurants i
always prefer to go to
something that seems more family run
some place where you
seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost
i don't
but i don't like something fake or put on either
you know if i could have the good small restaurant or a good large restaurant i'd go to the good small restaurant
and
i think it's probably due to
pricing often
well yeah
yeah
it is what you usually look oh isn't
i try to
get my money's worth
and
not just that i try to
well that's a big part of it i try to get my money's worth
you know
and not just in quantity you know but quality and
flavor and texture and care
well presentation's not always all of it either it's important
but
um-hum
yeah something a little extra
and just for color if nothing else
yeah
yeah
what i miss up here is
i'm originally a texan
and i'm
miss
home cooked mexican yeah home cooked tex-mex mexican restaurants where
it's not owned by an anglo or a corporation
and
yeah
well there's real mexican food and there's real tex-mex mexican you know by
third or fourth generation americans
of the hispanic heritage
of course when you talk about mexican cuisine you that's kind of like talking about american food or a chinese food because
its regional too
you know
and
yeah here a couple years ago my wife and i went to seattle on vacation
and i think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week and it was
i was like a man starving at every meal
ha
it's a lot cheaper there isn't it lobster
it's like shrimp on the gulf
two ninety eight a pound
that's as cheap as steaks some places
i mean in a grocery store yeah
it sounds wonderful so
that sound good i
down in the gulf i've eaten a bunch of those little
oh seafood shacks we've called them
and
it's just it so much different than to eat something that's been frozen
you know
shrimp straight out of the bay
hm
was it true
ah yes the cajuns
they can they can do things to shrimp that no one else can so have you eaten crawfish yet
oh as with anything it's preparation
uh-huh
it there's all kinds
so you do eat out a lot
one of our other
real problems with going out to eat sunday morning brunches
you know sunday brunch all you can eat brunches
we still find it fun
but
well am
i work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor
and so
yeah actually one of our
one of our favorites is a chain
shoney's
and in spite of the
we do like shoney's pretty well but then there's a
place up the pass up in the mountains
that we pretty reliably like to go to on some sunday mornings
drive up to i think it's about
eight thousand foot elevation and
and
and drive through woodland park and
go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast and
it
it's the way to spend a nice sunday morning
the colorado springs what
west out of
okay does is this something that concerns you
uh-huh
yeah well i live outside of dallas and it's kind of in a little suburb so i feel pretty safe out here but i know the murder rate is going up every year
in dallas and that worries me
yeah
yeah there's a little boy that just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects which is
you know sort of a bad area but he was just out riding his big wheel and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet
that's really sad i've so you know it must be
frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that
be so scary
it really doesn't it's kind of scary i think that
i think the laws have gotten so lenient you know the court systems are too lenient
i think that's part of the problem
yeah i think so i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe they'd think twice about doing it
yeah the other thing that worries me about it is kids that are doing such bad crimes so young you know like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill
people they i don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything but that worries me i wonder what the next generation will be like
yeah
yeah
oh
yeah
seems like if they had more immediate consequences to their actions it would sink in faster
yeah because it seems like now even in the country you hear about
bad things happening so
yeah i think they have them in dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools
yeah seemed like in the fifties when gangs were big it was just to be part of the gang but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that
it seems scarier
really yeah those machine guns and all that yeah that's scary it's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore
yeah dallas they were saying in dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that you know eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because
they won't let them hire any new ones and they keep leaving
huh yeah they figure what a heyday huh
well thanks same for you bye
huh-uh
well there not i mean there really is no soviet union now unfortunately they still do have a lot of nuclear weapons
and the one thing that worries me is question of stability and control
and i think it's too early to say you know whether they're going to develop some stable societies there in one form or another
turn their fate over to some insane ruler is going to surface again
no they really didn't now you know they never really have had democracy there in any sense so
it's going to take both democracy and economic progress and resolution of their nationalist institutes i guess
all of that is going to have to happen and if any one of them turn sour they could still be dangerous simply because they might not
you know they just might sort of lose track of what they're doing
but that's really part of the danger because they still have you know i think there still missile bases or silos in
in kazakhstan probably in ukraine
as well as in russia those in russia may be some of them in areas that may have
strong local national sentiments because they aren't all russians you know they're a lot of enclaves they have other nationalities
and if even one
missile silo got in the hands of someone who is determined to
cause trouble for some for some reason they might launch a missile on someone
governments and militaries and it's not always clear which one of them is in charge
well that's maybe the extreme pessimistic view
think if yeltsin has a chance and if they can follow his lead in the other republics or whatever they want to call themselves now
they'll probably come out of it okay
what in the former soviet union
not much i don't think i think that
probably or image there is pretty good most places as i understand it
what might make them angry at us may make the people angry at us or the governments or both or
well
i think if they
thought that we were taking advantage of their current preoccupations with internal matters or with
well i don't do anything with the lawn really but i do gardening both flowers and vegetable gardening
i we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden and that's fun well actually we've always had one even when we haven't had big yard because we enjoy that we love fresh vegetables in the summer and
it's just one of the things i enjoy doing
yes i do so i manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward i work for a school system so i'm able to do that because i get home a little earlier
and i can still do some sorts of things but
wow
oh that's wonderful
but that's i mean you really feel you can accomplish something and to help other people too that's neat
uh-huh
right
that's wonderful yeah
yeah well i think it sounds good i've never belonged to a garden club because i've always been more interested in just doing what i can do on my own i've never had the time really to get involved in the organized
sort of format but i know people who do it and enjoy it very much
oh
my word
for heaven's sake
well there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that i know of they're women but and usually they're the tea type things you know where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing but flowers are primarily the emphasis
whereas i enjoy vegetable gardening almost more i do flowers sort of look pretty but i
i really like to do the vegetables
being what
oh my well what a wonderful thing
yes
oh terrible yeah
okay well the flowers i'm just in fact i was going to go out today to buy some plants so i could put them in i always have geraniums and
and then i have a shady area that i need to be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun so i've discovered that impatiens that tried and true is turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus
and they're better for the sun areas and of course you know the mine are old very ordinary flowers marigolds and that sort of thing
in my
no i don't i don't know maybe this climate is a little better
but in the vegetable garden we grow
usually well our favorite is something called white half runner green beans now that's
well you know why because i grew up in north carolina and that was my mother's favorite bean she always grows you know five different varieties but that's the kind that produces the best
and they're good both ways
yeah
oh in between the size wise yeah
oh of
yeah it is they're two different vegetables that way um-hum
oh my gosh
but she doesn't have that big a garden but she has a bigger one than i do and i have four children you know so
oh yes oh yes oh it is it's great it's really her joy and i suppose that's why i enjoy gardening because you know growing up with it we also grow yellow and green squash much to my children's chagrin
and we grow a lot of tomatoes there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes
so we enjoy that we grow i have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family but i actually was successful for the last two years so
i'm going to do it again that's right and we grow broccoli
and i have been
very happy about the new way of controlling the worm that gets in broccoli
by using the bacillus thuringiansis which is the little well in fact that's what they use for gypsy moth i don't know if you have had that problem there or not
but it's you know it's a problem that's moving south from the new england area and they devastate the trees so they spray the government sprays
two three times in the spring when the caterpillars are coming along because what they do this bacillus the worms ingest it and it expands in their in their
digestive tract and they die
so that's the same technique that you know for any of the other little varmints that get in vegetables so it that's really very nice because it's a non-toxic way of handling the problem
so
oh so well that's not very long
yes
oh that's great that's great well i hope you have a an opportunity to garden again
oh well good
bye-bye
especially the last few years
it's kind of has it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it
that's what i was thinking
usually the bitterest weather if we're gonna have any comes in january and february then by march things are getting warm again so we really don't have as long a cold season i guess as people up north
no it's nice i just came in from outside and it's really pretty it's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out
-fore it rains again i'm a i'm a scoutmaster and so i wind up going out camping with
a bunch boys at one time and so its better for us if it hasn't been just totally wet before we go
oh yeah
yeah we camp year round
but it's definitely different and then i guess you've been through a couple of summers here too right
well it is
it's not as humid as houston say or atlanta but it
its more humid than arizona and california for the most part
were you northern california
central okay so that was
dry but pretty even climate wasn't it year round fairly not wide fluctuations
but it's a drier
oh
what types of what take what type of business takes you to those climates or was that just vacation or something
oh
not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages
oh
that's interesting you don't think about that as a career a normal career when you're thinking of things that people might be doing
well the
i think all in all there are a lot worse climates than dallas the weather
you know does change fast and things do happen severely a few times a year but there's an awful lot of good weather too in between
yeah and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time i like that
think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east texas and it is a little more humid out there than it is here so
i guess we'll
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the
systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms and it
it doen't seem to be
we have a terrible air pollution problem
our summers are extremely hazardous and during ah certain
wind directions because we get the gary indiana chicago pollution
and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze coming up along the lake
and they do post warnings for people who have heart diseases or respiratory problems
during that summer season in the winter it's not as severe
but if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
the state of wisconsin as a matter of fact started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution we were getting
ah i don't think it's gonna go very far but it was a way of ah triggering awareness
so what's the conditions like in dallas
and they're tested for their pollution control equipment
and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it's it is drivable
madison has one of the nicest bike road sharing programs of any city in wisconsin
in all of wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
and there is a real promotion of biking
but there are still a lot of people who'll insist on driving their own automobiles to go everywhere
i find that a little irritating because i don't think it's always so necessary
the acid rain and they'll they may wake up you know how would you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of the acid rain
it's a really a serious issue for those of us up in this ah sector up here
and i don't know exactly where it emerges from when it it's up in the ah northern sectors of wisconsin that causes the acid rain
that i'm a little uncertain of but i do know that it is a problem
oh really what kinds of things have you done
do you ever keep any of your stuff
oh well can you go to so and so's house
yes
ooh
that would be definitely something you'd want to keep was the whole face done or just the numbers and like minute
marks
oh
i did some needlepoint years ago and then i got into the bargello
well it's an italian
needlework using the i started to say the canvas but the
hum the
what kind of cloth uses that i i've just gone blank but it's used with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth
and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or
whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to
to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel embroidery work that was done on them
i can't find one that i've done it it's one of those things i didn't i didn't give them away but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves
or what and it i was so proud of them when i got them finished
but i have no idea where they are
bargello it's b a r g e double l o
i suspect you i suspect you have
how did you know to choose this subject tonight that's funny
what how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the how were you decorating the baskets
like fabric that's been stiffened in yes
i've seen some and there they i suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady i've seen i know that does it i've never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six
and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly
when i do crochet it's usually the lacy victorian type
things like that and i stiffen those with a glue mixture it's like white glue
and it may be something similar to that the fabric is dipped in and then
allowed to dry in those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i don't know i was just there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with
high humidity
in a room
quilted hanging it's like it's a flag and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust collector to be
oh you don't have time
you definitely don't have time
that
i have a similar problem i've got to have time or i don't even want to get into it in the first place
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all
what was this project
now this is this is done in the needlepoint hm
yes i do know i have done a little bit of that but i've decided that that's something that demands my time my total attention
and so i've got to have
total almost total silence i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish
oh
i'm sure you'll get it done but it just maybe not on the original obviously not on the original time schedule
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that
do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a kit like for a bib or something like that
okay
that's what i would do too
or whatever i have that's
ooh
what
with ink or oh okay
oh that sounds really neat did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink okay so you just
just like being finger printed
okay where are you calling from
i'm in california
right it's just about twelve thirty here
absolutely
well so is ours we have just been told that we're thirteen billion dollars in the red which is more than the entire state budgets of about half a dozen states
and they're talking about cutting aid to the schools particularly the university systems
and i our local school district is going to have to fire all it's teacher aides to balance the budget so i things are tough all over
oh prop thirteen is the one that
limits the amount that real estate taxes can rise every year property taxes can only go up a certain
uh-huh
uh-huh
i don't know what we're going to do long range to solve the budgeting problem but there certainly has been proposals why are you aware of the grace commission proposals from a few years back
well the wr grace was put in charge of a commission to find government waste i guess this is about eight or ten years ago now and he came out with a whole book
of his group i mean it has his name but he was just the administrator of it of places where things like government purchasing could be rationalized where
renting of space could be made much more efficient where a lot of the accounting is just you know incredibly byzantine and could be straightened out and where lots of different government activities are redundant
and where and there are billions of dollars in every years budget that are just totally wasted because nobody is running the government as if it were a business
and
we couldn't afford to do that sort of thing we can't we don't have money to throw around personally
uh-hum
it has no incentive to hold back on expenses i happened many years ago to work for a state government for a while and
it absolutely boggled my mind the way they budgeted because there was no an attempt to figure out what it really should cost to do what we should be doing
it was just take last year's budget add x percentage ask for that and if you hadn't spent all your money by december run out and buy something quick so that you
that's right i can remember the entire office got new electric typewriters because we hadn't spent all our budget money in december that was just crazy
that's right
we might come up short next year if we haven't spent everything this year and so no matter how foolish the expenditure be sure we get rid of that money
absolutely
i think probably if you just looked at congressional budgets the amount they waste on frivolous things with congressional office staff is
again mind boggling you read about what it costs the new house whip or the speaker of the house to redecorate and my god those offices were just redecorated a few years ago
they it they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars they're spending twenty five thousand dollars just this year
for a feasibility study to determine whether they should build a second gym at the capitol for the staffs of the congress
well it that's the kind of thing that makes me mad i want to vote the whole batch of them out of office if that's the way they think they should spend our money and just because it's a few hundred thousand here
who was it said a billion here a billion there pretty soon we're talking about real money
yes it is
and when we're talking about adding that much to a budget where it's just already in the hole just the think about the amount of interest we'll be paying on that we'll probably more than double it
that's right
yeah the only difference is the taxpayers that's right
uh-huh or our children and grandchildren
i hope it will
i'm
well the thing is
yes i'm an editor at a think tank
well it's a fascinating job i get to see all kinds of interesting ideas
and i do my small bit to help in at least express themselves coherently even if i don't always agree with what they're expressing
well we've got some really interesting people we get fifty different fellows every year from all around the world
and so we get just the year of intense interaction with these people and sometimes we really hate to see them go we'd like to keep them for years and years and lots of times we're not so
i was a
resident although very young of the of what is now the state of alaska in nineteen fifty nine when alaska stopped being a territory became a state
so i guess i have a left over
positive feeling about the question even though i don't know very much about puerto rico
i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive and i have a suspicion that i
believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or let it go one or the other
what is your situation
oh that's very interesting
your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on puerto rico or pressures on the us in terms of aid or
um-hum
um-hum
i guess
we're assuming that puerto rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than say mississippi or
okay
that's something that i guess i have not much of an image of other than
than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a
pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and also difficulties they have
i don't know whether state statehood would improve their economy i don't i don't know that the act of being a state
would have any impact on them i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax
i don't know if they suffer
in a sense of
income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be
how do you feel though about
well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory but i wonder how having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in the in the
alaska at the time since they voted absentee
i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry
to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote the district of columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times
in their not having a senate representative
um-hum
i see what you mean so that
yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring there i don't know i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation
frequently the laws in a territory are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i and i'm thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico
it's interesting because i hadn't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to economy
i had thought of it more in terms of political
realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the us than an independent country
so
um-hum
uh-huh
that's interesting
well it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo
and i think having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so i'm i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also
at this point
leaning towards statehood
i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if louisiana chose to go with creole or something
i don't think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of america's strengths and that's the melting pot i
am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to the past and i'm also realizing that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
and canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to french quebec and whatever that i think that would be
a negative step to make and i think that they would need to reassess that
i'm troubled even in by bilingualism in so far as that it gets in the way of the melting pot aspect
hum
yeah
but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language
i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called
good-bye
i'm a more of a wanna be
my wife
was an only child but her family all through her adolescence had a small pull behind trailer
so they didn't go out necessarily camping in tents and such but they did a lot of weekend trips all through the midwest and the east lancaster pennsylvania and so forth and so on they did a lot of traveling with that so
if you count that as camping which may some people may or may not she had a lot of experience with that and
when we first got engaged and got married we you know kind of hung around did a lot of stuff with her folks till they sold the trailer and then finally they passed away but
um-hum
yeah i know what you mean
sure
there you go
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's more like a mobile home
not a camper
uh-huh
yeah
i guess my kid you know my kids go to the ym or go to the girl scout camp
there are several of them here in southwest ohio that are all run by the same council
and they're usually there for a week each during the summer at some point so they're they do a lot more rustic camping but most of their meals are served in the mess hall
i think they have one or two outings where they cook at the campsite
out in the fringes of the of the park rather than at the than at the mess hall so they get some of it
the only other opportunity really that i get anything like that is in the summer
i'm a ham radio operator and
oh can't wait like a pilgrimage to mecca
but and it's very convenient for me because it's only forty five minutes up the road
but for field day which is an exercise in the summer where ham it know it's a couple of things it's supposed to be a demonstration of how
the ham community can be mobilized to operate under simulated emergency or field conditions
yeah where well some people set up towers other people use a fishing line and pull wires up into trees and use wire antennas or whatever -pending on how energetic the club is but
you know it it's also a contest see how many other ham stations you can contact who are doing the same thing
and then it's also a chance to get out with your buddies and drink beer and play radio all night
or if you know we have a number of women in the club also but you know it's a chance to get out with your friends and drink beer and play radio all night
but we do go out to one of the local city municipal whatever parks here in cincinnati and you know go up on top of a tall hill and string some wires up in the trees and such and
put out the picnic tables and lawn chairs and set up the equipment with a generator and set up a tent for the kids to sleep in or for the people who are who are taking a break to go off and sleep in
and then use propane
stove to cook breakfast at six o'clock the next morning with and that's about as close to camping as i really have much of a chance to get right now
um-hum
oh um-hum
i read about just anything that i can get my hands on
exactly
yeah i pretty much carry my own reading material too i mean i'll be walking to i mean walking to the elevator to work and i'll be reading a book on the way up in the elevator and everybody laughs at me
um-hum
hm
uh-huh is it a is it a satire or
uh-huh
well i like i said i gosh i can't remember the last book i bought but i've read so many and any book my mother usually has a stack at her house so i'll go and pick up one over there and
or several actually and just get through them one by one mostly i like i don't know
i suppose
mystery or history true history
that type of thing
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
no i can't say that i've been to the library lately i've found quite a bit i mean i'm either reading a newspaper or a magazine or like i said anything i can get my hands on
exactly
uh-hum
yeah
i well i end up just picking out key sections and reading those and the rest of it if i get to it fine if not
um-hum
yeah well i know my dad gets i mean he gets the two dallas papers here and he sits down for at least about
but eventually
exactly
exactly
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
it's really a much better idea it's a bit inconvenient for me but i've always told myself i'd do that because
i don't know i get the books and then after i read them if i really like them i'll keep them but if not you know it's wasted space for me so i end up giving them away
well that's good
hm
um-hum
well i'll read the reviews
and if they end
hello my name is nola i'm in plano texas
not too far away
i've had some from plano too
uh-huh
okay let's see
social changes
sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties i guess
think we can handle that
okay shall i go ahead and push one
okay
you want to go ahead and start
that involves a lot of different areas i think
yeah there is a big difference in the economic
status of people although i think that has been true always
perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was
i think
in my situation i have three children and we're home schooling so education you know things that relate to education
are things that i think about a lot i think that and i think that involves
social changes a lot
for instance
i think the schools are having more and more problems because of things that
are happening socially in the world around them and in because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather
more not than are and children being put in day care centers from very early and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the
day care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes
because of the way children are being raised they're not learning the values they need to learn and they're not
deal with the things in the world
and i think we're seeing a lot of
rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang
gang things that are happening and
yeah
yeah oh
that's really sad i think that a lot of people and they think they have to but i think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to and i think that if they didn't that
and it became more of the standard not to
that i don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home you know and have a more solid foundation for the kids
yeah
that's right
it's already
it already costs society much more because of it you know it trying to do all these programs like headstart and things like those you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know
there's and i think a lot of it is selfishness people have become very selfish they don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that there are a lot of two parent
situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do you know
rather than that she has to have the money particularly or maybe there's a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too
you know
home school
yeah
no we're i have one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and one on the way
yes and i think it's becoming more popular then it has been for a while i think
home schooling's always been around but i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools and a lot of it is discipline problems
a lot of it is and you can tell which kids have been in day care centers it it's really obvious
to look at them and watch the way they act and things that
they've been raised in a day care center
well i think it's going to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base
it's the basic unit
and that's the where it all starts and if we don't start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better
and educating you know
i know they do some they do have some classes in high schools and things for kids to give them an idea of what
family life is like and the you know
and that kind of thing but
hello fine
okay let me ask you something can i run a minute and shut my radio off okay
okay
arlington texas yes
yes not all good stuff
no i'm not personally
uh-huh
yes right
yes
yes i've been in my own business mary kay in fact i'm selling it out now to go to school for a turn and i enjoyed the freedom of having
that you know go to work when i wanted to and not but you know the benefits weren't there so
oh do you yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right
yep um-hum
i think today the thing that i
would appreciate the most because my husband gets his medical through his company but we have to pay for mine
and we're the only one that i'm the only one that's being insured
and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children have i mean so it's kind of and i would i really and the way medical expenses are
i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to you need to have
right
it's out of sight right it's out of sight
even at a group rate i couldn't believe how much is our
right it goes up right
um-hum
right
right
right it's going to hurt the city although i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank and i would see the gm people come in when they were they would shut down to retool
they were paid that whole time and i don't know if you're aware of this yes
they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and
in a way because of the unions being so strong
and right now anybody that's laid off from gm will have a full year's paycheck
i just read this in the paper the other day plus probably an additional six months through the worker's stuff that they have at
at through the company so i'm you know i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt but i don't feel as sorry for them if my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check and that would be it
yes oh yeah that's already hurting yeah
but i think there's a case where benefits have gotten they voted them in and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know
and it made the prices of cars go up and
and you know the i we i believe in unions but they went too far
i mean i can't make eighteen dollars an hour
i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour
i think that's their main problem they seem to have stuck with the same core of players robin yount paul molitor and jim gantner
who they're real good players but they seem to just depend on them to produce a pennant and it isn't working
except for papa ryan anyway
yeah
that's right he can't win them all for him
yeah i think the thing about the brewers is too their pitching they never have really had real good pitching
last time they had really good pitching was back in the early eighties when they got to the world series was with people like vuckovich and fingers
yeah and of course
he got them to the series but then just before the series that year in eighty two he
threw his elbow out or something shoulder or elbow i can't remember which and
they're number two right-hander in the bullpen pete ladd who was kind of a rookie that year had to take his place and i think that's why they lost the series because in game two in saint louis
they had a pretty good lead going into late innings and ladd got rattled when he didn't get some calls and they ended up losing the game ole mustache fingers would not have done that
i can't remember if he's made it or not yet he may not have been i don't know when he retired actually
yeah but that was i think eighty two was
well eighty one was the year i think that he won the
cy young and the mvp and the fireman of the year award all at the same time i think but in eighty two i think he won something some kind of award had a lot of saves anyway
well i'd forgotten that gossage was with the rangers the he was this year last year
now did they pick him up sometime in the middle of the season or what
yeah
yeah well he's been quite a reliever in his time
yeah
well we'll be looking for them to improve in that area i guess because at least the
now that i think about them a little bit i'm getting sort of back through the football season back into baseball i realize when you think of the rangers now you got a real good looking young outfield there for the most part and
quite a few of the infielders are
probably have real good careers still ahead of them i'm not sure why they got rid of buechele but i guess it worked out for him okay
yeah
oh inky went the wrong way though didn't he
now who did they trade him to i cleveland
detroit
oh
oh they released him really didn't they
yeah
my goodness when he was when he was when he could really get into a ball though he was had a lot of power i tell you he reminds me a lot of gorman thomas remember him
center fielder for the brewers there for a while there was a guy that
well i don't think his fielding was generally that bad he as a matter of fact he was
yeah right
yeah he did get better and i think he was one of george bamburger's big projects when he took over at the at milwaukee
he was the guy that was up and down
well i've kind of resisted having any pets because well i had some pets as a child
but you know now that i have two kids they're sort of like pets
you have to take care of them a lot and they require a lot of time and neatness and plus you know now that i'm married i have
a husband that i do some things that you know help him
and so it seems like i have plenty things to do and so i thought that if we got a pet that would just be one more person
well the kids you know the kids wanted
the kids love all kinds of pets you know cats and dogs and things and i know some kinds of pets are more
independent and as a child i had you know like a we had a dog and we had turtles and
we had
a little baby chicken and all that but they say you shouldn't do that any more but
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
yes
they can take care of themselves especially cats are pretty good about being independent
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
well we just last week we got a gerbil that's a thing that i picked for the kids because they were wanting to have a pet and i didn't want to have one i picked gerbils because
they apparently they aren't like you know they don't smell as bad as other
yeah oh that's awful and i don't like that odor and
and they don't require as much but we'll see how it works out it wasn't as
it's not something that i had to like learn to
something that's going to be running around your house that if you're unaccustomed to that you wouldn't like such a big change and
well we're just getting used to them right now we're kind of just letting you know touching them
and we've picked them up before but that was kind of scaring them pretty bad right now
well they
seem like you know they were smaller compared to some of the other ones
but we
we i did that i
let the kids have a pet because
i wanted them to have practice in caring for someone else and you know not being so selfish
they're four and five
and i thought it would be good for them to just practice you know having someone else to care for and
everything i know that a lot of pets a lot of people have pets
because they make good companions and
friends and
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
expensive to maintain and
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's true they are a lot i guess that's the number one reason why i'm
yeah they are not
because they don't really acknowledge that they know you know it's not like a pet a pet is someone that comes up to you and is happy to see you and that kind of thing
but
uh-huh
that's true
a long time
yes and they take up a lot of you know good space like kind of like a bookcase
uh-huh huh
no
yes and i noticed that's kind of what i was attracted to these gerbils for is that they have a certain area that they use like their bathroom
and you can just you know rinse that out it's kind off to the side it unscrews and
and so you can just take it out with a garden hose rinse it out
uh-huh
oh no
well i'm hoping that it'll be a little bit of diversion for the kids and a little bit of a
they do and they're anxious for us to be able to hold it but i
these just aren't going to be as tame as the book i got a book first
two
well we hope that we got two females so that they're supposed to get along better
and they won't have any babies
well but you know the people that sold them go well it's hard to tell but we think and we're going oh great
so if they have babies then we'll have to get rid of one of them
yeah that's what i hear so i'm hoping i think they have a really quick reproduction cycle of only like thirty days or something
so within a month i guess or two we'll know
well i guess i better run go
yes nice
well thanks and it was nice to hear that you've had such good luck with your cat
well i say the
probably the best thing to do is
yeah so
how do you how do you feel that's of course being facetious but
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum and i guess also what the system will absorb
they're probably more tuned in to that possibly though on
capital cases like maybe the death penalty
i'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole
i mean he could have like a personal prejudice you know judges are people
like everybody else even though they're supposed to be impartial but
maybe
i think that's think that's the way it is whether they decide whether or not they
accused or whatever would get the get the death penalty
do they have a death penalty in california
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i something like that i've got no problem with them
i guess the way i think about it is
yeah exactly
i guess
kind of the way i think about it also is they just
if somebody gets the death penalty they're judged guilty they got the death penalty
they should have one year and one appeal cover all their bases with one appeal and if not
uh-huh
yeah that's a
yeah oh i'm sure
yeah
um-hum
i believe it is in capital i think in like lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever
however many is on sitting on a jury
i believe that's the way it is but i'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases
uh-huh
yeah
oh no
go one way or the other that that's probably an expensive trial
yeah probably
yeah i'm sure there's a number it's probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know
worth of all the
food for all
yeah
yeah that's been so long i've practically forgot who noriega was you know
that has been going on
my cousin is a fbi agent down in miami
she doesn't
no i haven't i never have my wife has but i haven't
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
okay
i guess they mean just one that's in your home
uh-huh
okay i guess that's like the ones in ti
oh in your home
oh
uh-huh
how do you know about building you own computer
uh-huh
was that a little less expensive
oh
huh
oh seems like it would be more fun any way my husband gets a kick out of building stuff for his self rather than buying it
no he's not into electronics i'm just saying per se he just likes to build stuff but
uh-huh
somebody to help
do you use your computer for home
uh-huh
is that for your house or for your office oh okay
well couldn't you like i'm pretty sure you can do this have it
one in your home that has the same stuff in it as your office does or have it kind of connect it
uh-huh
just contains a
okay
right
right
okay
you could just bring your disk home and do it
yeah
that was my problem in school i could not write programs
i loved messing with the computer though but i just could not
to a certain point i'd just get messed up and i would be totally lost
yeah i want i'm wanting to go back to school and this time i'll try a lot harder
uh-huh
well a lot of them more or less close the computers the
microwaves all have these new little buttons and
just about every thing is getting computerized
yeah have you seen that
thing that shows the maps
i think that's neat
uh-huh
okay now a friend of mine is trying is going for cpa and she is having to take
or she maybe it's just a preference that she's taking it on herself but she is taking a computer class
yeah
i do our income taxes too and you're right it probably would be a lot easier if i use the computer
uh-huh
uh-huh
and redo everything
right
huh
just me and my husband
so now i'm wanting for
my little boy's birthday is coming up and i was thinking about getting him just one of those little
i know they've got toy computers more or less just for kids who just starting and he'll be four
but i've seen it on like twenty and stuff whatever where they do have little
third graders and stuff working on
uh-huh
uh-huh
probably but i think that's the way it goes with most parents
uh-huh
a lot
go ahead
the main thing
i didn't i don't even remember them having computers on that little sheet
but
uh-huh well it's been pretty interesting so far
yes
all righty all right bye-bye
yeah i had five go through college we've put five through college uh-huh
two at texas a and m and three at north texas
right so
um-hum
right
right
um-hum that's probably your best bet because you know you narrow it down you're better off i think on that and
right
is he going on for his master's in his the engineering
um-hum
you almost need a master's in like if he's in engineering in his major right now one of his majors anyway right now to do anything with it
no matter what field you're in
well my daughter both daughters let me see one daughter was in business
and lives and worths works with autistic children um-hum and then the other one was a personnel director
down in houston for several years seven years and then my son is a cpa
and another has a business degree and then the fifth one is he was hotel management but actually he's in the sign business now and making signs
and likes that and has kind of hit on a nice setup with that so
he is local right here in richardson and he really loves it um-hum and it's just you know
that the type of signs they do is new in the last five years it's the latest thing in signs it's the type that you put on the
put on windows and it peels off and it looks like it's painted on
yes and he
yeah
so yeah so it's a nice deal for him yeah he has he's just starting in it but it seems to be a real up and coming thing
because everything's so portable anymore i mean you know things are not stable and people are renting places for a short times and they don't want anything permanent anymore so
it works out quite well
right
right
um-hum or on to a larger place and not put that much into anything permanent so it works out pretty well for him
it is it's wonderful it's wonderful
so
right
um-hum
for scholarships
and my daughters and sons both did that and they came up with some of the you know you would never think of applying for and they would apply for them well nobody else did and so they would get some
how do you mean
um-hum
yeah
yeah my wife and i have gone through a couple of decades together we're both on our early forties
so we sort of grew up together and just had children so we have a four year old and a two year old
and for the first eighteen years of our marriage we were two income you know careers and all that so we had a pretty full lifestyle and
and having the children we decided to go into one income so i work and she stays home
and it's you know the
the ideal value system is to motivate it there
because it certainly is something that
that we thought long and hard about
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah we've you know experienced a lot the turmoil of the sixties and seventies
and
yeah that too but i just think that
right now we're experiencing a lot of disappointment with our generation and
the way things haven't really changed and i think that you know our personal
difficulties are reflected in a lot of the unrest right now we're seeing with respect to politics
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah i mean maybe double that again in the east coast
we're just thirty miles outside of manhattan
and it's very different than the mid west it's
yeah i mean you know the kids around here
it it's a different perspective and you know we got caught up in that we had you know a real decade of hay day
an now we're retrenching like a lot of the rest of the country
particularly because you know we chose to have a single income and
also i work in a large corporate setting and that has become unsettled in the last
improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into management
and you're seeing them get elected to political offices not near enough i know there's still a long way to go especially in top management
you're not seeing you know looking at ti you see them in management but you're not seeing them up there as vps and i have a sister that's an attorney in oklahoma city and i know the company that she was with
the women didn't have near the positions the levels that the men attorneys had and were not given the same respect
yes
um-hum
right
right i also think that women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be it used to be people would say do you work and
you'd say no i work in the home and it was it was then it was almost like a put down particularly even by women in the work force
but i think now i think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very important and it's getting the respect and which is about time
yes very definitely
that's right
so you know it kind of does me good i think also one of the things that that's really tremendous and it doesn't necessarily have to do with women but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families which again i think helps the woman's role
you know
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
well i had to course i work full time but my daughter and her husband were out of town
so i had my grandchildren for four days during football soccer season
and so i would work and her some friends would take care of the kids but i would have to get them picked up from there get them fed get them to practices get homework done get baths i was absolutely exhausted and
and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties or early forties to have their first children i think are absolutely crazy
um-hum
where do i stand well if ten means absolutely no control i don't think i'd buy that but i guess i'd be maybe a six
i think that we probably should have a right to own guns if we're responsible
i myself own one i shoot nothing but paper targets
but i don't think anybody has the right to tell me i can't possess one i don't think
if i'm responsible my kids can't get a hold of them
and i certainly wouldn't use them for a crime i think the people who do use them for crime aren't the people who bother to get a license
what are your feelings
yeah i it is a
just picking it out of a hat
but do you feel that no one should be able to own any
okay well i don't know what the laws are in your state in order to get a license
i was thoroughly checked out it took over seven months to get myself approved
you need all kinds of references you they check your criminal record and all this other stuff they restrict
when you can carry it you can just take it to a range and back home again if you want to hunt you need a special hunting license
i myself am no fool i didn't want to hurt myself why would anybody want to take a chance it is a dangerous thing i took a national rifle association course on
how to handle one i keep it locked i keep the bullets somewhere else
i personally feel that if someone came into my house i'd be too much of a nervous wreck to shoot them accurately and i wouldn't want to hit my kids in case they were wandering around so i really have no
no thought to use it for protection i you know i'm more of the notion that a bad guy is meaner than i am and would use it against me
i think the guns that are out there hurting people are held by irresponsible people i don't believe that there should be
that you should be able to walk into your local supermarket and buy one i mean any bozo could get one then and then it would be indeed scary
i you know i just like the sport of shooting at a target it's the it's sort of like weight lifting it's something that you can judge yourself against yourself
and
i agree that the thought of actually putting a bullet into flesh is really revolting i mean i personally can't even see hunting you know i have no use for bambi there
right but i mean we get hamburger in a package and then we end up we forget it came from an animal but i choose to forget i'm a hypocrite myself
what would you think of the notion of you know just taking up a gun for target practice if you were trained does that revolt you in any way
uh-huh
did you feel unsafe
then it's too late
well you know i think it's i think
you talk to someone else they say yeah i think everybody should have a i should have a gun and nobody else should because i know i would act responsibly but you never know about the other guy and i think that's part of the reason why people are so fearful
because it's true someone might get drunk and not think
you know i don't believe in no laws i think that would be a scary kind of thing
but well that's how i feel
yeah me too i guess it's the east coast time you know everybody else is asleep
oh yeah i've initiated a few at the office like that and it takes a while during the day well it's an interesting topic wanna get going
okay
and we have in the corporate center where i work a health enhancement center hec they call it
and it's about as convenient as can be it's just two floors down from me
and so i exercise regularly during the daytime when i'm at the office
and
progressive weight machine that you know you dial up the weights on it it's not nautilus but it's similar to that and then they have bicycles and free weights
but they also have people who chart your progress and encourage you to come if you slip off for a couple of weeks they send you a nice friendly aggressive reminder that says hey we haven't seen you for a while
and they also provide towels and shower facilities and lockers and everything so
you i've been through the routine i guess like most people where you know i've joined health clubs i've been at the university where you know it's a pretty good distance away you know quarter of a mile walk and
nothing seemed to work for me as well as having it in my own building
doesn't work at home you know i've bought home exercise equipment and stuff and
when we're down there
yeah it just you know works out that way and there have been a lot of studies i have friends who
who work in the recreation field for companies like this and actually a break like that increases productivity and with the commensurate
increase in physical fitness by the people who attend these centers regularly you have fewer absentees and things like that so the corporation can justify it pretty well
and it's not like i'm taking time away from the company i probably put in extra hours because i'm now physically fit and
and that's what the kind of the late afternoon is i you know i have a very light lunch because i know i'm gonna be working out and you know usually then my lunch is just a quick tuna sandwich at my desk so then and i sort of skip that luncheon
um-hum
yes yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah we have the nordic machine and i tried it a couple of times it just made me feel stupid and uncomfortable and uncoordinated so i don't do that i it is used regularly by you know people but i didn't like it
um-hum
um-hum yeah it appears so i generally use the treadmill i kind of like it it's mindless you just get on and it's a way to sort of
reach a karma very quickly you know
well i believe that the voice that initialized this call asked about if we thought that it should be something that
should be put into action
yes i would be committed to that
because
oh definitely yes
i know that there are many countries that
are very successful with the operation of the government providing that plan
i'm not sure how their program is run but i know it has been successful
and i would really have to read the history of
probably i the country that has faired very well with it i'd like to see the
the data on that
well i
yes i think that's primary is if you have a good relationship
with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss
anything with him
and
oh absolutely that the choice would be yours yes if you felt that you weren't being
given the proper guidelines for your health
that you should be able to make a choice there
yes and the expense of that yes
well i would i would think that they would have that as part of the benefit
to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice
that you could select that individual yourself
and i'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor
and hopefully that they would have their
accreditations there too
yes
but those guidelines have to be set up and i think they should be voted on by the public
and
uh-huh
right yes
and of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be and
i think that's
primary for the health if they were going to have a universal health care plan
that they would have all the facts and the figures and
what it would mean to each individual family or and an individual
perhaps being single
i'm not sure what else that
we could address on health care
other than the fact i think
the eyes and the ears and the whole self should be
there's so many avenues that needs to be
undertaken in a program like that
i wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for
anything and not be covered by the program
uh-huh
and does he have an option if he doesn't care for the personality
oh i see
well if he's pleased with it i guess that's the bottom line
so but i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something
yeah cause there's always that opposite story there
uh-huh
it's quite different from when i was
under doctor's care that's for sure
i'm very thankful that i'm not under any doctor's care
yes
uh-huh what part of pennsylvania do you live in
near philadelphia
okay
are you a native pennsylvanian
okay so
i'm a former michiganian so
yes it is it's very lovely it's a very lovely state
uh-huh i'm sure it is uh-huh
uh-huh
that has broadened so much also
that is the fields that you know are opening up are
just phenomenal they
i mean look at the aids case you know i mean they
that's a whole new
field in itself it's just
it's an auto immune deficiency but it sure is a dilly one
yes i do too
to eradicate it entirely yeah
well there's guidelines that people have to follow and if they're determined to have their cigarettes and the other
carcinogenic causing items then
how do you teach them i guess you
that's true too it's i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it
yeah
well you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to
um-hum
well it's a bad habit that's
that
well it was nice talking with you
and
well you do the same and we'll be i guess talking around the country
okay you bye-bye
yeah i do i play basketball on a city league and
volleyball and
how about you
oh congratulations
yeah
uh-huh
huh
yeah
yep
i decided that i would just stay fit by doing team sports which is what i like more than just individual
probably
at least an hour a day
yeah do and i have four children so that keeps me busy too and they're all involved in
sports mostly soccer so we
once they're out there i you know i get out there and kick it around with them sometimes
where you don't exercise
yeah i just eat normally i don't you know i'm not real regimented about what
what i eat personally its too hard to get myself on a certain diet having to fix for five other people in the house so
yep
how about you
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
do you do it together with your wife or this mostly by yourself
yeah
yeah i was gonna say you probably get a lot of walking in i know that i when i went to college you know just walking back and forth from different buildings you have to
uh-huh
huh
i haven't
i haven't i do i have a bike and you know i usually have a child on the back of it because mine are little
uh-huh
that would be a yeah it sure would that would be a great idea
yeah
oh that sounds
yeah probably do your kids still live close by you
oh
uh-huh
oh they're spread around what did you teach
oh
oh
well that yeah well that would be interesting do you study like mammals or just sound
one of the main considerations is safety and quietness and economy what about you
well i have found most of the cars now are pretty reliable
i haven't found any that have left me down yet what are your specific requirements american or foreign
um-hum
do you have a family for comfort or
just you
well i had the same problem whenever i had a general motors car i had a chevy and
it was constantly giving me valve problems i had this constant ticking of the valves and i switched over to chrysler
plymouth
and i haven't had a lick of problem
yes
but just on the driver's side
i wish they would come out with them on the passenger side too
uh-huh
well i found out they're pretty good whenever especially on weather like we're having today and the roads are so slippery
the antilock brakes are one of the better ones to have
um-hum
my daughter has a
civic honda and that's a real comfortable car to sit in yeah which surprised me
i have a chrysler now i just bought and it's real comfortable
and i'm very happy with it but chrysler has a good warranty that they have to stand behind so i haven't had any
worries about that that's one thing i go for in a car is their warranty and
what does and doesn't come under that warrantee but they have the seven seventy thousand miles or seven years i believe
and bumper to bumper and i have no complaints
so far with mine
i sure would
dodge plymouth chrysler something in that line
um-hum
well
well that's another fallacy because so many people say that's a requirement has to be american
but did you know that my chrysler has foreign parts in it and so does chevy and so does ford
so i often hear people saying well i want to buy american or i like the foreign something and
they're built right here like the foreign cars are even built over here datsun has a
hello
um-hum
okay
no i don't and
i can't say that i'm unhappy that we don't or happy you know either way i guess not being not being involved in it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah you know i might i might see a case as well where it might be warranted in
someone who obviously had a problem with it someone who had well i won't say behavioral problems but
you know noticeable signs or you know got caught on the job you know in that case if they really wanted to help the employee it's sort of an enforced
enforced clean period but you know
yeah
i'd
that's true that sort of singling a person out i guess i could see that side it of it as well you can see i really haven't given it a whole lot of thought i'm i work for a privately held
systems integrator and
we are family oriented as a company and we don't have
no all everybody had to take one
random if it were gonna be done random would be the only way to do it otherwise you're unfairly singling someone out
um-hum
oh sure you have to be sharp
mainly the books i read are business related
or self improvement i've got a small company on the side
that i that i do things with so a lot of the reading that i do has to do with how can i do better at my small time business
important issues such as a you know taxes and
business expenses and all those kind things
i've got a small distributorship i
sell a
healthy cookie on the side
and i have a few health food stores that i send it to i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can so i can get a deal from the from the from the supplier
and then i distributed them and then i get i can sell them at a cheaper price plus i've got a drinking water system business that i've had on the side for years that i've done
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i haven't really read anything like that in years there was a time when i was really into the home things and i did had my own garden and i did canning all those kind of things that was when i was about ten years younger
and had
about ten years younger yeah
and the problem that i've had in the past with my children growing up and moving out of the house and still having three left at home out of the five i've
tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in reading more and spending more time at the library and it i've been moderately successful
with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books but they do read them
i have some books on health that i read all the time one's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing but yeah i i'm
uh-huh
there's a couple called oh i'm going to forgot his name now dirkson
and there's a book called life extensions i don't know if you've ever heard of it
okay it's a book called life extensions there's also a book called the life extansion extension companion dirk pearson and
oh i forgot sally's last name
anyway it's a couple i've seen them on tv
and they are pretty down to earth about
what you can take and what you can't take and
the quantities what are good for you what isn't and life extensions
yeah he's probably about forty years old now i saw him probably seven years ago on johnny carson show
and i was pretty impressed he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs
you know based on how well it was performing and then he embarked on this vitamin treatment and then every year he had the same tests run
and at the age of thirty two i think it was his heart was that of a fourteen year old
and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age
and of course sally isn't a very big woman i mean she's you know she appeared to me to be very petite and she took a horse shoe and turned it turned it into an s
and it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises
together they both exercised about five minutes a day doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
yes
yeah there's i've read a lot of things since i got involved in the water business back in eighty three and it's amazing that the legislation they have
for food that doesn't apply to water they don't consider water a food and the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldn't be able to sell it to you
through your pipes because it's toxic chlorine it's toxic it's a i don't know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer
they know that they've proven that
yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there that well you don't have to worry about dying from it the problem is that i've read books that
have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack
and if you look at the history of heart attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty
and we started doing large quantities of chlorination of water starting around where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water
uh-huh
yeah i'm very familiar with the area
it depends a lot of a lot of things were thought that as you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the
basically no
yeah i the policy that ti has i think is very fair
i
they first had a policy where they would test new employees and then since i've been with them the last four years there's been in the last year and a half they're doing random testing of all employees
yes
and it is it and from what i understand it is jerry junkins all the way down
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i like it because you know i grew up in the sixties i mean i graduated high school in sixty eight and
and you know i saw you know i know my friends who were you know druggies and friends who weren't and you know it's i think it's a real problem
and i think it and i think it's causing us a lot of trouble and a lot of problems
and so i'm hoping that a lot of other companies will follow the same path
probably not
uh-huh
yeah i used to be in dseg myself
a p d as a matter of fact
yep
very aware of it but i i'd i really like the idea in fact i would like to see a lot more people adopt it like you know school systems and that kind of thing
i mean i'd like i'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or
or who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs
yeah
and i like the idea that they have a system where they allow you to be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up
yeah
yeah rather than just
put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself
that's not going to help anybody get over the problem i believe it is a medical problem
yeah so i mean there's a lot of things out there and
things that
yeah
i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and stuff and i moved to a ti facility that had never had random drug sampling before
because they were outside of the military sector it was an industrial company and you know that ti purchased and so the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it
they were really opposed to it and you know there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs and that's why they were opposed to it
and it resulted in a few people leaving
you know because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy
you know they had a lifestyle and they weren't going to change it
and it's
yeah
why are we doing this well so you don't kill people on the road
especially some of the jobs
luckily i've always been in the engineering sector and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as you know hurting someone i mean it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it
but in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff
yeah i darn if i'd want somebody down there that i'm working with side by side you know that could kill me
by doing something incorrectly because they were
not exactly all there because they were on drugs
so there's a there's a lot of sectors where i think that would help out and i think in the long run we all benefit
i mean if you have
you know if you're not working with someone on drugs well then you're going to have less accidents and you have less accidents and you spend less money on medical and you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable
well then the company's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more if they can pay you more you can buy more and then and it and it goes around you know to everywhere
yep all over
and
it certainly does and
i just hope that more and more companies get on the ball and start it up
well a lot of companies are coming down in price and i think that the insurance companies are starting to give benefits
you know reduction in medical costs if you know they
yeah so i think everybody will benefit from the program
and i think if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say well if you impose
mandatory drug testing we'll reduce your insurance costs by you know twenty per cent and of course you know the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own
yeah and that'll cover it and maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a
as part of the package
yeah so it i think
i think all around it it's going to help out a lot course
yeah
it was great talking with you
you do the same
bye-bye
um-hum what kind of car do you have right now
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i know my father-in-law has have a has a turbo charged engine on his truck and he's had some problems with that
but he put the turbo on himself and
there was some problems right from the start with that
well i think it's probably about an eighty seven also
not real big car
but lately we've been trying to get something that's a little bit more reliable so we've been going with toyota vehicles lately
and i'm more into pick up trucks lately i got -self a pick up truck last spring
and i'm more interested in the off road that kind of thing hauling things around
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i know we do a lot of that on the road traveling and we have a toyota camry for that kind of traveling
that's a little bit more comfortable it's not real fancy but it's a lot more comfortable than a lot of the other vehicles we've had prior to that
um-hum
are you pretty satisfied with your jeep as far as repair and reliability on it
um-hum
yeah
yeah we just got that a few days ago here in wisconsin so
um-hum
yeah
well it kind of goes the other way with the vehicles that we've had because the toyota we have now was built in i think tennessee
and the
before that we had a volkswagen jetta which was made in philadelphia or somewhere in pennsylvania i think
so but you wouldn't think that just off the top of your head you'd think they're german or japanese made
yeah i read that in the paper the other day
found that interesting
we used to have a jeep a long time ago when we were first married and i swore i'd never get one again because we had so many problems with it was just a never ending stay at the repair shop it just
well the carburetion never really worked quite right and there
well we don't have children but from what our peers tell us most of them do are not in favor of the way the dallas public well i shouldn't get specific the way the public education system is run here
they just don't feel that the quality of the teachers and the quality of the curriculum and they actually send them to the suburban areas i guess it's okay if i say the area plano
and i think one thing that the state's doing right now about the refunding i think is completely unfair it's not that i
yeah
yeah is that the basic reason you don't agree with it
yeah
yeah and they're already paying for it i mean i you know i know we used to live in garland and a lot of the people there sent their kids to private school because they just didn't like what was going on
uh-huh
i know it i mean i look at high schools like what was the one in richardson j pearce high school that just won the national academic some kind of
championship or tournament that they had for academics and that richardson is one of the school districts that would be hit by taking away from them
that's a good way to say it the robin hood approach
yeah
you know i used to work at eds and ross perot you know the big joke sometimes about him but the one thing he did a few years back in testing the competency of the faculty
i still think that's a good idea
because i don't i don't know did you go to school in texas
and i went to school in chicago so i can tell you it's probably the same type of thing that i had a really good education but it wasn't where i went to high school it was an inner city but it the faculty was very good
and i don't know what
right
uh-huh
which is understandable i mean i'd go where i would be compensated the most
yeah i mean it's yeah in texas i don't know i don't if it's because of the influx of minority in terms of that they're trying to please all people and their not pleasing anybody you know i don't know if that's what it is
i don't know i'm not really
yeah i mean i don't know if that's exactly it or not but it seems to be a little bit more
well i don't know schools in wisconsin i'm trying to think of some of the things i know about the schools up north compared to down here
it just seems like down here that unless you're in a suburban entity their sat scores their reading comprehension levels they're just not as high
uh-huh
uh-huh
and mine was mine was completely hispanic in terms of puerto rican caucasian and eastern european
it was very eclectic but the teachers were what did curriculum i mean they had things like philosophy and journalism i mean
but there wasn't a real for people such as myself that knew they wanted to go to school and knew they wanted to go to a fairly competitive undergraduate program it wasn't what i would call a career a academic
student bodies in the country and the and the money base to go with it
i don't know i just look at high schools like plano east and west and the ones in richardson and i think well you know i would send a child there
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i mean my high school did have honors programs and i was in it but it really you know in terms of i'm wondering how much different it was compared to in terms of city now there is a high school
is it wtt white or is it jefferson i don't know that much about the dallas high school system but i have heard that the of one or two that are very good but out of how many you know fifty to sixty high schools
it's just and then i read the other day that plano was going to be the site for a possibly new parochial or catholic high school
something like to be one of the largest ones in the southwest or something yeah
uh-huh
do they see and are they in plano or are they in dallas
okay yeah that's one of the more yeah i have some friends that have younger children and they send them to the montessori system
oh my goodness
yeah twelve years and you add more than one child to that and you say oh my goodness yeah i
this is true yes i can personally relate to that yes
uh-huh i don't know i think one thing the united states does my stepfather's from england and one thing they do their at least in the section of london where he was from that they
they actually they call them externships but they actually the child's they go by forms they don't go by grades and i guess i guess
what would be the equivalent of our early high school nine tenth grade they call it the tenth of eleventh form
they actually are forced to take time off and pick an area of study it's proctored it's you know regulated and all that sort of thing but they actually are supposed to go to the library and do their own thing on a particular subject and it doesn't matter what it is
it has to be academic but they it's free of their choosing
right in that one just for that one particular semester quarter or what ever you know that one quarter a study unit would be
and i don't know i don't think we do enough of that here in terms of getting children to think independently
uh-huh
oh my
uh-huh
see yeah
that's kind of what i'm talking about i mean i mean we can only speak from personal experience and i'm not bragging either but it's the same thing i mean i took ap or advanced placement classes
and there were things that i probably knew about in other segments but they just didn't offer them i mean they offered them in things like english and chemistry
two things that were obscure to what i was interested in terms of a career
i think part of the thing about schools today is too is the way the families have gone down the tubes the structure that now teachers play police officers you know their parenting their disciplinarians
you know and i'm doing all this second hand we don't have any kids in school or anything so i can't
uh-huh
oh goodness
i mean i wouldn't want to be growing up now a days that's one thing but i don't know how you solve that you know those are social problems the academic problem i don't know i think of two or three things in my mind i think teachers should be tested
and they probably would shoot me if they heard that and i know a lot of teachers two i think that they should leave the funding or the money where the proven programs are
and three i do think that parents need to be more involved i don't know i just it's probably easy to say because none of us have children but i just
yeah
association
yeah
yeah mine too i mean and do they have those anymore i mean i don't even
i don't have any but you know just the other day we were somewhere actually on saturday we were in the park cities ordering in a we were in a specialty food shop ordering something to send out of state and
the man we were all upon the topic of adoption which may be in our future if we're real lucky at any rate he was saying how he was glad that his two children one biological one natural this had to do with the adopted one which
biological i mean one adopted one natural that's irrelevant but he was saying that my husband said and what does your son is very good looking what is he well he's nineteen he graduated last year but he's interested in theater and he's just going to richland and
he said you know he said i'm not calling him stupid or slow he just he said he did really didn't want to study and he goes and you know he leaned over to my husband and he said well you know so and so he said when you have them if you get one what you'll understand is you'll just be glad if they don't you don't get a call from the police
and he said our son mark you know blah he may be have only been a c student but we've never had trouble with him he said and when you raise a child in today's society he you're just glad they make it through school
is it see i don't even know that
uh-huh
yeah me too
through nancy dalgren she
she had somehow gotten the information from ti and was distributing it around
see i'm not sure that
i don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for
people to invade your privacy when they want to i think it's
well it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone it's completely trivial to for instance
and
let's see
well what's the first thing that comes to your mind
uh-huh
yeah i agree with you there for sure
and i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get you know it's possible for
almost anyone to get information about your credit history for instance if they just
twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company
it's you know possible for a thirteen year old
hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to
well
well yes well for instance yes and they'll probably goes into
other things like you know your records with
the government or utility companies or anything
since
not
not yet anyways because i don't think they're widespread enough but i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems
the
i mean society is going more and more electronic and there are certainly benefits to its doing so
and it's hard to hard to say whether the risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not
and i'm not sure
what can be done to ensure that they don't
why do you see any out for us
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i
uh-huh
just to pack the bearings
right
right and they repacked the wheel bearings
you know they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much and the surface material on the pads is so good
right
well
it sounds like you've had
some good experiences with that
and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that
i
i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car and
and in fact i have an eighty seven mustang with a 302 in it that i've beefed up a little bit
and one of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can
use more of the power to the rear wheels the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were
not even cast aluminum they were just pressed aluminum
well there's three there's three pulleys that you change you change the crank pulley and the alternator pulley
and the water pump pulley
so
when i changed those over i put on these pressed aluminum things
and
probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out
so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way
but not far enough to notice
so i was on my way to work one day and the water pump pulley split laterally in half
so there was a half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank and so i
fine
yeah
okay you go ahead
um-hum
in public places
yeah
really what is that
hm
yeah
yeah
yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months
you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months
you know it's crazy
yeah
well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that
so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really
i mean there are so many just major serial murders and it's not just like you know one instance or something it's just horrifying some of the murders that go on
yeah and the yeah there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that
yeah
um-hum
right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah
right rather than have to retrial the whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a you know a fortune to keep doing that
and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
well if i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really
you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side
and have some judge that was paid off or you know had a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power
but i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know
and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people
it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and that's it
you know
he'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something yeah
yeah
yeah
oh they'd have to move it to taiwan for people not to know about it practically
yeah
so yeah
i
mysteries murder mysteries true murder mysteries
and tacky romances
what do you what have you read lately
oh i got that the
the cradle will fall and
is that the right who's is that one
i've read i've read a few of hers i was just thinking i just read a trilogy of mary higgins clark
and that's so that's why i got confused but
and
i've read all of his
i can't oh it's been so long since i've read them but i will buy those in hardback
and
no is it a good book
where did you get it
uh-huh
uh-huh
so well i loved steel magnolias i heard it was similar to that
yeah that's one of my favorites
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
i might go get it because i i'm reading newsweek right now and i'm going to be finished in a minute and bookstop stays open till eleven
oh i don't do that i read those i read pretty quickly
um-hum
that could be difficult but
i read prince of tides i haven't seen that movie yet
yes it was
well i'll bring it next meeting
because i don't i don't have anything to do with them when i finish with them you can't sell them for anything
okay
i read some self help books but
and
at work yeah
i have neil by my bed
i don't have i've got three dogs
no
well yeah i do i do
they're in the front yard
um-hum
well what kind of car did you just buy a car or are you in the market to buy a car or
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum which is the one that has modular type seats you know which one i'm talking about they have the commercial on tv where you can you can pull some seats out and you can move around
is that is that the dodge caravan that does that or
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well the one that i can't remember one it is but it's the
if it's the toyota or
or one of the other ones i don't know if it's one of the americans or the import ones where they actually have like
some bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out i mean they're really easy to pull out
and you can move them around and stuff and it to me
that would be real good for us my husband and i like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a van which is it's an older van and we're thinking about buying another sedan
probably next year
right now motorcycles is takes precedence since that that's what my husband really wants right now
but next year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at possibly the honda accord
that's kind of
as far as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior but it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have
which is one of the things that we were looking at you know finding something that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want
yeah
uh-huh
so i think it's going to be a lot easier to be able to get a car now and finance it
i think banks are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i can imagine you got to kind of work that into your budget balance that and the house payment and of course is if you buy a new car you're going to are any of your kids driving age yet
are they twins
oh wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well the honda's have been have been very safe in accidents more so than a lot of the american cars as a matter of fact i just heard something today on the news about
those automatic seat belts that are attached to the door they're questioning the safety of those now
saying that and they showed a simulation where there they had a dummy in the car and the door opened and the dummy actually fell out of the car and the car rolled out on top of him
so they're saying they're not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but they're really not as safe as they as they appear to be
so
i'm kind of concerned about that as far as you know the seat belts
i don't know if maryland has a seat belt law but they do have one in texas and you're required to wear them
exactly but
ninety probably about well i don't know about ninety but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it
i know my brother doesn't and he has one in his car
so i mean it kind of gives you a false sense of security you think oh i've got one portion of my seat belt on
but if your door comes open
you know it's not going to do you any good
so that that's a concern of mine as far as what i'll be looking at with buying a new car
i'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door i think i would feel better with them attached to the actual car the inside where they're normally attached to like behind the door
uh-huh
hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah the le mans is like that too we used to have a le mans when i was in high school
and it was a big car i mean it was like the grand prix
and in i think around nineteen eighty
they changed the model and it like went to half the size
literally i mean it got chopped in half and it wasn't even the same car anymore didn't even remotely resemble the old car
yeah well everybody that i've talked to who's ever had a honda loves them and my husband had a honda
and it was a lease car and he had to turn back in a year and a half ago
and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it and it was great
and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because
we didn't feel the at the time the residual was like sixty five hundred dollars and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for
a four year old car
so
so we ended up just went just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and got out of the lease
one thing that i that i am curious about is reading information on air bags do some of the vans i think i don't know about the dodge caravan but some of the vans now have driver side air bags
which i think is a good idea
how about you what do you do with your budget
uh-huh
yeah that's true
yeah that sort of a problem
we're trying we're trying
to
so far we are in the clear credit wise but the other side of it is
so
and stuff like that but
yeah we'd like to do that some day we have this dream
but we don't know how long it will be a dream
we we're kind of real we're really happy that we don't have any debt
but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this
economy right now so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month
we're missionaries actually yeah uh-huh
and it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have like support quota
and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
so
africa nigeria
yeah
about four years we're career so we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year we go over four we come back for a year
we're with wycliffe bible translators
so
yeah they could very well and
we will be i was over for four years doing language surveying which is the first step you're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need and
came home and got married and we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family
as translators well i always wanted to do translation
but as long as i was single and footloose so to speak it's easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could
you're free to travel anywhere you don't have kids hanging around you and stuff
well i have a smattering of about ten different ones but there's i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know since i did
you know complete a survey in one area i'd switch to the other so i know the greetings in about ten
and how to do market stuff but in about
about five i guess i can do better in it and my french is pretty good but it's senegalese french so i'm terrified to speak it in
in france yeah because they're real snobby about their language and senegalese french is street french and
i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didn't know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and
said something here when i came home and french to somebody and he paled and said i'm not going to tell you what you said so
i don't know what i said to him but i didn't ask him either
well i just bought a home so i've just now went out and purchased my brand new lawn mower and so i've been assembling it and haven't had a chance to get out there and test it out
no it's an older home and so it already has the yard's already been established but
there have like big oak trees in the front and so the grass is not growing out underneath the oak trees so i'm have to get out there and do something about that you know spread some seed and fertilizer and stuff
oh uh-huh
oh okay
um-hum uh-huh
right
right
um-hum
oh uh-huh
hm that's an idea
um-hum
yeah that's true that's true yeah i have in between the street and the sidewalk see are two of the oak trees
and then there's one sitting on the facing the house on the right hand side in the middle of that whole section and then i have this whole section over there that has nothing in it at all but just the grass
so that may be an idea to do is because i've got that concentration of trees right there is to you know just do something like what you said was to put some kind of little plants that does well in shade the shaded area
and forget about you know trying to plant grass and stuff underneath that
the other thing too is that the oak trees have those acorns and i don't know if i'm going to have to go out there and if i can rake those up or if i'm going to have to pick them all up by hand or what
for privacy fence so i did buy a weed eater too and so i could get you know around the wooden fences and you know get all the weeds and stuff up out of there
um-hum
right
um-hum
wow so what did you did you use do you have a blower or did you have the vacuum
um-hum
huh
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh yeah that i've never i don't think i've ever seen a vacuum though for the for the lawn i know i've seen the blowers
who was it
oh craftsman uh-huh
huh
uh-huh ooh that'd be good i think that's my problem is i couldn't believe because i guess the other people they weren't really outdoor type people because the lawn really needs to be
i have bushes and stuff that really need trimming and so
so i'm just thinking how in the world i was going to have to scrape up all those acorns that are sitting out there they even have some little trees growing
because they just left them the acorns i guess sit rather than raking them up so you know i'm going to have to get out there and
but it was interesting i had to go buy a hoe and a rake i mean the whole works because i've lived in an apartment for so long i've never had that kind of equipment so that was that was interesting to go down there and get all that kind of stuff
yeah
right so this has been this has been an experience for me
and but i can't wait until we have some more time to get out there in the front yard and really do you know a lot of landscaping
because i want to cut down all the trees that they or the little shrubs that they have because some of them are like
they have the new green leaves i don't if it's getting green up there where you are but they're almost fully
blossomed and but there are like sides of them where there're like whole dead portions of the shrubs
and so i've been debating of whether or not just to cut out the dead portions or you know just to take it all out and i think i've pretty well decided just to take it all out and start all over again
well it's not too bad i mean i thought they were pretty reasonable but i don't know i have nothing really to compare it with you know four or five dollars for a for a shrub
i don't know and i hadn't really wanted to get that many you know to put out there i much prefer flowers
um-hum
um-hum
wow
um-hum
um-hum wow
it's true it's true just picking up the equipment that i have
you know and i didn't blink an eyelash that's what got to me when the man you know said and that'll be five hundred and something dollars you know with my big new lawn mower and stuff i was just okay you know so yeah you're right you're right you can i think you can go through quite a bit of money
i think it depends too where you buy it from if you buy it from a nursery or we have like home depot here i don't know if you have that there is
yeah
local
uh-huh
there you go that's right that's true i understand that
well it was nice talking to you
well thank you
oh okay talk to you bye
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
out of the question yeah
yeah i went through the same thing i
i you know we do a lot of hunting out here and stuff and you know rifles and stuff we've never had a problem with handguns sometimes i wonder because
you know what do you do with a handgun i mean you don't you really you can't hunt with it
i mean you know you can know how to treat them or you know how to use them properly but i just have a you know i don't think there ought to be a outright ban but i think there ought to be some more restrictions on handguns rather than rifles
just because it's so much easier to conceal a handgun it's easy for a kid to get to it and you know hurt himself with a handgun i think more so than even a rifle
yeah did you hunt much out there or in kansas or
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah
well that you know really gets into that rights thing i mean there's a fine line i guess in everything and gun control is one where
you know if you could get some proper training and education it's
you know i think you'd find that all the accidents would definitely go down and i you know i remember taking hunter safety and i was like eleven or twelve years old
i mean before my dad would take me out deer hunting at all even you know even though i wasn't hunting
i had to know how to handle a gun and
i think you're right though you know a lot of the inner cities and stuff like that they just don't get that kind of training
and
and i you know i'm a i the only that i hate is well along with that training is i when kids have accidents with guns i there's a lot of stuff coming out now that they're going to start holding the parents responsible for not
making the gun safe and i think there's a lot to that because kids are just naturally curious and then and you know when they're five and six years old accidents will happen that's why you know they need to be locked up the ammunition kept separate and all kinds of stuff
yeah
well i mean i don't i have a real hard time with even keeping a loaded weapon in my house
you know you hear you hear somebody come in your house and you're a lot better off letting them take about whatever they want if they're there to steal something rather than take a chance be the hero and get shot or something i
you know i just there's nothing more valuable than life itself so
but
yeah i definitely i you know was reading the article on
well on this ross perot you know how he's talking about running for the presidency and i guess he's a conservative you know he's more of a republican politically but
he's got he had some wild ideas about gun control i guess he's really he's for gun control big time and he was saying how he would go in for some
some unwarranted searches and seizures of any guns that aren't registered and that really surprised me i like i say i wouldn't want that to happen
um-hum
yeah
i yeah i understand he was pro he was he was for abortion rights
and i was really like i say it really surprised me because most of those guys i mean from that the conservative end they are just i mean gun control one hundred percent the nra is their best friend and
the best lobbyist so i was kind of surprised to see that but you know i think though on the outside too the nra sometimes goes overboard you know
and handguns are just fine and i just think you know there's some middle ground there to where
that they maybe go overboard and do too much they i guess they do have a lot of lobbying power and you know their big thing is well if you stop banning one type then it's going to lead to the next and so on and
yeah and i you know i
i'm trying to think off hand i can't think of anything you know
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
oh i wouldn't either no
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh really
um-hum
um-hum well how do you get your name off the junk mailing list
uh-huh
oh really
oh i didn't even know that
oh wow
yeah
um-hum
yeah
i can't really think of anything that invades my privacy but one of my pet peeves you came up with the telephone is
when you have an answering machine and they hang up before
they leave a message
i can't stand that
i think that is so stupid you know because
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
i don't like how they the i realize that this is your identification but i worked with someone that got hold of his charge cards and his social security number
and you know i don't i don't like i don't ever get anything over the phone because i don't want to give my social security number out
um-hum
yes
um-hum
oh i never even knew that
um-hum
um-hum well is there any like pet peeves that you have that don't necessarily invade your privacy
oh okay
i really can't think of any that would invade my privacy
you know
hm no i you know i really can't say anything that would really bother me
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah especially between women and you know like age and all that stuff
you know with you know your sex you know
no because i think it's for the better of like you mean like for working and stuff
no i don't because i think whenever and something like that they're looking out for everyone they're not you know i think it's more safety than anything else
yeah because i know
yeah because i know i worked at a steel mill in this summer
and i know that i've covered for people that came in drunk you know on the late shift or something
and it and it's dangerous i don't even like having them around i kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them
you know
do you follow football very much
no i guess kids are out
i said kids are out
yeah
oh i follow the cowboys but that's about it
but i try to catch the game every weekend that i can
yeah have you ever been to a cowboys game
it's pretty nice
that's good at least you follow the game a little bit
oh i see what school are you going to
byu oh okay
leslie what are you studying
nursing great my mom's an lvn
yeah
um-hum
yeah she loves it she really enjoys
no she's a nurse in san antonio
but she's been she's been working a late shift she works the i guess the graveyard's what you'd call it she works the graveyard shift
and she's worked that for oh years when i was small
i guess probably going on twenty years now
and she really enjoys it she likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night and
and
she's
and she's really enjoying herself she really likes it
hm well good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree
think you'll like it you plan on staying in the dallas area
san antonio in particular has got a large base of hospitals
i don't know about dallas i think dallas is pretty scattered
no i'm in dallas but i'm originally from san antonio
and they've got a large medical center down there they've got the ut health science center out there also
so if you ever wanted you know pursue anything more than your nursing degree that that'd be the place to do it
um-hum oh great
great
well like i said good luck to you
all right well take care and maybe we'll meet up again sometime
okay bye-bye
so the question is how do we keep up with current events
as a matter of fact as you called i was taking a look at the san francisco examiner
yeah
i watch the macneil lehrer news hour fairly regularly and the network news less often
and will watch some of the talking heads programs on pbs
and that's pretty much about it we don't get time or newsweek
and as a matter of fact i don't get any of those sort of magazines anymore
yeah do you watch the network news
yeah out here they're moving it to a seven o'clock well they're moving the prime time schedule up from
eight to eleven which used to be eight o'clock at night till eleven o'clock at night now to seven to ten
and i guess the network news which has moved up in time out here
will move up on all three of the local network affiliates
i was just reading as a matter of fact about the news coverage of the movie jfk have you have you
it the i didn't realize this but dan rather at cbs was the first person to view this zapruder film that was actually made of the assassination
and he had viewed it the day after and got it completely backwards in terms of what had happened that was significant because of the obvious contention that there were two gunmen at least and not one
and it's really and he rather later admitted that he'd gotten the key piece of evidence backwards that he'd argued like a lot of other people that kennedy had lurched forward
after the shot and he'd in fact been forced backward which lends credence to the two
to the two gunmen conspiracy theory have you seen the movie
i haven't either
yeah
it is you know i are you one of those people who believes that it was not a lone gunman that we just never really got the full story
yeah i haven't seen the movie either but i think most of us in this country believe that it just doesn't make sense that it was one guy
and
well that's what oliver stone's seeking to do and i think it's really interesting to look at this because i think it kind of gets at the question of how people get their news sometimes
really important news comes to people through movies
through television
yeah and i think that's really interesting i know that my wife and i were talking about
how much attitudes toward women and the relationships between men and women husband's and wives are changing and i think people get more of that information
through television sitcoms than they do through reading the newspaper
that was the topic of yesterday's t i conversation and i think it's really interesting because i think all of those things wind up carrying the message and i think
it's gonna be real interesting to see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be able to get via cable television and computer services
so much so much more than we can possibly consume in the way of news
i came up here i was working for a unit of at&t and was promoted i came out to california to go to graduate school and was hired out of the phd program in southern california
and went to work for a unit of at&t and they promoted me and moved me up here and we liked it my wife is from san diego
live right out by the park right off lindley meadow in golden gate park
yeah
yeah what took you to texas
yeah
oh yeah
uh-huh and you grew up in walnut creek yeah how long have you been in texas
that's do you like it
that's a i hear a lot of good things about texas
it's big it's probably more affordable housing it's
yeah
i well i the we live yeah living here it's just it's
off and on well i guess i've been kind of off and on i've
had some health problems that have led me to stay more on than off
i do walking on the treadmill and then i do low impact aerobics
yeah and time consuming i mean it's
it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming it's you know afterwards you know then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know
hum-um
yeah it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't you don't have any excuse
yeah i can't ride a bike so
oh
yeah it's too nice been too nice of a weekend
you had any injuries from jogging
i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it's very hard on your body and that you know
um-hum
yeah that's not quite so easy yeah
i found that true especially for walking on toes or fronts
so
yeah
yeah well don't let it collect dust you
least exercise while dusting it off
yeah that that'll be good
um-hum
oh
um-hum
so are you gonna do that
well that sounds like something good to do then
yeah
nice way to start off the spring
get back in shape
well i do i switch every other day one day i walk and one day i do the aerobics
yeah it takes it's it takes longer to get the same effect yeah but
my walkman broke so i'm upset now i just have to turn the stereo up real loud
no i just do it on tv i have a cassette
it's a it's a i use tapes
uh-huh
there was one guy i used to watch on espn i don't know if he's still on it anymore or not i don't i don't know if i get espn or not
but well yeah i used to watch one on the air but that was back
that was yeah
yeah but then that was back when you know the high impact and
i'll have to check it check it back up then the thing is everybody always looks so good on there show least on some of the other ones not everybody has a picture perfect body
i haven't watched any other ones on tv just on some of the tapes so
i'll have to okay thanks
now that's a thought
never i've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors
you haven't huh if you were what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers
i think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial
and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or what but
sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion
hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides
tv shows
no i think there are certain things that the jury can determine as far as guilty or not guilty but as far as the affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature
the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of penalties and fines and punishment
um-hum
that's true but i do like the idea of the jury being the people who decide in the matter of if it's a jail term versus life and death
you know the death penalty and such
uh-huh
right
yeah it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in jail
although you still hear about those occasionally
i don't know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the tv show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial
and i think it was like on one of the documentary tv shows where they ask for the verdict by the jury
and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent
and they took it more as just like a majority
so i
exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous
but
rather interesting
uh-huh i did i did also
uh-huh
what about in international
trials do you think they should have a jury there i think that would be kind of interesting
i guess the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts
like you know the old day with the rack we they're going to say okay you're guilty and you have to pay kuwait four million dollars well whose going to really make them
nobody
so
in as international law also
um-hum
right
i don't know how what it what it would take to be come up with a true perfect
system or if one exists but
i guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature
i
yeah that serves a kind of if they're i guess if you sentence someone to life is only forty nine years something like that
and i guess you're eligible after twenty seven for parole even though you're in for life
yeah although i guess it's your you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time
no because inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation it just
yes it's another war zone
but
who knows
i agree get them out there
sure they should have them go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of kind of work out of them
exactly
trading their lives for cigarettes
those kinds of things
well good
i think so
nice talking to you also
have a wonderful easter
bye
why don't you go ahead and start
i used to i sewed you know in high school and when i went to college i think everything in my closet i had made but i haven't sewed since then and that's been fifteen years
so you know i didn't have access to a machine the whole time i was in college
and then just in the last you know ten or i just haven't sewn anything i would love to i would like to get back to it
yeah
it is you know an even back then i remember you could make something for you know half what it cost to buy and of course the quality was just exceptional
now it's a little more expensive to make it because you know you start paying the price for the patterns and the material but it's still such better quality that i think it's worth it
you're kidding me
see i can remember paying seventy five cents for a pattern
um-hum
good night well do you have kids and a husband are you sewing for a whole family or
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well and that always is helpful for starters you know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going
that's true well do you do anything do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that
see i'm i've not ever been a real craft type person i have a sister-in-law that i mean if it can be done with your hands she does it she makes things for the kids for christmas and nephews and nieces and i look at them and i think
god you know i should be able to do things like this
yeah
yeah
well when my sister oh when my sister had her first child my niece and this is we're talking fifteen years ago i was it was my last year of college
and i asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares so she did and i crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby
and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time
but
fast
i don't think so
sure
uh-huh
you're kidding so like as you're sewing the seam it's finishing off the inside edge
well that takes all the work out of it
well how neat
uh-huh
well that's neat
for the machine yeah
do you paint or anything like that
never
oh so do i
well i have one here it's the one that i grew up with and my folks gave it to me and a couple years ago when they sail and so they sold their home and they they've been sailing and
so it's here but i haven't touched one like since college so i kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again and of course my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it and i'd love to teach them to play too
yeah
you do
well i figure it takes practice and i don't i say i don't have the time that's not true by the time i put my kids in bed at night i don't want to do anything
i you know i've worked all day and i come home and i do that i and you know even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that i think gee i could do this or that i have an hour here i don't want to do them sometimes i'm too tired
now the part about sewing that i never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out if somebody would lay it out for me
then i didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it i could do that all day long and i can remember once in high school i wanted some extra money
but i hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias and
yes on the grain of the fabric
yeah
well what are some of the other features on this machine it sounds wonderful
oh okay
is that for designs or is that for the regular seam in the fabric or
oh okay
uh-huh
so it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do
uh-huh
so the serger is not a sewing machine itself it's something that goes with it
like an attachment or
oh okay
uh-huh
well i'm going to have to go check it out that's just something i hadn't heard of but it
i go in spurts unfortunately i can't get as regular and dedicated as i probably should
where you where you are you'd probably have to you know the weather probably doesn't cooperate with you so you would have to belong to a gym or something and
yeah
well growing up i was always
fairly athletic and always
you know i didn't really have to
think about an exercise routine because i was always doing something that more or less required exercise
but i've been in a job lately where i've been working some really long hours and some nights and weekends and
yeah sure
everybody i know that belongs to a health club here in dallas the better ones are always crowded at the times when you'd be more you know more likely to use it like right after work or
you know during lunch hours or you know right before work and that sort of thing so people end up exercising at really odd hours and i can't exercise you know late at night because it keeps me awake
i mean you know once you
you know it's got a lot of different stuff on it and i mainly got it because you know like i say since i've gotten so out of shape and everything i forget and i'll do something
not thinking about that i don't have the muscle to do it anymore and i injured my rotator cuff on one arm really badly and the doctor was kind of like well you know you're gonna have to
you know i got this machine to try to because i one thing i did kind of keep up doing was i like to walk
and i like to ride my bicycle so when the weather's okay you know i can do that but you know having to
and some stuff like that it it's all i can do just to force myself to turn around go back out and do that kind of stuff
so you know
is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody
but
other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty
um-hum so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers
i think i'm
yeah they say you get the government you deserve
um-hum
so you're taking a government course at what at the university
oh okay
you can make laws against corruption but that doesn't eliminate it does it
yeah i've been around to a few other countries and i have not found one yet that i would rather live in i think
yeah but if you think about it now with what interest rates are doing i mean they are so low and yet the majority of the credit card companies still have
you know eighteen percent some of them even higher
and you know it it's some of them are almost usurious
so
right
yeah it's like my atm card
but as of my last bank statement i had gotten some cash from another location and they charged me two dollars
for that transaction which i thought gosh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah well that's not a bad deal i to i had a card one time that
when you know one of these things without my asking they sent me a package you know notifying me that i was such a value a valued customer that they had put forth this line of credit for me
and
you know without reading the small print i found out it was some pretty expensive money before it was all over with because whenever you accessed it through the card
they tacked on a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldn't have been quite so expensive
all right well we're supposed to talk about cars
gosh
yeah
uh-huh
well i'll probably look for a family type vehicle like a mini van or something because
i've got two i just i've got two young ones so we're looking for something that's more family oriented yeah something bigger that we can carry
six
yeah right
right
hum that's right near me
yeah plano's a few miles north
who does he work for
oh really corporate office
huh i've got a i'm taking a class and one of the guys that's in my group that
we're doing a group presentation he works for jc penney
three years they're moving their offices to plano right now
well that's good
well that's great
yeah
huh
that's super
hopefully they'll i think the unions really screwed american cars up they
or yeah the gm plant that they have down here that they're thinking about closing
the average worker there makes twenty two dollars an hour and that's you know that's more than a lot of people make you know professionals make
yeah i didn't either
yeah
sure
yeah
sure
yeah
yeah my gut feeling is to
it i have to say that i
from my political point of view
regulatory controls on things and i think that when you have situations where an a working individual could do damage for instance a an airline pilot
you know or somebody who's driving a public carrier like truck drivers and stuff like that i think that there is a far more substantial issue
at hand but i think there other ways other than doing things like drug testing to monitor the way people behave i think a for instance a good manager should be able to tell that somebody's got a personal problem
it would seem to me pretty easy to tell if their performance was suffering for it
i don't know how do you feel about these things
um-hum
um-hum
sure and that could ruin somebody's life
even if they were vindicated
sure
um-hum
well i have to say i'm a child of the sixties and it you know i grew up and when i was young i flirted around with some of that stuff like a lot of my friends did and i saw a lot of my friends ruin their lives or not really
i don't know i guess i saw a couple of friends ruin their lives that sort of thing but i didn't see most of them ruin their lives with it in fact most of them went through it like a phase like
you know most teenagers will drink for a little while and then when they you know have to start you know working and that sort of thing they tend to cut it back to drinking on the weekends or whatever
and they become adults about it
and in fact my attitudes about the kinds of drug problems that we have in this country
are that i think that the government should administrate it in a you know in a completely different manner i think it would be a
a good source of revenue i think there's some evidence about the way this stuff has been handled in europe that shows that it can be controlled in different ways but that's sort of moving off the topic at hand here and i you know the
fact of the matter is i think that issues like this really
really are i mean to a certain extent they involve the whole question of liberty and a person's right to privacy and that sort of thing because you know i mean
yeah and it i you know the fact of the matter is i think that an adult responsible worker doesn't want to
have this kind of thing in his life if it's going to have an impact upon his ability to make a living and you know and keep his livelihood coming in
sure and so you know it's i so anyway i guess that we're largely in agreement in that
case and in fact i think that because you know i mean i it's literally i you know i'm in my late thirties now and it's easily been almost
jeez man maybe twenty years almost since i last had any of that sort of stuff around me but at the same time i don't think that necessarily gives me a right to
i have pretty strong feelings about it yeah i think that guns ought to be controlled
well let's see on one to ten i guess i vary i actually started out as a member of the nra in my youth
but having looked at murder statistics in other countries it's so dramatic that i think that i'm probably down to about a two or a three
in terms of control however no i'm sorry maybe up to a nine or a ten
open the almanac one day and it just has murders of by guns and you look and you look at european countries and it's like six eleven four and you get to the us and it's four thousand
and that tells me something about
yeah that
that's i mean the other problem is there's so many guns out there if you ban sales of guns right now there'd still be millions and millions and millions of them
but
would it would really be nice to make it a little harder to get one so that every punk in the world doesn't pack a rod
yeah
right
yeah
if enough people want it and they're willing to pay for it they'll get it
yeah
yeah
but
but i went out and bought it intending to learn to use it and so on but i never did
yeah i mean i certainly just walked into the store and bought mine and a box of bullets i suppose i could have gone and blown my own brains out or anyone else's who was who was nearby
although i must say i have a healthy respect for the thing
yeah
yeah it's
it sort of amazes me that in the gulf war people were really concerned about ten or twenty or thirty or a hundred people dying and if a thousand people died in that war it would have been a mess and if five thousand had died
it would have been considered a national calamity and yet that many people die from gunshot wounds i mean i think that we have our values in a in a sort of in a funny place
yeah i mean in some in some fields we seem to have this really profound respect for human life
and in other fields we don't i think guns and automobiles are the two places where we're willing to take our licks
but you know we're willing to accept sixty thousand highway deaths a year
yeah
yeah in some areas but i think in other areas
i don't know i guess this gulf war came to mind where
and
but you know we'll go all out to save a child with a rare disease who makes the newspaper will get millions of dollars in contributions and all kinds of medical aid because that one life is considered so precious
when it's viewed somehow when it's viewed in i don't know as a single life it becomes very precious and when you view it as a statistic whether it's guns or automobiles or smoking
people just don't see those as individual lives somehow or they don't they don't relate to them personally
yeah
yeah
yeah it
yeah they are and it's really changing the social structure of things i know i went out with a bunch of people
i don't know six or seven people and we were just sitting around drinking beer and the waitress asked us which one was driving she didn't want to
wasn't going to serve that person anything
hm yeah i didn't think about that i sort of thought that
yeah i thought that was the case i mean if my kid grabs my gun and goes and shoots somebody i would really have the feeling that they're going to come banging on my door
huh
hum
yeah
yeah it's well it's just too late i mean there are countries i've lived in both japan and england where guns are not available even criminals don't carry them or it's so hard to get and the
and the law is so severe for people caught using them that by and large they don't
yeah
yeah
yeah
well yeah that's a point although if that's the case why are we spending all this money on all of this high tech weaponry i wonder
right
all right ron
total gun control
yes i agree something should be done but i there i don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons because
crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct
will have access to weapons from somewhere
and that means they'll always have an advantage over us and they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself now
you know i agree with a lot of things you just said in your few moments because personally i used to be a great hunter and in the last few years i've said no way matter of fact if i find a
a fly running around in the house i pick him up and carry him outdoors i don't even hit him with a flyswatter so i've gotten over this bidness of wanting to go out and shooting and killing and that sort of thing
but i think that personally that we do need some
weapons available to most of the people most of the people really are honest and
worthy of carrying on their lives properly i'm sort of in line thinking in terms i don't see anything wrong with this five day waiting period if the waiting period
is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon
i mean there's nothing wrong with that do you see anything wrong with that
right
yeah i'm against this automatic and semiautomatic stuff i don't think we should have access to those
no
hm
yes and the people should be selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're not acquiring weapons for illicit use
that is not good there's nothing wrong with a person that enjoys the mechanisms as a matter of fact there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who brought to me a target
from a rifle that he
pretty well halfway designed and he and he put together the bullets in it and he was showing me that at a hundred yards he kept five shots
within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards now see from a technical point of view that is something that our military people need to know about
so there are other interesting facets in guns and weapons this is a bolt action rifle i think he has and he has done other things to the way the barrel sits in the
the wood part of it and he designed the bullets themselves and he has fantastic accuracy
just from a technical point of view that interests me not to kill anybody with it or anything with it but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
no
oh yeah
yeah i went and saw boat today i about flipped over it
i'm not i'm not sure what kind it was i saw it just sitting on the side of the road
oh yeah no doubt about it
yeah
oh yeah
that sounds neat
at least you have weekends off
oh i know i know i don't have that luxury yet
yeah i am in the restaurant business i run restaurants and didn't really don't really have that time off yet so
yeah this one's big too
oh that'd be great
i think i could probably handle that
for awhile
well that'd be great
who cares about sanity though
i know it no telephone no fax machines nothing
oh that's true
that's good
seven that's about the right age
yeah
oh yeah
yeah i sure do
oh really
huh
that's kind of different
yeah i kind of i kind of enjoyed that boat i looked at today it's nice and clean it wasn't yeah it was not that old
no it didn't it's open up front had a little and it was open in the back too in the back kind of had a little
deck in the back of it also
yeah it was kind of different i thought
yeah it was
rather i do not know how big it was or anything i was just looking at it and until i got around to the for sale sign
fourteen thousand
yeah
pardon me
no it couldn't have been that old it's
yeah
i said that's enough
yeah i know it
where do you all where do you all go skiing
oh i know it
yeah that's true
somebody was talking about that at one time they were talking about
was it one hundred fifty a month
something a hundred twenty a hundred twenty a hundred fifty a month oh i know it
yeah especially on water even
yeah everybody's got to make a buck though
the name of the game i think
working around the working around the water and take off on the boat anytime you wanted to
well that's good does he know how to work on them or just minor stuff
yeah
yeah
that's true
took it in and got it got all of its shots right
oh i know it or that time off one of the two
yeah it helps it helps
oh i know it
man it's supposed to be
myself
all right take care
bye-bye
my most recent woodworking project was i made an oak trash can
it's the new thing around here is people
want trash cans which match their kitchen cabinets
so
yeah i really am in the telecommunications business but you know
one has to do what you can do to make a buck
i got well your basic stuff your radial arm your table your drill press
what i don't do is i don't i don't turn
you know it
you know i build boxes as people say
uh-huh
oh yeah i am i don't get either one i look through them at the at the newsstand and buy them on occasion
i get a
a newspaper called the workshop news and i get a
let's see i can't read the side of it
woodsmith i think it's called
monthly sort of brown paper type of type of thing
oh yeah oh i've looked through both of them you can just only afford to subscribe to so many
there's an
uh-huh
yes
now there you can get upside down and backwards doing crown molding
i made an armoire
recently for my wife's store
and the top of it has curved crown molding
that will
well
what you had it wasn't what i did was i made it up out of the crown molding around the top and the tricky part was not making up the crown molding it was how did you cut it how did you miter the corners
uh-huh
no i don't build it if somebody is not buying it
i mean i build a i have a stock english garden bench which i make
which i instead of making out of redwood which is really dear on the east coast
is i make it up out of your regularly old forty cpi pressure treated lumber
and then paint it
which saves on the cost
yeah teak is awfully expensive but the thing about teak is you can't set it on the ground
you have to set it like on flagstone or concrete or something
it it's all right outside if you go out every year and you know oil it
but you know the old green pressure treated you can ignore it if the paint falls off it's still not going to hurt the wood
you know the paint's only just to cover up the fact it's green
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i don't do a whole lot of that i've done some
i one nice thing about living in this area is the smithsonian is nearby
and they have you can call them their restoration lab
and they're happy to talk to you
so you might file that if you don't mind paying the long distance charges
their restoration labs will be very are very happy to talk to you and say you know and you say hey i've got on what do i do now
yeah it's very close to the mall it's actually located in the
yes we do we've started out with
all the waste haulers have been authorized or commanded i'll put it that way to pick up lots of
different kinds of waste
and they
the result has been that they have increased their rates by about three times
and so
now you have all kinds of things that they didn't use to pick up like magazines and
various forms of
glass tin and things like that
i think it's
plastic and glass well plastic and magazines which in the past nobody picked up
yes
yes well now these so they're
we're being charged because the rates have the trash pickup rates have gone up like i say almost by a factor of three for some people
the city council did it they decided that there was
portland is kind of a
ecology minded area and so they
although there're some complaints because the
there were volunteer agencies that would do it at a minimal charge and a lot of the
the articles in the papers or the letters in the papers these days have suggested that the waste haulers now that they have a monopoly
they charge
much more exorbitant rates than the than the volunteer you know you pay to have your magazines recycled that kind of thing
in the past they said well we were paying far less to have our magazines recycled than we do now
because the waste hauling companies have a monopoly now
so they can you know it's the old thing about now that i have to do it they can
they don't have to work very hard at keeping costs down
so how about your area
of course around here we have to pay for our trash pick up
oh i see what you're saying
the thing that has another thing that's been in the press here has been
that with the volume of recyclables coming in the prices have dropped so that they can't even pay for the
how should i say it the market can't absorb
all of the
right and certain kinds of glass the green glass has no market it's piling up
i don't know where they get green glass i guess they get it from
okay
uh-huh
aluminum cans
do you recycle newspapers or anything
i think they would
right how about glass jars those are recyclable but
huh
uh-huh
honey i'm on the phone long distance
had to yell at my kids had to yell at my kids
well i have four
and we try and recycle my husband is in the packaging business and they use recycled newspapers shredded up
for the filler for it's a pad that they put on top of apples boxed apples when they ship apples and it absorbs some of the you know the when the apples get the shipping you know
oh he does for what company what trucking company
oh that's great well he may have some of our apples then probably washington's a very big apple growing
place especially yakima you'll have to look for yakima washington on some of the box labels and cvc weyerhaeuser that's us
that's us well so they have a recycling actually they it's called central washington recycling and they have a whole center and they have it set up like a circus
where you know the green glass goes in this clown's mouth and the tin cans go up to the alligator and so we don't recycle as much as we should but we do recycle newspapers
and cans and bottles
right
right
right i think that'd be a great idea we're gonna
right
i would like to see them i
yes you do you sure do in fact i put mine in my garage and i'm sick of them but
we take them my little girl she gets a collect the money you know since she has to haul them down there every day so i let her keep the money i was thinking the other day about
plastic gloves that the dentists and doctors and everybody has to wear now that'd be wonderful if they could recycle those you know as it is now they can't
well i think they're nonrecyclable
right
contaminated is what they are you know they but that you know plastic just doesn't disintegrate
and that that's major thing i mean how many pairs of gloves they go through in a day
right and i'm just thinking about the orthodontist where i take my child you know for his braces
yeah
yep
yep everybody yep well it's too bad that they have to but be nice if those somehow could be recycled
you know that'd be better for everybody
and then the baby diapers you know i don't have anybody in diapers any more but gosh i used my share of disposable diapers
yeah
well that's good
oh yep
yeah but that's
uh-huh yeah i used them with my last two uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah it gets really expensive yeah but see i think if people go back to cloth diapers that's better for recycling i mean that's better for the environment
sure well i see in the future i see people being more conscious of we're gonna be forced to recycle
you know i see even plastic shopping bags there's you can return those and our grocery bags our paper grocery bags has a five cent refund on them if you bring them back to the store do yours there
oh they do oh that's oh
yep
that's right
you bet oh yeah
okay
okay
um-hum
it's funny that those are my two my husband's two favorite shows too and i enjoy both watching both of them but i used to didn't like night court
and i and the only reason i think i like it now is because i've seen it so much now i'm involved with the characters but
i used to think
i find him degrading at times and i guess that is the point but sometimes it just
oh
um-hum
i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character i haven't watched
he's doing amazing things but he's doing them within the bounds of what of normal person would do and i think that's i like that
i think my favorite show is hunter and i like the old series better when
deedee was in there yes
and so and then the blonde that they took out the one that got killed
yeah i didn't enjoy her i she was too much of a opposite of deedee and i think that's what they try to do but i think we wanted to see deedee there or somebody like her
uh-huh
the second lady uh-huh yeah
they didn't yeah she would go her way and he would do his and i think that's what i didn't like
and
um-hum
right
and i like the new lady better but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there i'd just as soon have the police story without all the romance
yeah i think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now they're starting to go back to it and maybe that's what the public wants i don't know but i just
i like the cut and dry solve the mystery and that's what i always enjoyed about it
yeah
um-hum
yeah
just go ahead and quit the wondering and
yeah
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
yeah
i didn't
i was going to say i didn't ever watch moonlighting but i heard that's what killed it that interplay died when they got married and so the show died
um-hum
right
halfway through
yeah
yeah
um-hum
oh
yeah
i i'm guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotypes which a lot of shows
yeah which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which i don't enjoy because of that
but
i've seen it before but i don't watch it regularly usually tuesday nights i'm out so
um-hum
um-hum
yeah it's funny how we
we romanticize people like for instance when i was a teenager you know you romance
romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you don't care anymore or something like that and i think it's the same with your characters on tv
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
it would have been hard wouldn't it
i just the publicity in and of itself much less the i mean when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place so
yeah
yeah
yeah i think we've covered our time it's been good talking to you
oh you're the first man i've talked to everybody else has been a female so this is a change
well
well in my experience i've never i've been fortunate enough to be able to stay home with my children
but i have given day care to other children
and those that have come asking me to give you know to tend their children i guess it depends on the parent whether they're looking for a preschool type situation where they want the children to learn
you know different skills and school type things or whether they're the children are younger and they just want somebody to be there loving and nurturing
hm
would feel that four at the very earliest i think that children need to learn how to get along with one another and to play and to be creative and to
yeah
i agree yes i agree in fact a lot of the kindergarten teachers that i've spoken with said that they would prefer that preschools
per se would be done away with and that the children just had a chance to you know develop the social skills that they say the kids that come to school that have been to the preschool type settings
are almost far enough ahead that they're bored with school
and they need to learn to get along but have you ever had children in day care
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh
oh
uh-huh
oh
oh
yeah
huh-uh
oh
oh yes how many ooh that's been what probably twenty years ago
yes
um-hum
um-hum
i think it is in fact i know that around here one of the major problems that the working mothers have said they have is they will find a day care provider and then
she will stick with it for oh you know five six months and then have something else come up and so then they are looking again for another one
unless they go to the commercial day care providers and i know in the community i live in a lot of the mothers prefer just to have their children go to someone's home
and i know that that's
there's a risk with that with the insurance and different things like that but i know most of them prefer to have their children just in a mother and child home type environment
so i guess it just depends on what you're looking for and whether you mind if it was myself i would rather have my children in that type of environment rather than the big commercial day cares just simply for the fact that
there's so much illness that the little ones pass around and you know that type of a thing and the
and i don't know what the one to one or you know what the ratio is for the adult providers and the children but i would think that if you had a small group it would be
that would be my preference anyway so
oh
uh-huh
so what do you think about mandatory public service
uh-huh
right were you ever in the military or public service of any kind
oh really
what denomination
uh-huh
right
i think it's also a good idea
people that i've i was just thinking this morning about
how
are you there
okay hi i was just thinking this morning about how people tend to get off into a
to one narrow track and one narrow focus and don't get an opportunity to go out and look and experience other people and other ways of doing things
so in particular i was thinking about up in lately visiting around to a lot of different congregations and the preachers that i've heard that have just grown up and stayed into one particular denomination
are not nearly as good and expansive as the ones that have come from a different denomination to the one they're in now
so in terms of having life experience
and a better appreciation for other people and other points of view i think
the mandatory volunteer service is a great thing great idea the problem is
that as you say not everybody will have a great experience
the ones that are wanting to do it tend to have great experiences though some of our friends that joined the peace corps have been really lonely
right
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
you don't get any newspapers
i'm kind of the opposite you i get all my news from newspapers so we have we have two newspapers
yeah two newspapers in the morning and
i'm in a in a government position that i'm in the news a lot so i
i kind of look through to see what i'm quoted in
but
how bad the quotes are every day
yeah
or sometimes there's letters to the editor about me or there's a
even editorials
but tv the tv i don't really watch even if i'm even if i'm on it
but just
right
and that's
cnn had the
everybody was watching cnn that seemed to be the
place to be to
to find out what was going on that
at that point i was watching the tv
on something like that
well the thing is with tv i
a lot of times the news on the local tv is so brief you really don't get the full picture of what what's going on
and that's a problem that i have is not it's getting just a little brief idea of what's happening but
right but i like the weather report
of i go surfing down here and i always want to watch the weather for when the waves are gonna be good
yeah no right on south florida coast
where the weather is still warm here
yeah
yep weather channel's good
yeah
i mostly look for the storms out in the ocean
hundreds of miles out so i can predict my week and where i'm gonna be
so i can be at the at the beach when the waves start coming in
how much
um-hum
um-hum
yeah the in my mind the people that say that it's in violation of their privacy it's
it's actually a violation of the people they work with if
it's not fair to have people working around you that could cause accidents or harm to yourself
um-hum
is that mandatory for the recruiters
um-hum
um-hum
has your number come up
um-hum
sure
um-hum
hm
um-hum
hm
yes
you're kidding
huh
hm
um-hum
well what does it test for
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
hm
um-hum
hm
um-hum my company's small enough here that
in fact i don't know of any companies right around the twin falls area that's testing i'm sure they're here
but i certainly wouldn't be opposed is it hard for you to tell people that are on drugs i mean
and i don't know how you can confirm that or not but
i'd really be surprised if someone in my company was using drugs now it doesn't mean they're that they're not there
and maybe the testing wouldn't you know show that they were there
but
you can see that pretty easy can't you
right now i think my favorite ones are parenting and car and driver
right i'm a grandfather so basically i'm getting interested in raising kids again and i like all the articles that you know the letters to the editor and like the coupons that are in most of the magazines i get
and course car and driver i've got two teenage boys that are in the market for a car so we i've been trying to teach them how to read for what's a good deal and what's to get as far as insurance costs et cetera
yes they have they compare them i use the car and driver i knew we they mention other magazines and consumer reports is in our library so i don't subscribe to it because of the cost i try to keep most of my magazines down
but the consumer report is the magazine's the best way to go because the book comes out like once a year but the repair records are good to compare it
because i think right now with our budget range we're comparing like hyundais and older model datsuns and toyotas and fords
so what
yeah i just started getting those i guess somebody put my name in the hat or something because i got my first one this month and said if you'd like to continue please fill out this card
and i haven't even had a chance to look through it yet i just got it today
so that's your favorite one
so you're a home builder you're
do you rent a home
okay we rent but we still get to you know do repairs and do improvements and take some of that off the rent
you run the gambit of trying different ones every year i get those american family publisher advertisements and that's when i make a comparison
based on prices and stuff and then of course for home repair anything like that i wouldn't do that many projects anyway so if i do plan on building a door or fixing something i'd go to the library and start preparing for it before i did that
and of course on the magazines have no advantage on some of the home builder centers because they have pamphlets already made up
and you can be talking to a customer service representative while you are looking at the pamphlet where with the magazine any questions you have you write to the editor and you have to wait for the answer
yeah
no
well reader's digest used to be good on coupons and all of a sudden they just kind of cut back on it and
for the price anymore i don't think they're worth it
yeah i stopped doing that a long time ago
oh and i confess i've got one other magazine tv guide
every week i've got to have my tv guide
the newspaper just doesn't do it justice when i wanna read my favorite section in that is cheers and jeers
they're pretty good i sold them as a kid for fifteen cents each got four cents each more than i sold now they're up to eighty nine cents each which isn't too bad if you have them delivered to the home
well there certainly are times when it's necessary i believe to place someone in a nursing home
that person just becomes too expensive and too hard on the family
to care for somebody within their home
but i think everything possible should be done to
keep someone at home before that happens
oh my
oh thank goodness
does your mother have any help
no i think it's only when a person becomes
my father had to be placed eventually in a nursing home he had alzheimer's disease
yeah it's
and it was just impossible to care for him twenty four hours a day
but
and there weren't enough
resources i think in the community to help my mother care for him
which was really unfortunate
i think it the placement could have been delayed had there been
more resources in their community
oh it was
and
i think she was there every day
at noon and at night to make sure that he was
fed and cared for in
a proper way and
it was exhausting
he
it does make a difference if there are regular visits by family
that the staff
you know is aware that they can't be neglecting somebody if the family's there everyday
and i must say i have some sympathy for the
nursing home staff itself they
they are overworked
certainly
yes it's doesn't have
it's not compensated adequately and the
and there's certainly no prestige
attached to
you know it's sort of a yeah it's a sad situation
i think any nonprofit facility is probably better run than
those institutions that are strictly for profit so that means
often that they are church run
but
oh
yeah
actually i
my work is to advise families in finding care for their elders
and sometimes that means getting in all kinds of community resources to the home whether it's meals-on-wheels or home help aids or whatever
but when somebody is looking for care i recommend that they look for something that's
has more than one level
that it's not just an independent living
uh-huh
uh-huh because you couldn't take care of her anymore huh
yeah that's rough isn't it
uh-huh
wow
yeah that's really hard my grandma is
and she's still on her own
and she's down in phoenix and i don't know what we'll do when she can't take care of herself her son my dad is dead
well i'm like the yeah i'm my sister and i are the are her only grandkids
so i don't i don't know what's going to happen with her but she's amazingly strong
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
hm
uh-huh every night wow that's dedicated
oh i see
yeah it's a tough emotional issue
yep
yeah that's tough
uh-huh
uh-huh
i remember one time i was
a little younger than me and they were talking about the differences between i don't know whether they were from mexico or but they were you know definitely latin american
they were talking about the differences between how our country cares for old people and what it was like back home
yeah they weren't course they weren't talking about where you know you're absolutely unable to care for them but it was it you know they would come from large extended families
where you know the old people were at home
yeah i don't know i and i've been single so long i don't even know if i could handle living with a wife
yeah
uh-huh
well my grandma's in a retirement community now and
seems to like it there a lot and stays really active and
colorado springs
yeah
did you hit one
all right
the savings and loan scandal
kind of neither
i do have some republican leanings because i am division one you know
i think it's a stinking shame that
that there isn't capital punishment for those assholes that stole our money
i agree with you i think it had something to do with deregulation but i believe
more of it was just greed
well
you know we've watched and watched tv and seen that a lot of these people
were doing things not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit but financing the same property three and four times
you know and the list goes on and on
you know of just the crimes committed
much less for criminals that should be indicted
yeah
yeah it
everyone forgets whose money it was
and everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are
wanted
by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny american word
i
as far as being a republican or a democrat i think no american
could stand
for criminal action
well
in theory in theory a healthy economy
has a lot of spending going on
and
if people are making money
people can spend money
and it'll generate taxes
well the problem is and the problem with reaganomics is
that
the people at the top are the ones getting rich
and
for what they would cost and we weren't producing anything
we as americans weren't producing anything it was all inflation
and i'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it we agree too closely but
you can't say that was right
no intelligent person can say
that
we could spend our way rich
remember all we're doing
is delivering pizzas to each other
yeah well
it is a life and death struggle with the japanese
i i'm very tired of it all pays by the hour
and i'm nonexempt
is so
what
what does a nonexempt sound like
that's
well i
now maybe i'm not the typical nonexempt that you deal with
the badge is silver
and i am degreed though nonexempt
no i do not wish my time to come
oh no i
government tool control is my specialty now i did pc protection control work for
ten or twelve years right now i'm just trying to tool crib and hauling chips
times are bad
they turned all installation up here off
they told facilities they could not work
i don't care what the jobs are
you will not work
and as far as our you know
our conversation goes
i would really be interested to know
how much
of ti's problems now are related to
the banking structure
i
it really hurts me
to realize that
a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values
one of our
senior
no
our economy in colorado springs fell completely apart
right
yeah it's northwest seattle and also they do some of that in wichita kansas
huh
secorski boeing
well you realize
okay i think we're started now
do you wanna go ahead and start
well you like classical music
i like classical music i like rock and roll i like country and western
i like all kinds i like i like different things about each one of them
oh you don't like country
the kind of country i like is kind of the older country music not the not the kind like kenny rogers and stuff like that that's
that's a little bit to it it's like they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing you know what i mean
oh like hank williams like the old hank williams even hank williams junior is real good stuff the kind that
yeah sometimes i do i mean not all the time
yes and i
i do too i also like jazz
yeah you're about like i am then i can't watch mtv anymore i used to love mtv
you know and jeez who else is that van halen now i like i like groups like that but when you get
i even like guns and roses some of their stuff
some of them are just really rough so you went to school then in i'm surprised you didn't go to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff or
oh okay
oh i see are you married at all
oh okay
well how old are you
okay so you were out of you went to school for awhile then quit then went back
oh were they religious
ah i see i
see my parents were very musical my mother had a piano in the in the house
my father likes country western music
he's from west virginia so that's what he grew up listening to and he's always liked it and you know he's probably about fifty three years old now so he grew up like in the late fifties and
you know when they had that the elvis presley music and stuff like that and the and that kind of rock and roll so he likes that and my mom always liked that kind of stuff my mom likes like doris day
you know she always had those these old doris day records and stuff like that though so you know i grew up listening to that stuff but
i could see why you went you know i could see why you were kind of sheltered i guess from music
oh okay
oh okay
yeah so do i do you like van halen or anything like that or how about bryan adams
it this love cuts like a knife summer of 69
yeah he sings that he's from canada
titles and artists yeah
well do you watch music television mtv at all or vh1
oh okay yeah do you get cable
oh okay that's you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow
but yeah i like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos i like watching that kind of thing it's
no i haven't heard her
oh okay
oh really
so do you do any of your own repairs or maintenance work
yeah do you have like an american or foreign car
okay
because i know like i've got a honda and it's just beyond even my dad's and my husband's comprehension a lot of that stuff they grew up with americans
little simpler arrangements on under the hood so they'll change the oil for me and
that's about it these days
yeah it's
you have to have metric don't you
yeah
yeah
well it's a lot easier than getting under there and finding out something major
has happened that you didn't know about and advanced auto closed fifteen minutes ago and
getting into that kind of hassle
yeah i had i was having problems with the cruise control
so i had to take it down and have them look at that and they said it was something with the
the way the choke was adjusted
yeah
well i had the like the sixty thousand mile tune-up done at the same time
so the whole thing was like two hundred dollars
no it i mean the first time i found out how much it was going to be i about fell over
but
holy cow
wow
was it is it a fairly new car i mean was it
well that's still
i know i haven't the little bit i know about cars i've never heard of anybody having that happen to them
man
did they
yeah
well i've the only two cars i've had i had a honda civic
and it was let's see
i'm trying to think
how old it was i got it in
eighty one and got rid of it in eighty eight so it was seven years old and had almost a hundred thousand miles on it
yeah and i mean i never had any problem with it and i've got an accord now and other than you know minor tune-ups like with the choke and stuff i've never had any problem with it so i've been really lucky
mine's an eighty eight
yeah
no i've got the lx
okay
yeah
and this one's you said yours was just now about sixty five thousand and mine's an eighty eight and it's it just turned over seventy thousand
so
yeah
sure
yeah
once it
we've been looking recently just
you know mainly window shopping but we've been thinking more american just
because we want a bigger car this time
and we've been looking at
crown victoria and grand marquis and we're leaning a little bit towards
the
grand marquis as far as just looks but my parents have a continental and they've had nothing but nightmares with that car
it's been it's been one thing after another going wrong that the local dealer
either says there's nothing wrong it's your imagination or says well it's supposed to be that way just get used to it it's been an absolute nightmare for them
so it kind of makes me dread going back to an american manufacturer
yeah
sure
yeah
um-hum
i believe that
yeah
i wish there were bigger foreign cars really it seems like they kind of
really
yeah
i hadn't really even
yeah
yeah
moving them up
and i don't think people mind too much taking the car in for a tune-up
you know just general fifteen thousand mile maintenance or even getting the oil changed if they know that they're not going to have any other major problems that they'll have to pay for on top of that
what did they used to say ford stood for fix or repair daily
well that's great
i wonder why they can't extend the truck's
you know reliability out to the cars i mean i don't know
that's weird
really
man
that's great
i think they need to take a look at and see what they can't figure out what the catch is there
yeah and you know like i said i've had i've had great luck with the hondas and it's kind of hard to walk away from a good thing when it's you know you're not sure what you're going to get when you change
yeah
i had the tires changed at fifty two thousand they had they had started to look to look pretty bald
no let's see i had
okay
well i think they're having a lot of trouble right now i know my son goes to a private school but
i think they're big city public schools by definition are having a tough time right now just from probably from budget cuts and everything else going on
overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper school upper four grades about four hundred and something so it's maybe a hundred per grade
yeah it really is
ahead at an early age and i didn't feel like in what was available particularly in the first three grades
and even in the fourth grade when they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program
and i just didn't think that was gonna get it i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead everyday
but yet still be with his peers age wise
we wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school wouldn't have thought of it and you know and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe and
i guess i
well the world changes so i mean obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be i mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things they have a whole lot more
variety of things that they're that they see and do at an earlier age so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time but
but still i think it goes back to a commitment
by the parents to teach basic values and basic
and i just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore
yeah had to wear dresses didn't you
yeah i think that probably does have something to do with it that it's also
sure i'll offer anything that i can on the subject my husband and i just bought a just moved here recently and we bought this house about i don't know year and a half ago
what we have here now is just a basic three bedroom two bath brick house which is completely different from what i had before when i was working and before i married i lived in a little town
so it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up new plumbing new wiring
um-hum
it is it is yeah
that's true when i met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time and the town that i was living in only about eighty miles from here
so you know i we really it was just the market was so good we hadn't really planned on buying and as you probably heard from the in the dallas and texas area period
the housing market is just unreal i mean you can get things for such a song
so that's really why we ended up in a house like this his is not what we you know what we want to stay in forever because i have to have my i've found that after doing this other house i have to have my hands into stuff and
yeah that's the key you know the thing is when we moved in they had just
painted we're you know wallpapered new carpet and everything so i feel sort of you know like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because i'm in the mood to do it
so we'll see we'll see how much longer we're here
um-hum oh oklahoma of all places
yeah uh-huh right
oh yes uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
oh it is yeah
um-hum
i see uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
yes
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
that's where i need to go
exactly
yeah uh-huh
um-hum
work right uh-huh
um-hum
oh my word
oh no oh my word
for forty dollars oh my
um-hum
something uh-huh um-hum
right
oh how fun
oh how nice
um-hum
uh-huh right
right
um-hum
yeah but you did stagger back and say oh doesn't this look nice
well let me ask you when you laid those bricks i know my parents bought a house about ten years ago they're fixing to sell it again but and move again they're kind of my mom's like i am she's a renovator a lover of old things
and you know they have to be doing something constantly and the patio that came with that house
was not laid on a like i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something on top of the sand and then lay the bricks but they have they have a problem with these little like sand bugs or something
that drill in between all these bricks and of course you know you have the weeds that come up in between the bricks or and things like that
uh-huh
yeah
i see
oh okay yeah
um-hum
as tight as you can that's probably because they had you know every spring my mom says we're going to have a barbecue and tell everybody guess what we're going to we're going to redo the patio you know we're going to pull up all the bricks but they just they just haven't brought themselves to do it
so
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah
right
right well the thing that's funny is they've done they've done things like that you know i'll catch her out there spraying around and then it's like
in two days time they'll come home from work and those little things are back it's just they're the most resilient little characters
and so i don't know what they're finally going to do she may just hopefully they'll sell the house and go somewhere else and then she won't have to worry about it
right
yeah what it what it is that'll take care of them
yeah
right
oh that's true that's true but my dad farms and you know she's always telling him isn't there something that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray you know out in the out in the field that you can get rid of these bugs but
it might it might do it yeah she's got so many she's got just a gorgeous yard so many flowers and her four cats you know so she's sort of
real funny about what she sprays
um-hum yeah
i know i was just you know it just seems like i as i said when i heard the what the subject was i thought oh gosh i haven't thought about what i went through at that other house in so long i've been so busy
but i don't know of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do but gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house
up the stairway even you know i just had a ball with it was so much fun yeah and i've sworn up and down my mom's
my mom's great grandparents had this huge victorian house in paris texas
and the one thing that she ended up with is was the old door that was that was on the front door of that house
and she has that up in her attic and i have sworn that it i'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does so as far as looking toward the future
you know that's my plan i'm going to have to move fast i think though because you know as i
well care of the elderly is something that is hitting pretty close to home at me right now my father-in-law has
been diagnosed with terminal cancer
and my mother-in-law is in a wheel chair so this is something that i've been thinking quite a bit about lately
and
i'm i feel pretty strongly and the rest of my family does that is long as someone is able to care for
someone else
that they shouldn't be put in a home but there's a very hard question of what happens when someone isn't able to provide that care for themselves
in the case of my mother-in-law she's not able to bathe herself but she's sharp as a tack at this point and
what sort of facilities are available for that person it's hard because you think of a home and you're really thinking of
of old people left somewhere to you know fairly forgotten and that's
that's a hard thing and i'm sure not all of them are like that
yeah
so it's very hard to find a facility that would allow someone of fair degree of autonomy in their life
but yet would still be there to help provide some of the basic services
no she's not
she's still at home and her son has moved back into the house which was not as inconvenient as it sounds because
my father-in-law and my brother-in-law have a dental lab in the basement so he was working out of the house anyway
so it's a little less
it's not all that inconvenient for him
but
the rest of the kids are scattered throughout the northeast
and he doesn't want to feel that he's
he's going to be completely responsible for this only because he happens to live right there with my in-laws
that we've all thought about that fortunately that doesn't seem to be a big problem but
we there's some thought that has to be given to
to the property for instance they have about four three or four acres in connecticut
and what no one wants to see is that land having to be sold off simply to keep her in a in a nursing home what we'd like to do
various things and have someone there in case she falls or something
um-hum
um-hum
that's great
um-hum
right
that's great
um-hum
i'm hoping that the trend is toward places like that
as
the population in america
lives for a longer period of time
i guess thirty years ago when you were that age and you weren't able to really care for yourself
you really weren't going to you know be around that much longer and so the level of care required
was different but now people are living longer and can
can have injury
maybe we were a little unsure because we were looking at something broader
you know nationwide worldwide or something maybe we should look city wide
you know or school board wide or you know what i'm saying narrow the topic a little and see if we don't recognize some trends there
one thing that i definitely have noticed in our area as far as the school system at least
we're effectively counting but at least for a show we're involving more parents in input and
um-hum like i say this may all be in name only
kind of thing at this point but at least it's a step in the right direction i think
i have five school age children
um-hum yeah
well we
we try to keep abreast of it
of some of the things that are that are going on and
we've
we've just gone through some city elections here in plano for our city council
yes
uh-huh whitmire is she still the
um-hum
yes
um-hum
oh i definitely think it's a trend you know this morning on the way to school we just
just so happened that we saw a lot of buses and
i usually don't have all my children in the in the car at once but i'd taken them all to the chiropractor this morning one big fell swoop and then we were going on to school but just a tad late long enough for the buses to be going back and
the kids said gosh look how many of these bus drivers are women and i said you know that really is a good indication of some of the jobs that have been
you know that trend that has swung you know one profession that you know there are a lot of women now and i think it's good because
those women sometimes pick up on those kids emotional needs and
might you know be aware of those things coming or going from school where maybe the men don't always you know they're just there to drive the bus you know the women are more
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i definitely think that administratively in the schools women are
are a show of force now that we did not see even
five years ago
certainly not you know ten years ago up to that point they were allowed to be teachers secretaries nurses
so forth even your heads of
you know like your food services that kind of thing
your deans you know they weren't women
you know that's
yes
uh-huh more and more
on
oh that's excellent you know that they're getting a chance
the type of
uh-huh
well and that comes once again you know is that you can teach in elementary school you can even substitute in elementary school in the state of texas without a
yes you can substitute teach without a certificate or a degree
and then you know work on that and if you want to work on up but you still can make good money you know
part-time money as a substitute whereas you know to teach on college level you have to have a phd almost always sometimes you can get by on a fellowship program or something where you might be teaching but
uh-huh here in plano they pay about fifty dollars a day
that's good part-time money for but it's not career money
you know but it
you know for a part-time situation
and once you've gotten your foot in the door for several years substituting and then take on a degree
you know you're pretty well assured of a of a job in the system eventually
that you know that you've been subbing in a lot of times you know i think that's
i think one thing that
that we're seeing you know a trend in politics is
that our cities are taking a lot more responsibility for citizens becoming involved in the environment
recycling clean up programs refurbishing you know historical and
park land
your city you know where they adopt a highway kinds of things those are becoming more and more
government originated
and not just private enterprise
you know generated
to make people do it probably
which you know i thought texas would be the last place to ever
get people to do those things voluntarily and i think their don't mess with texas campaign has been very effective because texans don't like to be told what to do they're very proud of their state
so they've
psychologically they've done a number on us there
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
well my mother was always real picky about that kind of thing i think i'd probably have my fingers cut off if i'd ever thrown out a candy wrapper or anything but
uh-huh
um-hum that
yes
i agree for it to and to be adopted and funded
you know by cities and you think the incredible amount of
you know money that we vote for our cities to spend on these kinds of things so
you know it's definitely you know you have to consider that a political trend because we're the ones voting for those people
you know to that are in favor of those kinds of programs and make them you know campaign issues
so
uh-huh well of course dallas is in a great upheaval right now over the fourteen one and ten four one
you know programs and it's you know going back and forth between courts to you know
no i'm not
and i think a great number of students who got word of it and participators in general and voice who heard about the program
i rely primarily on
on newspaper combined with television
okay
that's rather interesting
i'd have to say i haven't either
i listen to the radio probably five or six hours a week but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical station here that based on research primal for music purposes
we don't use the radio as a wake up we have our a television connected to a
electronic alarm system that kicks in and it comes on with cnn in the morning so we wake up to television news and
shower and dress and whatever to that and then because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together in a car
we chat at each other rather than something else
and occasionally what we'll each do depending on who's driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in the car so
newsweek magazine we tend to alternate between newsweek and time and whatever happens to be the news magazine of the year for us and i read
sporadically of commentary and a couple of other
you know trade magazines and such as that where i might read
the there there're occasional social and even current event commentaries and everything as diverse as acm to some of the other tabloids i get so
i guess i use eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent television i
i think i respect the from a journalistic perspective current events i've always said that it it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline
i'm not sure what you would call them they the small competing independent sort of newspapers little small weekly things but there's only one daily it's called the news and observer fondly referred to here by some as the
sometimes the noise and observer it depends it it's it has decent national coverage but has an extremely
focused political coverage probably steeped in the southern history and the fact that this is a democratic state and consequently everything is filtered through that republican democratic sort of
glass almost unnecessarily so
yeah we have that is as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section and we pay it sort of glancing nod we have a very good friend who is
tapped into the city planning structure a developer architect friend and
right so i think we find out what's happening in the city on a fairly frequent basis over a over a gin and tonic sort of thing and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of raleigh than the paper would have anyway
um-hum
um-hum
is that right i heard that there was some stuff on the on the radio that was equivalent to cnn
okay
okay
oh that didn't
um-hum
we probably were listening to cnn fairly heavily before the war broadcast began
we almost lived and breathed it for because during the war itself to the point where we began to
sort of have household pact of let's turn the war off and get something done
almost an addiction and we could equate or relate well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in unhooking uncoupling from the events
and going on with their lives instead of being watching the missiles and being glued to the to the tube and whatever
and because of that we began towards the middle end of the war i guess about two and a half three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would
watch fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news
we would watch cnn until six thirty then we would watch a rotating network news of either abc cbs or nbc and we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one
and we would watch the first fifteen minutes and then turn the television off and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourself on news that way and then we would do a similar thing
at ten forty five because cnn would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage
and then i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would have better state coverage rather than local coverage three of the networks here on their local news that
unless it's there's some trend or something that says gee this neighborhood has been hit forty seven times or whatever that's sort of more of a of a pattern news
yeah i've got three cats yeah me and my roommate have a little business on the side and we breed cats yeah it's
well just about anything we get our hands on right now we've got a bombay a turkish van and a himalayan persian
and yeah they're a lot of fun and we're not in it as a business we just we like cats and we decided well if we're going to have them we might as well get some purebreds and maybe make a little money on the side
yeah
yeah a friend of mine had a dachshund and it's same way i mean
one of mine does the himalayan persian the little himmy
if i take her to the vet i used to put her in her in a cage and take her down but now i just carry her out to the car and she crawls up in my up on my shoulder
and just watches everything yeah she enjoys the car
probably i think it's the carrier that scares them now on the other hand the bombay hates the car she'll
um-hum
will she crawl up in your lap yeah some of them some of them are like that they yeah they don't want to be held but whenever they want to sit in your lap they want you to be open to that yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah most mine generally stay in the windows they're
yeah along the one side of our house there's nothing but trees and bushes and we've got lots of squirrels and birds and all that around here and they just they'll sit there in that window for hours watching all this
yeah and they'll go to the doors and stand up on the screen door looking out but they're not too interested in going outside i
yeah the bombay actually went through one of the screens last week trying to get out so i had to go round her up
but
yeah they're fun
um-hum
sounds like my next door neighbor
oh that's my problem i'll go down to the spca or the humane shelter and i feel so sorry for them and i just want to i want to bring them all home
it's so pathetic to see them down there
i'm just it irritates me the way people
mistreat animals and they don't do it intentionally they just they're just doing it they go out and they think oh wouldn't it be cute to get a kitty
and they go out and they don't have it fixed or anything and it has kittens and they can't support it and they take them down there and they end up getting
or move off and leave them and they end i don't know where this my next door neighbor had a had a dead cat next to his front porch yeah i'd seen the cat around here before i thought it belonged to somebody but i have no idea what killed it
it might have been might have gotten hold of something bad or we had a cold snap here not too long ago it may have frozen out there i sort of doubt it cats know how to take care of themselves
yeah well this one was definitely outdoor cat because i saw him all the time and i suspect somebody had just had him and moved off
it's sad i mean and they do it to dogs
the last dog i got i think was that way because he was he was in fairly good shape but apparently just didn't have a home or couldn't find his way home and i don't believe it because he was one smart dog strange mixture he was
the best i can figure he was part lab because he had a lab head
and definitely part bloodhound because he had these big old jowls had the bloodhound mouth but he had the soft bite of a lab
and he was the smartest dog i've ever seen he just i could talk to him and he knew what i was saying
um-hum
well my brother my brother raises labs and he gave one to he gave one to me several years ago
and she was she was just the sweetest little thing but they love to chew and so after she had chewed up my redwood furniture
yeah oh i ended up getting her a six foot two by four and let and she had the best time with it
yeah
yeah well they're enjoyable to have around i run a little business out of the house here and i'm usually alone
and got all these cats around so they keep me occupied well they
well of course and dachshunds like chocolate i remember that other one too he was always after somebody's chocolate bar
my cats don't think much of chocolate course they're so damn finicky anyway
it's
yeah well they do well we found out that didn't work because we even bought the expensive stuff and they looked at it like you've got to be kidding like you know what are you a fool paying that much money for this
i've got one that won't doesn't even like anything with fish in it
yeah actually you know fish is not their natural food that's the
i don't know why i guess the cartoons and everything people grow up believing cats like fish the only reason they go after fish in a fishbowl is because it's moving it's something to play with
i bet it likes chicken though
yeah every one of yeah even mine love chicken when i get in when i yeah when i get in there to fry chicken or something they're all standing around waiting because they know they're going to get a piece
i usually yeah okay well it's been fun you have a good day
yeah thanks a lot bye-bye
yeah north carolina state
yeah i didn't know that we were going to be talking to mostly ti folks i thought it was all scattered out among graduate schools or something yeah
yeah
yeah one of one of our professors went down to a seminar you guys had sometime last year and got the information and brought it back and
that's right
sure
yeah you yeah you could just sit there and talk
yeah
yeah
yeah like hal yeah
no i'm a i'm a student here yeah i think we should adopt it i think we're a little bit backward as far as the rest of the world's concerned
oh yeah
uh-huh what bothers the heck out of me is one of these so-called american made cars where part of it's put together in japan and what you've got is you've got standard and metric
you know you go in there with a wrench and you know oh golly it's not a metric it's a standard
uh-huh
yeah you're right you're right because mine goes from seventeen to nineteen yeah
uh-huh
yeah a friend of mine's got a colt and i was doing something to it and golly half of it was standard and half of it was metric it was the most irritating thing
yeah i don't either i can't convert them i'm hope
yeah
they don't you think so i've never i've never seen one i've never seen one
no as a matter of fact i don't think is there a sixteen
i don't think there's a sixteen either
yeah i would too i mean we we're just about the last holdout in the world to hold on to this old archaic system i mean even england's gone metric
yeah
because for so long people are going are going to be able to equate miles to kilometers i mean when you drive around europe you do the same thing
yeah most of them do they have the yeah they have the kilometer inside and the and of course the miles per hour great big so you can see it
yeah i it's silly i don't i don't think that we ought to be any different it causes a lot of problems a lot of times between different countries in their manufacturing stuff and
well you know even interstate signs and stuff you can reprint the number of kilometers on the on that reflective stick on tape stuff that they use to
stick on those things and they can all that's all they have to do i mean that wouldn't cost a great deal of money and
i just don't see any problems with it i think it's just obstinate americanism
uh-huh
that's right
that's right
exactly right i mean i mean
you know now there's a big difference between a yard and a meter when you're talking about fabric
no i mean look at all the all the food containers are labeled with both systems i mean that that's no problem
yeah well
yeah i just i just chock it up to this obstinate americanism because
they sit there and they just don't want to learn a new system you know it's just like they won't learn foreign languages they go some you know they expect everybody to speak english yeah
yeah
sure
sure
sure i mean you look around at all these other countries i mean i mean you look at japan not only do they learn the metric system they also learn the our system you know and they also take three languages
i mean yeah i mean it's no wonder that we're getting beat out on everything in the world because those people those other people out there are working
yeah i mean look who's taking the engineering jobs and the and the math jobs and the science jobs you know they're all orientals
what am i taking master's in public administration
right yeah
i don't hold out much hope for anything coming out of this master's i i'm taking it more or less just because i'm interested in it but i'm also taking a paralegal course and i really want to
do that more than anything else i went to law school for a year and a half
and decided well i don't really want to be a lawyer i mean i knew that going in i just wanted a law degree because it would open all kinds of doors but
it's just too much work for a degree you're going to hang on the wall and never use so i said well maybe i ought to save some money here
so i got out of that and got back into the master's and then decided well paralegal is really the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i really like yeah
sure
yeah i mean
um-hum
um-hum
right even if it's in the home i think this is important even if it's a private home situation
and not a day care
probably number one too would be close references
if you know people that have had the experience at they hands on experience of one
would be very important
word of mouth
friends
um-hum
um-hum
as well as your word of mouth if you were putting them in school or any day care type you know that's public
you know what i mean like a church or a school type thing
i would check that awfully close
i'd go in often
unexpectedly
unexpectedly wherever they where
um-hum
um-hum
i wouldn't do that i mean i wouldn't not put my child in there though would you
you know i would never have a controlled situation not with a little one especially
you know that's not a not a good situation on that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum right that's real important i believe so too to meet the and administrators as well and really kind of
research it and get an idea of how they feel about things you know have your questions ready on their feelings on things and all
kind of how they basically anyway because they you know that's
seventy percent your child's life
you know is developing is there
so that's real important do you have any children in it yourself
yeah it's a scary thing my daughter's been in houston and had to do it you know just out of the cold she's had to
but she's been real fortunately in finding women in their homes
and
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh wow yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
not the best situation yeah that's for sure
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yes right and what you would want done right yeah
um-hum
i would think so
yeah
um-hum
the cleanliness and the care health care
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
okay now we're supposed to talk about music why did you check music
uh-huh
uh-huh what kind of music do you enjoy
like what kind of oldies
like the fifties oldies or older oldies
uh-huh
uh-huh they have the same kind of station down here and when i listen to music most of the time that's what i listen to uh-huh
uh-huh we just got a disk the other day that was a disk of nat king cole's greatest hits and it is excellent it it's about twenty of his greatest hits on it it's really an excellent
excellent cd we are we were really quite pleased with it
okay
well
really
at the same time or
uh-huh like so you're in the marching band and stuff in high school yeah i played the baritone horn in high school band and in college so and my wife played flute in high school
so
well i like it i like the low instruments better too
do you go to do you go to listen to much live music
do you listen to much live music like concerts or things there
we're going to one here in a couple of weeks the
i don't know if you follow broadway much but michael crawford was in phantom of the opera on broadway you know you know whom i'm talking about
and he's coming to dallas on the twenty ninth and we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of andrew lloyd webber's music so that'll be good
my sons are kind of into broadway they my older son is at columbia in new york city and he's been to see phantom and les miserables and bunch of other things up there so
and he does it he can go if they get sixteen dollar tickets to that thing yeah and one of the last time they went up a friend of his wanted to go and chris didn't want to go so the friend david went and
he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets and they gave him the seat that normally belongs to john bell john it's his house seat that's under his control and he said it was a great seat
so he he's been to they've been to see it several times
yeah
yeah
would they do don't any of those ever come to pittsburgh
sure
well we're kind of you know they well i saw two road shows of les and they were both excellent
so if it comes to pittsburgh in the road shows and i think they have three different companies that tour the us you should go see it because it's really it's really outstanding
really
well i think it's just incredible i and then you know those two guys who wrote les wrote a new show call miss saigon
yeah it just opened in new york this spring and my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it and they got tickets for the opening night
and they went to it and they said it was it was great it was great
yeah like depressed mode and
yeah i don't know too much but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff
so he listens to new wave and you listen to the oldies
that's kind of different well that's good though you know it's good to cover all the bases there
uh-huh
well we don't now we don't listen to much country but we just at the same night we bought that nat king cole album we bought garth brooks' album no fences
that is excellent
we well we i've never listened i mean i've probably heard him but i've never bought any of his music
garth brooks is probably the only country album we have or no wait my wife bought an album of hank williams' greatest hits
nope this is hank williams senior so these are a bunch of old recordings
she bought that the same night we bought the nat king cole and the garth brooks
it is pretty good she likes it it's a it's a little it's a little too country for me it's little
little too
honky-tonk or something for me but
i like i like the garth brooks album a lot
it's pretty good it's pretty good
uh-huh
which album which of his albums do you think is the best
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i think we'll probably get one of his albums because we do kind of like it but you know it's kind of different
so it's good
yeah we do like the juds in fact we have a juds album
okay well do you have any formal programs in your area
yeah
yeah what i don't know we there are some beginnings of formal programs where we are though they're not in our town i mean jackie and i recycle cans you know we just we just
fill up a we have a trash can set aside for aluminium cans and when it gets full we just take it down and drop it off at the recycling center but that's about the extent of ours
i don't it seems to me like if they really wanted to get serious or you know the government and the other private industries that could benefit from it would make perhaps more permanent
exterior fixtures which you know wouldn't be hassle to drive to or carry stuff to you know that that's kind of one of the thoughts that i had about it
um-hum
yeah
yeah they've switched to that paperboard the pressboard stuff
is that right
yeah
isn't that something
yeah
oh
they are yeah they're like i said we've just recently i guess in our part we're like right in the middle of the state and you know we're not more in some of the metropolitan areas like dallas or houston or something but that you are starting to see more
big large recycling like dumpsters where
uh-huh
well you know they've got these adopt a highway programs they have to give the convicts something to do you know
yeah
yeah
well there's already oil there isn't there
um-hum
yeah
huh
yeah i well i think we've already seen that i mean just in the this the few products that have plugged that is a is an advantage you know it costs more and people have jumped on them
yeah right and then as soon as something comes along that is that you need and all of a sudden it's available and in a environmentally
i tend to agree and it sure would be nice to see something like that
yeah that's right i sure enjoyed it
okay
and barbecue right
let's see we ate at louisiana purchase up in plano just recently we had a craving for catfish and they have some good catfish there
and we enjoy there's an italian restaurant over in garland also called taste of italy i don't know if you've tried any of those there's about four of them around town
but it's good home style italian cooking it's not the fancy veal and things that you get at some of the other italian restaurants
they make excellent spaghetti sauce and little garlic rolls and things like that
and i also recently we had jacolya out at addison cajun cooking
north dallas and richardson and plano area we live out near richardson square mall
so it generally in that north side of town
yes there's an excellent i guess it's tai it's one of the southeast asian type restaurants down in deep elm west wind or
yeah
yes i believe so i am really not sure exactly what style it is but it's very good
now right in the edge of north dallas there at skillman just north of lbj there's another vietnamese type restaurant called yoli's y o l i s
which serves some excellent food too in that in that style of food
oh that's hard to say but the ones that we like most are out of business now but
right but papillon is one we go back to quite frequently for continental style cooking
oh
right um-hum
i think you would enjoy it it's a tad on the expensive side probably run with dinner and some drinks about twenty five thirty dollars a person
it helps quite a bit right yes we have used some of the coupons also at some of the places but
that is i think one of our favorite our most favorite restaurant was lalouve which was here on in north just off of central expressway in north dallas but that's been gone several years now
it's gone right it's
well we we've enjoyed it the there've been some excellent restaurants here through the years and of course some go up some go down and it just depends on the chef in some cases of course
no i haven't been to that one
yeah
yeah well again the old sonny bryan's up there by what is it by methodist hospital
up on inwood yeah that one is not it's a it's a barbecue stand really it's not really a restaurant
that's right they make some really good barbecue there
but i used to work over on just off of stemmons and we'd go over there about once a week for barbecue for lunch
but
there's oh there's
you're right yeah
but for seafood just all around good eating seafood vincent's has some really good seafood
yeah
well there's several there's one in plano one on midway there's one over by love field i think
there are three or four of them here in town and we've gone to the one over on midway and also to the one up in plano matter of fact let's see we were there new year's eve at the one on plano
yeah i think you'd really enjoy it
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
we had dinner there we have a group of friends we go out once a month with and we had dinner at ralph and kacoos last fall i think
and we were there and it was excellent the night that we were there
i think we have i certainly enjoyed talking with you
you'll have to try it don't expect anything fancy
it's home style food it's not expensive and get the dinner salad with the olives on it
so
yes my wife swears by the lasagna
yeah they have excellent lasagna and if you get like spaghetti with get with the italian sausage it taste like home made italian sausage you'd get in chicago
yeah
thank you bye-bye
well i'm not painting of the artist
variety what i like to do is i like to paint the inside of a house
paint cabinets or paint furniture
but i'm not doing much of that right now haven't for quite some time
how about you
just
old fashioned brush and roller yes yeah when
yes a very messy way too we haven't done much painting
interior or exterior in the last two years two and a half years we bought a mobile home and with the natural oak
or natural wood paneling on the inside we don't have that painting to
to contend with but my husband has painted some of our storage buildings and
when he put the
skirting around the mobile home then it had to be
sealed painted
yes it is probably the summers are harder actually than the winters are because it the sun you know bakes and dries them out and we don't have an a lot of freezing weather like you would in idaho
usually not more often than about every oh three to five years depending on the type of finish that you use and too the type of wood that you're putting it on
oh that is the only thing that i know of we
were fortunate in that the last
painting work that my husband did was
on new finish so it didn't have to be
prepped anyway
we had painted or had paint i had a house painted that we owned over in greenville and we had it brushed and scraped
and a primer coat brushed on and then the in fact i think there was two coats of primer and then three coats of the
paint that went on that it was an old frame house but it lasted very well it must have been on there nearly ten years before it needed painting again
yeah that sounds familiar too my husband hates to see me get the painting bug because he says i'm i make a terrible mess and i guess i do but
in the times that he has helped me taping the one of those plastic drop cloths to the baseboard
and then setting chairs or something against it to keep the
keep it from getting kicked loose
is about the best way to keep it
you know from
speckling all around
how did you get involved in the
this
project that we're doing on the
voice recording
uh-huh
well now i have a question for you do you like fresh water fishing or salt water fishing
is that right
oh you do okay
oh where do you fish for striper there
okay
oh
um-hum
uh-huh pretty much
okay so you're out in a boat then
oh
i've gone up there camping like at eisenhower state park and i've observed fishing but i've never actually fished there
yeah
so you like to go for striper then
well the time i went and watched i went over to the to the dam and it was right after
one of the major rains that we'd had in fact i think it had been over the spillway recently when we went it was back down but some of the roadblocks were still up or there was evidence of them
and people were they really had the gates open
big time
well i couldn't believe some of the striper that these people were pulling out and there were just people galore for that matter just everywhere just huge fish
all right
deep in the channel huh
i'll be
oh wow
right
and so i i've been spoiled by that but i had a string of seven or eight years in a row
of sort of a close knit group we would just hop in the car and drive straight through two thousand miles
and we started out fishing out of a lodge and then we started either taking our own canoes or renting them
when we got there and hitting a few of the
you know smaller lakes along the river chain and catch northern pike and walleye primarily
and sometimes lake trout also
so we'd always go the first week in june you know essentially as soon as school was out and everything is all over and done we'd we go
course one year i went two weeks too early with a friend that was he at this point he'd graduated from college and was in the army and
he had a two week period he had to work with before he got shipped off to germany
we could go on the streams they were open up you know the where the water was flowing but the lakes themselves were still iced over for the whole yeah whole first week we were there
but then the next week they were just like day and night difference we had some rain and wind and it cleared all the lakes off and you know the fishing was already really picking up but
those were my favorite fishing trips the most serious fishing i guess i've done
oh
good grief
yeah
wow
right
that's incredible
boy
oh boy
yeah
well i need to break my kids in they i have a son you know wesley that enjoys it but he hasn't really caught enough fish to appreciate any fishing so i i'd like to break them in a little bit
uh-oh
yeah
uh-huh
right
huh
what do they use for bait
yeah
good grief
yeah use the little ones for bait yeah why not
oh me
fourth of july yeah
oh me
i haven't really done any of that and oddly enough jackie's parents live on the beach in north carolina and we've i guess we went out one time
and just fished you know from the shore like in the winter you know one christmas trip
but other than that that's really been it yeah they i've always wanted to actually go out in the boat i think i went out on a snapper party boat in the gulf once upon a time but and i was i was too sick to
to enjoy that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
where do you work
oh
uh-huh
right do they do it like you know within hours of
the accident or is it
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
huh
yeah
yeah i think that's probably true too that's sort of scary
yeah
yeah that's a bad situation i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that i think they should
i'm a ti employee and i'm really gung ho for it in fact
i you know some of the places now like ibm don't allow even smoking you know in the in the plant we have designated smoking areas
but i work in sort of a building that's not really it well it's on the campus of the ti facility but it's a little bit you know separated we lease the building and it's a factory environment
and they have designated smoking but it's just wide open it's not ventilated properly and i think that's bad but as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way
i think it's a it's a definite i think it's essential
yeah
in fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years and
but uh-huh
which i thought was interesting
oh man yeah
ooh
yeah
uh-huh
what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind
wow
really
well it's really lucky that you got away from that cause that's
really
downward spiral
yeah that's it
yeah
just life in general
yeah well i'm well i'm definitely for it
plus you know you want to think that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share
but that are not endangering your life in some cases like my husband several years back worked for motorola
and they had you know i mean it was a chemical handling type
yeah i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals
you know that's really that's really frightening so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know
on a on a greater frequency than maybe just you know the paper pushers like i am
well you well you'd think so but
i don't know if they do it -til yet
because when he was at course now it's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the designated smoking type stuff you know at ti i forgot what i guess it was like eighty four
eighty five something like that and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever
so that's scary
oh
ooh
that's awful
uh-huh yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah peer group is the other way now instead of
uh-huh that's
yeah that it really is
okay well i enjoyed talking to you cathy bye-bye
all set do you want to start
sure go ahead
oh god
do they have many buildings that have security there
yeah
yeah well i went to dallas when i worked for ti in abilene and i'm a little familiar with the city area forest lane and you know through that off the freeway
and it didn't seem like it was that congested in that part you know because to me where we live out here in the north east it it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
and the cities are very populated with tenement housing
where there are more than one family in a house
it really does and i've seen the same thing that you're talking about much more crime than ever before drugs of course a big part of it i think
and i don't know a lot of younger people you know into more violent crimes
that that's really sad you know you got young boys or girls that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever
yeah
it is and i don't know if it's the family you know thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and
the kids aren't getting the attention that they need or the television
and i really think that we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people
i
yeah
yeah
exactly
and you know they had in fact on the news last night we were watching this man who lost his ten year old daughter
he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone now ten years old she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know
and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store that's what it was
and someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her
and the whole bit and one of the men got i think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for life imprisonment
the one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven and he's out
and the man said that you know if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself and then go to mcdonald's and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it
and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands
and that innocent people i shouldn't say innocent because i mean actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances but
the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it's like two different things
sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things
i don't know
i like the idea
that if someone is from a foreign country
and they come to this country
and commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported
especially if they're found guilty of the crime
you know once they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty that's it we don't take care of them we don't support them
nothing i mean they go right back where they came from
exactly
and
but that's they're so close i don't consider mexican people in the same category with especially like people who come from cultures that don't have the same kind of moral upbringing that we have
like you take asian countries or the eastern countries
where women are like in the foreground in the background and the men are in the foreground and it's like you know they live back in where we came from two hundred years ago you know we've advanced beyond that
and i think that their mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing you know what i mean
it's
uh-huh
yeah
wow
wow
oh sure
that's amazing well what's the difference there do you know
oh i believe in the death penalty i really do
yeah i think that we're too easy and we take the civil liberties stuff too far
you know like people that are in prison i mean we didn't put them there they put themselves in that situation and as far as like them entertaining the rights that they should have
i mean we educate them we feed them we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again
i'm not saying they're all bad but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for the rest of their lives
i think that they should be put away
get rid of them
exactly i really i think that that's the whole key here this plea bargaining baloney
where you know they plead to a lesser crime or they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they get less time
or if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior they for every year they're in they get so many less
you know that they don't serve the full penalty
i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this
yeah
same with drunk drivers
i think it's too easy for them
that if the laws and were harsher and were enforced
i mean you have to set an example you have to start somewhere
and i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again
an i feel bad for the policeman because he's out there every day facing these people
this craziness you know people with automatic weapons and all this other stuff and trying to do a job and let's face it what do they get paid
twenty thousand dollars a year if they're lucky i wouldn't do it for that
it is it really is and i mean they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything
you know and i'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything but they they're already have three strikes against them when they're out there
because they'll arrest someone and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them you know what they say
well i own a company
i'm the president and ceo of the company
so i guess i determine what the benefits are
i'd say in today's economy besides basic benefits such as health insurance and life insurance and the some type of retirement plan
i'd say that most of the employees
that we have really like a profit sharing plan
they like to participate in the profits of the company like they're like you know because they feel like well we're contributing to it so we'd like to participate in it
and so that means i make a little bit less but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in it working
right
i think most people don't want money it's been my experience most people want to feel like they're participating in something that
that is not a drudgery you know that they enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of
right
yeah well our people get a lot of satisfaction we're a financial planning firm
yes so you said you retired i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning but anyway
we do we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to
and it's real important that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that where they were that
that it take care of them they don't none of them really want to be rich but they like to have enough to be comfortable
well we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a salary
is tie
a percentage
of business that a person would participate and bring into the company
pay them based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary and the
no not necessarily it can be in house people who help you handle x amount of dollars
right well see we have we have marketing people and then we have financial planners
and then we have staff secretaries and administrative assistants
and these secretaries and administrative assistants you know if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company they can get very dissatisfied very quickly
and so we're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle so
administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business
and
well and but to see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to
or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with
it encourages them not to complain
when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it
see we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it i don't think any i think most people want to be
lack a better terminology they want to be self employed but they don't want to take the risk in other words they like to control their own future but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please
without some real strict adherence which that's what we have
oh okay what building do you work in
oh okay
oh okay
i've only made a few
okay our topic for today is invasion of privacy so i got a good one
when the phone rings and you've got a recording and this always happens like around five or six o'clock at night it rings and you get this recording and then it won't go away and any of the type of solicitation that where they call all the time you know
there are evenings especially friday nights thursday and friday nights well we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night more people call that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall you know your sitting down to eat and the phone rings and it's like
um-hum
um-hum oh yeah
yeah
that's real irritating to me
uh-huh
they can leave their whole spiel on it
yeah that a
and it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things
will just
make up numbers at random and just call them
and so it really
really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not
you know you have a unlisted number or not and they pass around cards that have everybody's name on it like if you order something through a mail order catalog
you know then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in and a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list or they sell their catalog list of people to different companies
and everything
right
uh-huh
um-hum
oh yeah oh yeah
let's see i'm trying to think oh have you heard that i'm trying to think of what company it was there was a company that was going to
be giving out information
about your financial status
well i work in the computer science center and so we hear a lot about things that are that computers are capable of doing
and this was a software program
that a company was developing that was going to have x amount of million peoples financial history and information on it
and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera et cetera
and they finally stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused because it was such a big deal and i wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either i mean there was a lot of stuff going on about it
okay
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum well that's real interesting i know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need on several things and
you know your credit and all they ever need you to do is give them permission to pull a credit thing on yourself and there it is that's all they really care about they just want that credit history to see if you're a liable person
if you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that
oh i know that there's several people i've talked to that really have a problem with it and i'm former military so you get kind of used to going through stuff like that you know you don't pay any attention to it i mean once you sign over your soul to uncle sam might as you know you just kind of
kind of blow it off but so
so i think i think the people who've been down that route or have had it to deal with anything like that have learned you know
it's just one of those things you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about you know but i do know that there are several sites i didn't i wasn't aware that austin was one of them but i think johnson city was one
yeah there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue
and the but also on things that i'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that
there were people
there were the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too
um-hum
um-hum
oh i don't think it's a
um-hum
or
well i think it's a safety factor too because you know when people are inebriated whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever they are very unsafe for the their coworkers you know it's like
i mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that you can understand but the blatant use of drugs or anything like that
will be a problem
so okay so what is the subject now
is eleven and i've got two sons that are
six and three
and between the four
my two girls play a lot of soccer and we travel a lot with them
and they're either practicing or playing and it is really tough to fit everything in
uh-huh
oh is that right
uh-huh
oh
it sure makes a big difference doesn't it
yeah
yeah
it sure is
we have in fact this past christmas
we went out to california both my girls were involved in tournaments out there so went out there we spent christmas with my wife's family out there in california and then
we drove out to or down to southern california and had the tournament we went to disneyland as a family and just kind of you know spent time together that way
yeah
you bet my wife just said to tell you that your grandson is beautiful
to be blessed
yeah i know that means a you'd mean a lot to brian he's a he's a heck of a nice guy i really enjoy being friends with him he's
when did he find time to learn how to do brakes he just helped me do my brakes
yeah he is
yes
uh-huh
i have i have some time i own my own business out here so i have some time just spent with them you know whenever the time whenever they need me but
well they'll come back on and tell us when the time is up yeah it they should be another couple of minutes so
uh-huh oh yeah
well i think that's it that's probably more important than anything else
not taking advantage of our you know of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us you know i mean we could direct the government even more than we have been i don't think we've been doing too bad
well i think that as a whole that the being that the drug problem the drug industry can bring so much money to a country i think that if it wasn't for the united states government matching that the
the drug cartels or whatever would control most the central and latin america
just that money is power and
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right exactly yeah
but
yeah
well sometimes that's america doing that too you know we
that and that and yeah the america starts talking then about removing bases and whatnot and stuff like that and people
right
yeah i think that has a lot of things to did with
yeah that was it i'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not because
on one hand you have you know that the you know the soviet government of course mistreating a lot of the slovak countries and then on the other hand you have
i don't know really what's going to happen
oh yeah i think we're getting quite a
put it this way i think no i think the people are revolting themselves and we're
allowing it to happen
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah i think central america has always been one of those places where people are more passive
you know where it's always the minority that are
are trying to make the country better
i thought it was the other way around they were always you know having to meet in the catacombs and all this so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it it's been sort of like you know
i don't quite understand that
do i understand what's being said
oh yeah the old church
yeah
very close to spanish
yeah
yeah
i never really thought of in that way
i mean you can say that about africa too i think it has something to do with the poverty level because africa is certainly not a catholic country and yet
and you know they have the same problem where you know where kings and such
well in south africa yeah
racial i think
or like you say maybe communication of knowing that hey up in other english colonies or previous english colonies everything is equal and yet down there it's not you know
i think communication does have a lot to do with it
you know in education maybe i don't know about education because the black community is still not very educated down there so
so i think it is communication it's just oopsy
uh-huh
yeah that's true you know that i don't know whether actually i i've always wondered whether how the education system works in the russian countries the republics you know
really that's good
and i've been sort of disappointed how that they say literacy rate has gone down you know
that's sort of upsetting
in our country yeah
that is really upsetting and considering it's free you know
i mean good education is really still free
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah um-hum
um-hum
yeah um-hum
i would say our dinners are probably more casual than that with having kids and that kind of stuff it may be inviting you know neighbors over for dinner or something like that but not really we haven't really tried a dinner party i guess
yeah or a barbecue or something like that yeah
um-hum
right yeah
yeah
yeah
that's true yeah
well i guess we lived in kansas city for awhile and it was kind of fun to do mexican food up there because a lot of people didn't really
the recipe i've used is you marinate it in a can of beer and a bottle of italian dressing and then you can either uh-huh
and then you can either grill it or you can
broil it we usually grill it outside and then you cut it into real small real thin pieces and serve it on flour tortillas with like grated cheese and sour cream and guacamole and that type of thing
um-hum
it it's kind of a thin steak
and so it doesn't take very long to grill
yeah
yeah um-hum
well you just well i usually just put it like in a pyrex pan you know i have an eight by or a nine by thirteen pan i put it in there and i pour it over the top and then you just you know turn it leave it in there for overnight or something and turn it every once in awhile
um-hum
oh yeah
the whole yeah
yeah
and some people like sour cream and then you like warm your flour tortillas up in the oven
i usually just wrap them up in foil or something like that and stick them in the oven for awhile
in fact as a wedding gift we got a tortilla warmer but i don't think very many people have those and it doesn't hold very many tortillas so we don't use that often
probably yeah
because once you get the meat in there it gets pretty filling
um-hum
oh well good well it's nice talking to you where do you live in indiana i have some relatives that live up near terre haute oh okay
yeah well i know when we flew up there we flew into indianapolis and then had to drive down there so yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
okay
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum but that's what i do i always i vote in the national elections
and i vote pretty much i i've been pretty good about voting in most of for like the for mayor and for governor and things like that and try to try to
you know go through and figure out because most of the people you don't a lot of them you don't have any knowledge of and just go in and just arbitrarily voting all republican or all democrat i try to i try to find out a little bit about them
but i understand why i know one problem is
why people don't register to vote i know some personally because in the past and i think that's been changed that
that's how they get the jury rolls from voter registration but i think that's going to be changed
so i don't know if with that changing if you know if the voting will pick up but i think it's just like you say when you're if you're if you don't have an interest in something and you don't really care you may not go and vote
but
but what is it what was the percentage for national elections
less than half
that surprises me too
hm
no i haven't
uh-hum um-hum
so the campaign that you worked when he was running for governor and that and he was elected that time
yeah it's i would imagine it would be pretty i have a friend of mine whose her son-in-law is a judge and i've gone to a few things with her
and it's just like a different world getting involved with those kinds with those with those people in politics so it is very interesting
um-hum
so
what so do you think there's any what could be done to improve the
percent of voters
right
um-hum
i don't know well i know for you know my son who is of voting age and
he didn't want to he did he said he couldn't afford to be off from work because they did not pay them for being off from work and that's why he didn't register but
i wonder if that was really you know the real reason and then i know my daughter well she's twenty now but i got her a voter registration and gave it to her
and i really don't think she ever turned it in but you know
i just don't think it's important to some people and maybe thing you know circumstances may change and
but to get them interested in doing it i don't know
unless a lot of the people who are eligible to vote have no transportation and
you know not able to get there or for whatever reason so i don't know
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
maybe we'll get this question again and can
get some thoughts in the meantime if i had some you know think about it ahead of time
nice talking to you charles bye
okay
i do and i really love it
uh-huh i do it for a hobby
and i have my own equipment and i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and
in the process of getting a router
and so i like to cut out my wood and then tole paint on the items that i cut out
what kind of things do you like to do with wood
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
oh
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yes
oh that is fun
um-hum
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh the twine
yeah those are so cute
they are really cute
and i just got back from that today so if you could get your projects into boutiques oh they are wonderful
you could make a lot of money from those
apparently with that boutique they take oh what was it
twenty percent of the sell price you would put your sell price
and then they would take twenty percent off of that
at the counter and so and then at the end of the boutique which usually runs for a week
so you have to decide what your price is going to be and then
so if the customers are willing to pay it then you get a profit
they are i have seen those are darling
um-hum
oh
oh
oh
um-hum
oh yeah
oh
oh uh-huh
oh
how fun
yes
um-hum
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
well how is the market for things like that in california
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
hum-um
they just snap it right up huh
oh
um-hum
oh
well we've test driven the oldsmobile delta eighty eight and a cutlass supreme and a used cadillac about three or four years old
because
i get married in a couple of weeks and i have two kids and my fiancee has two kids so we need we need a car that's big enough for six
and so we went i guess it was two weekends ago we went car shopping and looked around
that
in addition to getting a new car there they can get you a car that's new but it's been a demonstrator model
for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you
for a new car
so they call this program cars and they come with a new car warranty
and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that
uh-huh
okay
yeah
uh-huh
sure
oh yeah
yeah i think so too
well the ones that we were test driving were the were the new ones there um-hum well now
now they may be the demonstrator models but that the sales reps drive around in
yeah it was in eighty eight the guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes he says it'll probably be gone in a day and it's probably gone by now
those things go fast
of course we're not we can't consider getting a brand new cadillac because those are twenty five to thirty thousand dollars but when they're three years old they're the price already drops in half
so then it becomes more realistic
uh-huh
yeah
that's right that's right
well you can reduce that risk by having the car checked out i mean you know if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this but if you've narrowed it down to one or two
you can have the car checked at an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it
and then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting
oh i'm thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars
no huh-uh
i would i would think so
isn't that a good feeling
that's right
well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it
yeah
oh yeah
um-hum
yeah i would think that's true
sure
right that's fine
that's right that's right
well
yeah
that's right that's right
eventually
yeah the first two cars i ever bought well i've bought three cars and i've always bought them new the first car i kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty one thousand out of it
the second car i ever bought i drive to work now that just turned ten years old and i've got a hundred and twenty two thousand miles on that
so that that's kind of been the way i've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever
but
my car is using two quarts of oil a week now
about a quart every hundred miles
so but i mean it runs fine all you have it's just very thirsty if i just keep the oil in it seems to be okay but you know that's a sign that i'm going to have to do something sooner or later
it's a buick century
no my fiance is selling a nineteen seventy eight cutlass supreme that she has it's actually in better condition than my car
and so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low
yeah you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in
oh really
oh there you go
well that's fact
i think you're right
interesting
um-hum
oh okay
that's right yeah
right
yeah that's good
uh-huh
right
yeah
is that right
my gosh
and you laughed all the way to the bank
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's right
yeah
such a deal
i'll bet you did
well dana it's been really interesting and i appreciate talking with you
thank you much bye
that was in japan i didn't get to see that we've just gotten back yesterday from vacation
and so i was bumping up and down the highway in a camper and i didn't get to watch any television so i've just been finding out about this once i got back
yeah
well i think the key issue that's going on at the moment is the current economy
and i think there's a lot of things that need to be done to rectify that situation i'm not sure that the government is the key player
i think one of the statements that was made a year ago by gorbachev
when he was announcing some of the problems that existed in the soviet union he made the comment he said well our country may be bankrupt but referring to the united states he says your schools are bankrupt
and that's been a big concern for me
and i noticed that when i go into the tougher courses at some of the universities like organic chemistry or something like that
that you don't find very many white american males taking the tough courses
you find you find a lot of asian students you find a lot of females in the class
and in all of the tough courses that i have taken the only blacks that i've found in the class have generally been from nigeria or some other african country they're foreign students
and it's i think it's kind of pathetic that
our kids are not motivated to
to study in depth and to take the hard courses and i'm concerned that is our economic problem not how much money is being spent at christmas time
um-hum
yeah well i know when i went through school i went through an engineering school and of all my close friends they were all there because they loved engineering
they loved building things they loved solving problems they liked
you know being creative and there was another group of students there that were there to be engineers because they heard that engineers made a lot of money
and we didn't mix very well you know there was a total difference in attitude and we felt very
um-hum
yeah
well that was a terribly precarious economy i've been kind of watching it over the years and observing that the amount of bureaucracy over there
what's new
well
quite a variety of ways i guess like to listen to the radio back and forth to work at least to work and in the mornings
well i have one station i listen to when i get up in the house then i listen to another one in the car
yeah
hum
well we don't have well let's see i guess it might be available i just haven't heard of it on that one i guess i have come to think of it but
i haven't made a practice of listening to that one
watching some tv in the evenings
well i usually catch the networks and i will occasionally watch cnn too depends on what you know
yeah
i generally i don't know i go to the nbc sometimes
abc sometimes
yeah i watch that
yeah
yeah
yeah that's what i was just about to say about the newspaper i take it then i quit it
gets there laying around and don't get to read it's does get to be quite a volume of
material after awhile
yep
yeah same here
our morning paper throws you a curve they you know that's what i would like to do i say well i'd just like to take the sunday paper well
so
what do you what do you do
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
i've gotten into some
you know we have a
news service on our
network here on the computer
well we have that at lunch in the cafeteria but we also have one that you pull up on your screen you know we have a computer network here at ti that you can go to
dallas and get the national
they have a dow jones segment there where it covers us you know some most active stocks general average
yeah that's actual that djns i guess
well credit cards i think they are wonderful but
i think you have to have a lot of restraint
i have never been in trouble with credit cards but my youngest daughter is and a friend of mine is and i think it is terrible
that they can you know wipe out a max in such a short time
i never pay interest charges i value my money too much to line somebody else's pockets with my money
and i always pay it off before i am charged any interest on my balance
never
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
before you have to make that payment back to the credit card company without being charged any interest
that's correct yeah you
um-hum
your budget has to be so that you can
you know summarize what your balance is going to be at a particular time and i can do that
that's right
well that's what the you know that's what that's what it is geared for advertisement you know is to wet you appetite and give you that
oh i've got to have that i can't live without that and that's the image
that the younger generation has you know
um-hum
on that
who was that could
is that a department store
oh okay that's probably
no it is not in dallas huh-uh no we have dillard's and sanger harris and macy's and
neiman marcus and things like that and i am sure that they probably would not have a problem either
well
yeah self-control though is the key
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh dear
um-hum
wow
sure
well experience is the best teacher and sometimes you know a lot of us have to learn by experience and if you can learn by someone's else's past mistakes then you are very wise
if you can heed to advice given
that's true yes i am yeah um-hum
um-hum
sure
oh credit cards are you know really a blessing
but you have to be wise when you use them
and i have nothing against them other than you know people abusing it and then they get themselves in hot water and
you know they're just hurting theirselves
and when you have a bankruptcy it takes you i think about eight years to wipe that off your record
and so you know that is the shame about that is and people won't touch you
and you've got to live that down
so you have to be very cautious about how you use your credit i mean it is a wonderful thing but don't abuse it
oh absolutely sure
um-hum
sure
that's right
well there is a lot of people that know exactly what they are doing
and they will run into thousands and thousands of dollars into debt
and they will deliberately do this so that they can go into bankruptcy
and they have a way of diverting all of the things that they've bought and put it like in hiding
no i've heard there was a radio program in dallas that we listen to and i well it in fact it's nationwide
and i was shocked at some of the stories that came out of that program about
these people that really you know they bought all these wonderful things
and then they went bankrupt
and they knew that yes they knew that they were going to do that and they just um-hum
and they said you know it was worth the jeopardizing their credit for that amount of time
because they still had the stuff you know and they could write it off
you know they can only be responsible for a certain percent and not the full amount that they owed
and i don't know who
determines the percentage rate that they have to repay but it is not surely
what they are were indebted for
um-hum
so it they use it as a scam
instead of
to me they were criminals and they used that
in a in a really bad situation
and that has kind of snowballed i guess around so i do not know maybe the courts and lawyers are
working on that to you know cover all the loopholes that might exist
but i've never been in that situation and hope i never have to be
okay
no i can't think of anything i am sure that we haven't covered everything because that is that is a great big a ball
credit
i can't think of anything right now
bye-bye
that sounded like one
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
excuse me just a minute i'm on the other line karen
yeah well the results i hear what you're
you're saying about the results
and it's
what to do about it i guess is the big thing i'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my wife teaches school here in plano
and i know that the results that they get out of the system sometime is certainly not
um-hum
yeah i've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the home environment
no matter what they do in the in the classroom if they go home at night and you know it's all totally undone
the thing that karen my wife has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed
no matter what no matter how bad their teachers are no matter what a lousy system they're in or anything else these people somehow manage to
you know push on through and are successful
it's unfortunately probably what maybe twenty five or thirty percent of them do that
well that would be that'd be at the absolute most and
you know those that you know come out you know fall out of the system that are
are real trouble i wonder whether that's just a
a part of the system you know if you know in a democracy where you know people have kind of a freedom to sort of do what they want you know there's an inefficiency there
and you've got to let those you know those
um-hum
oh
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
and sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive you know you from the minute that you walk in until you
until you leave you're competing against somebody else or you're competing against a system or something you know and then
a lot of there is a personality type i believe that is really non competitive they're cooperative rather than competitive
and when they get into a real competitive system they just say oh well what the heck and
tend not to
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
i would think so yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah it right survival becomes more of a priority than education and unfortunately you know there's and old joke about
you know education's wasted on the youth anyway you don't you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway i know when i went to school
my attitude was kind of one of you know these people are you know taking a tremendous amount of my time you know and i've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again
i guess today that would be somehow or rather there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing but
the some of the cures that i've heard for this that sort of make sense
most teachers after they've taught for a very long especially at the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately
and it's kind of these intervention programs now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism and that's communism and that's you know and then it gets political
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well you know the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable there are kids families that should just simply be taken out of the homes
you know and
you know just removed from those situations or they're never going to get anywhere but yet politically that is not a very popular
view i'm sure that if you know ran on a platform of you know we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home and all yeah you know how far you're going to get with that
but unfortunately it's something like that in lieu of that you know is the intervention programs in school where the these kids are spotted
fairly early on and you know there's
all that but you know you can counsel a kid eight hours a day and then he goes home and
and you know in the in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or
or something like that or they don't care you know mamma guess what i did in school today well who cares you know
true
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah i'm
i don't know if you've ever had too much to do with
oh especially asian japanese families coming here in plano we've got quite a few
engineering types people who have come from japan and they put their kids in the us schools and they're appalled
you know not so much at what the schools are teaching but what they let the kids get away with you know they see most
they're quite upset about the disruptive
influence of school most of them would say you know those people should be removed from the school system and in japan they would be you know
but here again you get back into a political thing where
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah were you at baylor
yeah you go to baylor
oh okay i'm
yeah
um-hum well that's it you don't have you don't have the view
i graduated from texas tech more than two years ago i guarantee and you know i kind of look back at it sometimes well that was a lot of fun but you know i'm not sure that
that i took the greatest advantage of you know what i went through there
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
oh right
right i guess he had some culture shock and all the changes that took place while he was in space
um-hum
yeah i don't think
um-hum
well i think something like that may be in the works in the future trying to get some joint ventures between the two countries in terms of space exploration
yeah i think you know the they have a lot of resources over there
well i don't know i think it's kind of hard to determine
the truth i mean you listen to some sides of the story and they don't they want to cut funding because they feel that the rewards of exploring space are very limited and then there's others who say we can learn a great deal
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
yeah definitely at this point it is i have a friend who works for mcdonald douglas in california and there's a prime contractor on the on that space station
and i know recently i their funding was at least guaranteed for another year
so they're going to continue
but i've also read a lot of bad things about it how they're talking about the value of the space station is very limited in the amount of information that can be gathered is minimal but
right
um-hum
yeah
well
unmanned type space exploration sending satellites and or unmanned vehicles into orbit
or to other planets like voyager and that sort of thing that seems to be pretty valuable and maybe more cost effective than trying to put human beings into space
right
yeah and in a lot of ways it's improving the technology in terms of
signal processing and data transmission and trying to determine a picture from the information the very weak information they're getting back from these signals
and
um-hum
the biggest problem well like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools
that you know you can throw money at it but it's i don't know to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know because i mean the general values that we're teaching
kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school i mean
well the values more or less at home and the tv just a general i mean learning is not a revered endeavor really i mean it's a lot more
it's socially well i won't say socially unacceptable but whereas like in
a person that study they put a lot more emphasis on athletics and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society and i think that carries over to school a lot so
yeah
yeah you know i wonder if that's a root problem or not because i think about that a lot and it's just like everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now but i wonder
you know do you get the oh that's kind of side tracked but i just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how catholic schools are doing so much better
i thought well you know of course they're doing better and not so much when i was growing up catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools but
they still had a better success rate simply because they started with a lot better raw material i mean everybody that went to a catholic school had
at least the parents did at least had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it and i wonder if not so much that
yeah
yeah this is interesting because i in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a catholic school being a suburban kind of environment but this was actually inner city
people were sending i mean just because their kids had the ability and the and the drive to do try and get an education
they didn't send him to a public school you know you have like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance
yeah
yeah i wondering what do you what would you do to fix the school systems
yeah
yeah
yeah that's what i was going to say it's the chicken and the egg thing i wonder a lot of times
you know people i mean a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools you know vandalism wise and you go to
i mean it's been a while since i been in high school they're even in grade school when they do that but i can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that but you got to think in a way it's
kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything and take it out on the school
yeah
at currently i think they are a little restrictive particularly for certain ethnic groups or from certain countries
i think we should permit more immigration from eastern europe for example
particularly the jewish people from russia i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last several years
and i think we have
too much restriction on the on the orientals also
um-hum
um-hum
well we seem to favor certain countries particularly south american countries and
there is no i have nothing of course against the south americans or
or hispanics in that sense but i think we are more restrictive of the so called eastern european countries than we
we should be of course that's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern europe so
and
spent years and years lobbying for their release and their ability to immigrate from russia as soon as that occurred we
simply said that instead of the hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by two thirds so
no
and i still think you know again kind of having within this century come from a
an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so
um-hum
uh-huh
well i think in a way though i also have an opposite point of view which is
although i believe we should permit you know constant immigration into this country
i think we should primarily for economic reasons i think we should have
some quotas of course my family and i again that was you know my grandparents came over during the time when there were quotas so they had to wait
you know in certain parts of europe for years before they were permitted to come over
i think unrestricted immigration i think is not
is not best
um-hum well you know there's another aspect of this too they're also
diminishing the health restrictions which
well yes there are were some
regulations over i don't know whether they're laws passed or whatever they're called just recently where
people with certain diseases cannot be excluded from immigration aids is one for example and recently
tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country they dropped that also
so i think in some ways we are becoming a little too egalitarian in that in that sense but
i think we should be a little more circumspect about it
think we've talked long enough
or i have talked long enough
thank you
good-bye
oh i guess it's a general motors product and i like
general motors because they're made in the united states and we've had general motors for years and have always had real good luck with them
um-hum
oh i don't know i guess the seville probably or yeah
yeah they have been
uh-huh
oh yeah right
yeah
and course the top now the what is it a vinyl top i think those are pretty
uh-huh
oh i didn't know that
yeah and i suppose they all have the balloons
the air bags yeah
well
yeah
yeah i do i go for things you know built in the united states rather than foreign countries help our economy and
mostly oldsmobiles
yeah oh yeah that's what i have now but of course if i had my choice i'd still have the cadillac but i've been very satisfied with the with the oldsmobiles we've driven them for about probably twenty years
no the ninety eight
um-hum yeah
so
well no now the one we have has a six uh-huh but it's a very good car it's
a have not had one minute's problem with it and i've had and i have twenty three thousand miles on it
yeah
right
um-hum there that's true
um-hum
no it really isn't because now you can get like five year financing on them and so but i would go with the general motors any time
oh really oh
yeah well sure
right uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well yeah those are good products also
doesn't seem like
uh-huh
uh-huh
how much was the alternator
did he did he hook up the wire wiring wrong
uh-huh
uh-huh they probably built that in so they could make money
well i had a weird there's a little sensing device in front of my
i'm not sure right in front of the fan it's a it's an air conditioner sensing device i don't know why
it actually there's a metal piece that fits through the belts
and somehow that broke off
and i still can't figure out how it broke and
anyway so a this piece obviously i have a subaru and
i think you can only get it through subaru dealer etcetera so
and i haven't had too many problems with my car i got a eighty eight subaru gl xt and it
and then you know just basic maintenance and oil changes an i and i do not do my oil changes and i will not do my oil changes i've
i think the first time i tried to do one
ended up
trying to you borrowed somebody else's jack and i did this and i went and bought everything so after buying the filter and all the oil you're looking at ten bucks at least or somewhere in there an
and then to go to the trouble
that i figured
so that that's
how did you put that many miles on it in
four or five years
oh a hundred and forty mile trip
oh thirty five miles each way yeah
yeah
uh-huh do you work for ti
okay
i was going to ask you know as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now
i don't work for ti and i'm just i get these green
i don't know what you want to call them fake
point things
and i just wondering how i go about
oh okay
okay
okay
all right well that's good to know i haven't been doing this is the first time i've been called in a long time and i haven't been doing it so
and i've done it maybe twelve times
uh-huh
huh
oh well
i was driving a sixty six plymouth fury
yeah
yep and
and
but i had to
you know you know i
after about couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car so
yeah
well you know these
cars made in the sixties and stuff i mean the steel i mean the thickness i mean it those thing they're just
you just don't see cars like that and they last a long time and they were simple too the engines were simple and durable and
some people will still buy them you know they'll
some that she had to
yeah because it was a cadillac
yeah
the i'm replacing two or three starters on the chrysler
they
yeah and the
um-hum
they kept saying that the that's what chryslers did is they wore out starters you know
yeah
right
um-hum
yeah
right
um-hum
no
and it's pretty maintenance free you know and beginning the year last year
and drove a chevrolet cavalier station wagon and it didn't give me any trouble at all
yeah
it's a eighty seven
um-hum yeah
is it
rides or runs
it yeah well yeah it rides rough it runs good you know i kind of it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine
you have to kind of wait for it especially when you get on the highway
yeah
you driven american cars all
um-hum
not much gas mileage though
oh wow
yeah
now do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
well i
have a long experience with cars i when i was younger my brother had a corvette and i bought a corvette and
when you have a corvette you more or less do all the work and i've done everything from build the motor from the you know the bare block on up
and i i'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car i hate to go pay somebody good money
and so i
i pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything i can do myself but i've gotten to the point in my life you know i just crept over forty years old where
i don't know whether i've just reached a point you know it's real rough in the winter time
and then spring time i usually end up giving them a tune-up and make sure that they're running well and
yeah it's like i had the muffler go out on my on my car shortly before it was required to go in maryland they have emission tests
but the thing was that i could do the job myself i mean the parts cost me
oh roughly a hundred dollars if i'd taken it someplace to have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty five
yeah
yeah i don't mind it there was a time when i had my corvette i mean of course i loved it
but i've you know i've got other interests now and there's a lot other more important things i think i should be doing with my time
so but i think the difference is that when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing
and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right and
you know i've in the past i've had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and
and looked at it some months later i'd find something drastically wrong with it
you know like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident you know those kind of things and when you have a vehicle that's being used by you know other members of your family you know you don't want
that kind of a situation to come up
and it's very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust i only have one guy that i know that i trust to work on my car and he's about sixty miles from here
and so it and if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or feel i don't have the time to handle i'll take it to him to do it
uh-huh yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah that's probably
something that
would not have anything to do with them and later on and like when he you know grew up got out of the house and got his own car
he didn't know how to do anything to it i mean absolutely nothing i mean he couldn't even check the oil i mean that's how uninformed he was and disinterested
and i guess there are some people out there like that you know i always thought maybe you know if he took more of an interest and you know what i was doing and maybe we could have communicated better
but yeah i think that's great
i trained my wife in the in doing things in fact when i first transferred down to texas instruments back in nineteen eighty seven
and it was an interesting experience for her i mean she'd always assisted me and done some other things but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was it was something a little different
yeah
yeah i think it's important that everyone know you know basically how the darn engine works it helps you figure out what's wrong with it you know i've been out with my sister before when
you know her car died on the highway and i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all
yes
well let's see what kind of hobbies do i have i guess i it's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing i enjoy playing basketball and basically all kinds of sports and excuse me
oh yeah
uh-huh
what kind of time frame is it looking for the different shifts up there
is it basically i had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to mckinney is it texas
oh wow
uh-huh
wow how about that yeah that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to mckinney
how about that well that's unfortunate is there many other are you in the defense
is it many other corporations in the area
that i hear they're hiring all over the place for that
oh really
now is that actually just to colorado or to colorado springs
how about that
um-hum
right yeah that's why i was in the dseg down here in plano also
am i still employed by ti no i took a leave of ti back in november
actually december was my first month away from them
exempt
it fortunately i guess for myself it wasn't it was purely by my own choice
it wasn't there was no incentive for myself to leave but it was just an opportunity arose and decided to take it
no i should have taken the you know option when that was there but it was just i missed it by a couple months
but you know what can one do i'm just happy to still to have a job
yeah i am kind of happy with it it's getting better all the time i knew it would be different from the very beginning but you know as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system so i was in the computer operations
it's you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out
um-hum
right
um-hum well the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the fact that is more in the support of the manufacturing and there's lots and lots of companies that have
maybe not in the defense area but manufacturing in general
uh-huh well that's great that's good
uh-huh
sure yeah sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table
it may be a blessing in disguise
i know a number of people who are surplused and they're just actually what the positions that they've found outside of the company were much better than the ones that they currently had inside
exactly
uh-huh well i'm sure it's just with the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide on a pass
uh-huh well would you like to be there
uh-huh
sure
oh that's a beautiful place
uh-huh
that's just fantastic down there take it more as a this is your opportunity to do whatever you want pick out where you want to live and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do
um-hum
sure
um-hum yeah that's a it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it
uh-huh
uh-huh well the best thing about it is that you can try something if you don't like it shoot move on to something else that's the way i've looked at the whole thing here i'll take a chance if i don't like it i'll go someplace else do something different
five years
yeah
yeah i can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes
um-hum
well that's good you've got a good attitude about it
um-hum
right there you go
that's the way to do it
there you go that's the thing to do
that'll work out just fine
all right nice talking to you good-bye
well i work out at scarborough fair down waxahachie and i'd camp out there during the open season that we're open down there so i've got my tent and my all that stuff going and
tent sleeping bag and i just leave it all down there over the weekend or during the week while i'm gone and come back and crawl in and everything's
right where i left it i don't have to set it up once a week or anything like that but it's a lot easier
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's what's nice about working out at scarborough and the participants have a separate shower thing that we all are go use and everything so don't have to bother with port-a-pots or anything like that
yeah
i keep a one of those banana lounge chairs have the two parts that fold on it
so some people like to use the coleman cook stoves and stuff no real fire real fire got to have a fire pit
because i want i want my food to taste like i just cooked it over a you know a fire pit not over
yeah
what's wrong with the good old coffee pot throw the grounds in heat the water up
okay thank you
yeah how many times have you called or participated
okay i i'm a little less than that i was
going to call this week i forgot about it just until i was going to do it tonight i have i was i called i think every day last week and i forgot about this week i just got so tied up with some other things
i got about ten i think
voting
oh yeah i'm sure
i would think they would talk about people who are already registered and you know the ones that are on the rolls already you know
yeah
yeah
yeah i i'm kind of with you in fact i even think that the there's a i wouldn't call it a conspiracy but
you know if you really wanted you know hundred and hundred million people to vote why would you have voting from seven o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night for a national election
to me you need to have two what's wrong with having two days
thursday friday or three two and a days thursday friday and saturday or something you know where people can vote
a heavy vote out because
i can agree in local elections which usually are on saturdays and i'm not too sure that's the best idea i think maybe you should have it
you know friday noon till saturday so that people who i like do things during the week
and i might do it and i really think that they don't try you know i really think it's obvious the answers to me is just to have longer you know have at least two days for a national election my goodness
right
right
well yeah the seven o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night is usually the average time that most workers go to work you know
and i'm amazed by that the only good thing they've done lately is have these
elections
what do they call it when you can vote ahead of time
absentee
and i've done that and actually we've got some high turn outs here in arlington on some of the absentee because you can vote like two saturdays before or something like that
but i think it's amazing that they keep complaining about people not voting and
and national elections should be more than one day i mean i don't see how you can have tens of or hundreds of thousands of people that you know just can't quite make it on that particular day for one reason or another you know
two days to me doesn't seem to be too unrealistic for a national election
right
yeah the bonds we had some here in arlington recently but
yeah
i don't really know why you have
you know in a small city or whatever medium size city you have a couple hundred thousand people eligible you know and you get ten thousand to vote i don't have an answer for that i think that
it is apathy without question we are we are not taking it as serious as
the people who have lost their rights and everything overseas and everything and i think i don't know how to change that
i always try to vote for those and but i and there are some that if when they have them on saturday i'll say all right i'm going to work i'm going to go vote this afternoon
and then i'll get busy and if no one reminds me then i will forget so i'm not too sure course i guess that's part of being apathy too but i do try to vote in every one but
i don't i don't have an answer for the local elections and why you have ten percent of the people voting that's really so low i'm amazed
oh that too that too yeah
yeah
but i think in national elections again it should be the time is definitely against the people i think you ought to have two days you're voting for president
why is it so sacred to have it on tuesday
and why couldn't it be friday and saturday i don't know what the ideal day is if you're trying to catch a weekend or maybe just tuesday and wednesday i'll bet you'd get a lot more people i think the news media has really they jump in there
and they tell you the that who won before seven thirty and before the before the polls are closed
and i think they jump in way too early i think that ought to be restricted somehow
they will not restrict it but they just ought to not release i don't know i don't know what districts are releasing the numbers to these newsmen that they can predict
i thought the polls had to be closed before you were allowed why would you release it to the newsmen first i don't even know how the news media get these numbers
from the polls i would think that ought to be sacred and until it's all over
that primary
yeah i don't
yeah
well i think you can say you are an independent too but i don't know
yeah i haven't thought about that much i i've
wondered about it but i haven't really got concerned about it one way or another you know
what that holds back or anything
but you're right it that is a funny rule
at least
men and women can vote it's amazing that we can still look overseas and see
you know this thing in saudi arabia and all and they still don't allow women to vote it is still amazing of course we don't have such a wonderful history that
you know we didn't allow blacks to vote and we didn't allow women to vote until i don't even know what the year was for women
nineteen nine or something like that when was that
so but we're changing at least at least we're trying and maybe this absentee thing will take a hold and get more people to vote
um-hum
yeah i don't know why
well i think it ultimately i could see why you wouldn't register necessarily when you're eighteen or nineteen because you don't get around to it but i think that people should register you know after a year or so i don't it's not really that hard
i haven't thought that people don't vote because they're not registered i really think
of course that apathy too you don't bother to register
i am amazed i don't have an answer for why the numbers are so low
right or if it's close you know you like to see them close you don't like to see someone just totally run away with it and in a football game or anything even if you're for one team or the other you always like to see let's have a good game which means you want to see a close game you know
so if there's no controversy if you're not worried about who's going to win if you see you think it's going to be a shoo-in then you know you don't vote so
but at least i guess we're so far ahead of some of the other countries
that we've still got a better system and we are we have been doing this for two hundred years so
i guess it's still better that a lot of others
yeah it is surprising how
even with low numbers
yeah
well i here in arlington we had this baseball thing and it was a big controversy and everyone was talking about it yet the voting was so low it was unbelievable and they were spending a lot of money
you would have thought we would have had close to half of the people in the city voting for this
that was going to raise your taxes and it was like twenty five thousand or something like that you know
so that part of it is still there's something that people for some reason they don't really want to vote
and maybe absent maybe you ought to be able to do it on your telephone you know i mean i don't know
yeah
and it may come to that you know with the electronic age
you put in your code
yes
um-hum
oh
you know
well i have a bunch of computer journals because i'm in computer science but beyond that lately i've been reading i've always liked the new yorker
and lately i've been picking up some of the travel both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines
trying to keep up on what's going on
and my wife also gets a lot of the food magazines bon appetite and food and wine and gourmet
yeah and she still likes to get time
which i've never liked very much but she seems to
do you read a newspaper
yeah
some of them i used to get for the advertising like byte magazine which is
one of the larger computer ones
i haven't bought it now for about eight years but when i used to get it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising
because that was interesting i think a lot of the trade magazines are like that
that half the fun is finding out what all the products are
but you know some of the get ridiculous travel and leisure all of the american express magazines
so travel and leisure food and wine and i think they have some others certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and
um-hum
have you ever read or subscribe to consumer reports for any length of time
but not worth it
i i've always had this one of the reasons i like to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective so
i've always had this problem with consumer reports that in the areas that i know a lot about i disagree with them
and i always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything
or what's going on
so i've like i've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent organization magazines and
it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective
you know their major interest is in commissions and
you know there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines their major talk is about you know commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a the full ten percent or whatever it is and
yeah
some of them the general travel magazines do i don't tend to read it for that
because i don't expect to be traveling overseas in the future for quite awhile but i usually just read through the sections on domestic stuff
no
yeah i don't take in much more in myself
okay
okay nice talking to you
well we have the usual automotive pollution that and although it's not very visible you don't worry about that too much but
we have a lot of wood smoke
here now i heat with wood so ah and i'm one of the polluters if you think that wood smoke is a is a source of pollution but there are people in this community who
who think that
it's gone beyond the part of being part of the charm of the community to the point of being part of the pollution
and we're very close to the to the grand canyon
where air pollution is a very big issue
because on of pollution well it's debatable as to whether it's coming from the los angeles area on the jet stream or whether it's coming from the four corners power plant up near page arizona
and that's because we're in a volcanic region
and we have dirt roads in a lot of areas that are covered with cinders but what they also cinders on the highways in the winter time
in place of using salt or substances like that they might in the eastern part of the country and when the snow goes away and it dries up and the cars drive over it we get a lot of cinder dust kicked up into the air and as of
you know the largest quantity that's the biggest pollutants that we have to deal with here
right
does dallas sit in any kind of i've been there but i don't remember if you sit in any kind of a trough that where you get temperature inversions that capture air pollutants or anything like that
sure
i laugh because i made the journey once from el paso to dallas and then continuing east to the eastern coast of the united states and i joked that all of the settlers
yes
um-hum
right and
yes
and
here in flagstaff juniper is the very distinctive smelling wood that you can smell in the wood smoke and one of the issues here ah it which gets into forest management but has an impact on air pollution
is that we're surrounded by the largest stand of ponderosa pine in the world
but people don't wanna burn ponderosa pine they wanna burn oak which is very hard to find in this region or juniper because it's the more plentiful hardwood
and aspen it burns very cleanly but doesn't put out a lot of heat and ponderosa
we also have pinon but it like ponderosa is very dirty
and so they're not preferable woods and so here we have this great abundance of ponderosa pine
and the forest service is saying we really wish that we could find a way to make it less of a
basically there's the you know expenses that
are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every month and
we enter those into a spread sheet
you know what sort of range we're gonna
generally gonna shoot for
um-hum
wow
yeah
all the
checks yeah
right yeah we found that
it's definitely helped get a handle on kind of
money for things that
you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to let things get out of hand we thought it
thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early
because of this and stuff like that so
yeah
um-hum
yeah the other the other thing that we've found that helps if
you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to get out the money in advance and put it in
so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever just put it in a
in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to stick to that amount
so
we haven't we our initial goal was just to retire our debt completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card
credit card debt and all of that and we're just at a point where we could start thinking about it so
yeah i
um-hum
a study
yeah
yeah i'm actually in the in the
oh really i i've spent three years teaching in public schools and elementary school
uh-huh
i taught in utah and
did you teach in california
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
well you can you can tell me a little bit more about it because i don't think we did that in utah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
um-hum
yeah i see what you're saying yeah i totally agree
oh yeah
uh-huh
well i've i haven't taught in iowa but i've taught in utah and
people there were saying that
the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home
or you know anything but the public schools and the ones that did have you know the kids yeah well
well maybe it was the area i was in but a lot of schools had lot of transient families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side and
yeah and i mean like you said how they were the schools were doing more things for the kids
they thought than they were thirty years ago i mean they were the school i was teaching at the year i left they're considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids
as well as hot lunch and
well let's see generally i don't think there should be much gun control i like to i like to do a lot of hunting and i have my own gun at home and stuff but
the older i get i think the more i believe there ought to be gun control
for instance just yesterday i go out my front door and somebody had shot a dog out of their front door their subdivision and the thing kind of wound up right where my kids get picked up at the bus stop
so
yeah see yeah you look like look at automatic weapons and things like that and you know clearly they have no useful hunting purpose and
when i hunt i use a twelve gauge shotgun it's actually a lot of heavy broacher so it's kind of a short range kind of thing
well i the last time i hunted i hunted turkey actually and you know it's
oh yeah well you're supposed to and yeah you're supposed to sure you have to try to get it out of there
well it's actually i don't know if this is true anymore but it's lead shot saying that you don't want to
you don't want eat a piece of lead but
yeah i think you're supposed to do that also you have to be real careful about what the animal's been eating you know like if you ever hunt pheasant you know sometimes they get into corn that's been like you know has mercury on it or something and
and to keep the because the corn gets treated to keep insect dusts away so if you go in and you dig into the pheasant yeah you can get mercury
yeah well they have i mean i guess they have this atlanta too but i mean they got guys you know running around you know driving down the street with sub machine guns and stuff and
you know i don't even let my wife and kids go down there anymore unless you know i'm with them or something and then we just stick strictly to the mall area you know we never venture outside of that area so
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah i
you know i feel like you know the when they when they interview these criminals you know the burglars and things they that the two things that they say keep them out of a house best are guns and dogs because they
yeah so they know there's a dog there they know there's a gun there you know they're probably not going to rob you they'll probably go to the next house
yeah
yeah
yeah clearly they have some other motive you know i mean their argument used to be you know the communist were going to take over or something well they aren't anymore you know so what's the argument now well
uh-huh
you should live in texas
uh-huh
oh you're in trouble
you don't have a
yosemite sam mud flap back off or anything like that
uh-huh
yeah
oh well that's probably a little more sound investment
uh-huh
right
yeah do you feel that
you're the always the guy that gets called when someone moves or something
uh-huh
yeah
yeah that's it just seems that i don't know if i'd ever want to own one because
i know i've used guys with pickup trucks two or three times and they you know what are you doing this weekend well i'm helping a guy move you know and it just seems like they're always getting the call
well i have a eighty five mercury cougar and i've had it since well eighty six actually so it was still fairly
you know it was a new style when it came out and my wife drives and eighty seven or an wait an eighty seven topaz yeah that's right and so we're a mercury family i guess
not so much on her part but i don't know my dad always bought ford and mercury products so and i like the looks of the cougar
yeah thanks and except for i got a some texas hail storm damage it's a little golf ball action so i've
driving around a with a chinese checker board basically
i got that about a year and a half ago actually two years ago this may and i just totaled out the car
and
so it paid for itself and i'm basically driving almost a free car so
yeah we haven't had a trouble with either of them yet her topaz
my cougar's got like eighty some thousand miles on it it's made trips because we're both from indiana and she moved down here first she pardon
yeah
yeah i've made the trip probably ten times because i was still going to school and she was down here and so it's
just racks up you know about sixteen hundred miles each time
and we just started going in carla's car the topaz and it seems to make the trip pretty well it's getting around thirty five forty miles per gallon
yeah it is especially we were weighting it down a little bit it get it you know on the
it averaged out around thirty five or forty
probably the cougar i got it just for its looks
it it's kind of a sportier model than most topazes it's got the stripping on the side and it came with i think eagle tires
some guy had some salesman had decked it out and
so it looked pretty sharp
no we just got a new puppy but
oh so you don't have children or
oh okay
yeah
that's funny see that's true i never thought of that and
you know oh it's a good and you know loading up the kids you know we haven't crossed that yet so
have you seen these new station wagons they look pretty sharp
i don't know what it was i just saw it going down and mom and the kids were in there and it looked like a pretty sleek looking car
yeah
okay
no more of the panel station wagons anymore
i know they do look pretty sharp
uh-huh
so you bought an isuzu so you're not a the buy american crowd or
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh man
that
no kidding
uh-huh
hello
fine i'm callie in garland
yes
oh are you
yeah you
i know i know aren't they
i love it in the
it was a lot nicer than i expected
i've talked to i don't think they were students one i think worked at a university and the furthest away i've talked to someone has been new york
so
yes we are
oh well that's not did you push the button
did you
now what's
oh
oh
well isn't that neat
isn't that neat
uh-huh oh that's good
that's neat just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess for them
oh
right what made you all decide to put her or what made her decide to go
right by herself
ah
well that's good
that's great
um-hum
right shut-ins and
yeah it really is i worked at one as a teenager i volunteered at
and i just oh i just felt for those people especially the ones that never got visited
that just bothered me
that just bothered me so much especially you know at my age i was probably about fourteen
and that really made a bad impression on me so i've always thought
not really bad of them i mean because they are most of them i believe are probably pretty good for the people but
i don't know it's just a
that would be a tough decision
right
helps yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right
right
right
yeah and get that youth back
you know sometimes that even helps them you know just being around young people the because some of them are so
you know just stationary i mean they'll get in a wheelchair or they'll just sit in a chair and till you come along and really try and pump them up they're just
stationary and i feel like gosh that's all they do all day long
so
so i do love to see young kids go and men take the pets and everything i think that's a real neat idea
yeah
that's
yeah
right
right
it really is it it's sad to think that we would do that to people and you know i've seen them on tv with bed sores and
they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry and i just think how can you do that these people have given so much of their lives you know to
to america you know or whatever and here is here is how we treat them we just put them in a home and leave them
um-hum
right
i think it's
right i think it's neat i think you learn a lot from them
from all their experiences and that's one of my favorite things to do sit around and listen to their stories
i think that's neat because they really have a lot of good insights
that my husband's father is really old he had him late in life and he's he'll be eighty this year
and i just he lives with different
you know people in the family he'll switch from time to time i just
yeah i just couldn't imagine locking not locking him up but putting him in a home and just
lock him up
oh i know i know
right
exactly
um-hum
that's right
i know it
right
that's great
gosh
right
yes
prepare your
well that's great now can she leave on a day by herself
oh man that's neat
yeah
right
right
well we've thought about doing that for my husband's father because he's
yeah
so he i mean i don't think he could get hurt i just hope to god he doesn't ever hurt anyone but he hasn't had any accidents luckily
yeah
right
i saw that on twenty that
they you know they're testing that they're you know thinking of doing that and i think that'd be a great idea because
you i think they do come become less aware and
they just
i don't know they and they don't hear as well for one thing and that doesn't help
right
right at least that way the burden's not on the family of taking their license or their car away
it's on the state
not for any longer than about ten seconds
yeah
yeah i don't doesn't appeal to me either
where i work there's a guy who actually joined the peace corps he worked here for a couple years and then he went to ghana
and
well he hasn't come back yet
yeah he went just recently
well there's yeah but there's actually been a resurgence of people getting into it i guess part partly for economic times
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
yeah
yeah i don't i'm not sure i mean i guess the motivation is partly you want to help these people but i think
it's a lot of people join it just to go to another country and kind of for the adventure of it i guess
oh yeah
yeah seems a little rough for that
but
i don't know i kind of you know i don't mind going to europe you know traveling and seeing the sights but i don't want to have to go to africa to
no maybe they they'll fly you over there and back for free but doesn't seem worth it
what type of work do you do now
okay for who do you work for you work for
oh really i didn't know they had an office up there
sanders avionics
okay yeah i've heard of sanders corporation were they bought out by lockheed and all of that okay
right that's kind of the work that i do so that's why i've heard of sanders i work for i work for georgia tech
in research
yeah you're just kind of biding your time
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah it we're essentially the same although some laboratories are hiring if they can find new technology you know or make an efforts to get into the commercial markets
so we're kind of getting smaller through attrition but there in some cases we're hiring also
well let's see my last home repair i put an office in my garage i took down one of my two car garage doors and i
you know because i wasn't yeah i wasn't changing the looks of the of the outside
and so oh well what they did was i called i'm a contractor myself and i'm a roof contractor so
i went down and got some permits from some roof work that we were doing
and i talked to them about my you know my garage
and so they said well you need to get a permit for this and that and you know electrical and all that kind of stuff so they here's the funny thing they
they wouldn't give me the permit because they needed a pre inspection
okay so they came to do the pre inspection and they didn't pass it because i didn't have a permit on site
put my hand on the on one of the tile walls to support myself
well yeah i think i yeah here in plano that's yeah
it's pretty strange
uh-huh
is that right well here yeah even just putting little patio outside you have to have a permit
yeah it's pretty strange
yeah
yeah you have i think things you know are different from city to city or from state to state but
and he's pretty busy guy i thought anyway and i said well i've got my guys from work they're gonna to come over and do most of the work you know i said i appreciate your asking but
yeah you know i guess i should have let him come over and
and did my garage i mean i wouldn't -ve mind but i you know i thought he was he was pretty busy and
wouldn't have time to do it
but that's how things are
no actually
we do yeah well we don't install we do mostly repairs we do some reroofing with built up roofs
and but we do repair metal roofs
yeah
uh-huh
we do that yeah
we do work we do mostly commercial stuff and we do work on a lot of metal roofs but we don't install them we just repair them
uh-huh
i'd be real careful extreme temperature changes affect the metal roofs
it expands and retracts and
just
yeah
it it's course country and western even i've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be
right
course garth brooks lives about you know his home town is about fifteen minutes away
uh-huh
my son is twenty eight so but he he's real unusual in that he likes a little bit of every kind he likes jazz
and blues and course the rock
i can't say he's real crazy about elevator music as he calls it
well my teenagers are all gone i can listen to any music i want to
you know i teach
and we can have music in the classroom but it you know it can't be the rock or anything like that and i find that the classical music is very good for the kids too
it doesn't disturb them and yet it it's it stimulates them and
and
but
yeah i'd learn it too
do you play any instruments
ooh you took on a good job
oh well my son played the sax and drums my daughter the piano organ and french horn
so
oh okay
oh that's a
and i love music i cannot carry a tune in a basket
i know what i like but i you know and i love to listen to it and i love to sing
and i my kids when i was little and they were little and i was rocking them singing to them they'd say
okay start us
yeah
right because it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse
yeah
it already has
right although they are doing a whole lot more than they were five years ago you know they're living longer and their medicines are a whole lot better so they're not having to go through as many of the as of the other diseases
or so it sounds anyway as you know when all of this first started out they came down with every single disease that came down the pipe because they had no immune system and they suffered so much worse
so you know at least they're making progress but they've got to get it stopped they've got to find a cure
so have i
yeah
well yeah
well especially with you know surgeries all the time
it's so scary
uh-huh
right
right
yeah and you know well with the time factor it could be up to ten years
you know so that's what's so bad and you may test negative this time but you may test positive you know two weeks down the road
so
the test is relevant for that very day but not necessarily forever
yeah
yeah
yeah and like when i went in the hospital you have to sign a paper saying that you'll allow them to give blood if they if you need it otherwise they won't do the surgery
so what do you do i mean yeah you're given the option of signing or not signing but if you say no i don't want the blood then they may say well then i'm not going to do the surgery
right what can they do
well that's right and they've got to do something about it they can't put it on the back burner
and just say well you know the research is going on is doing good enough because it's not there's no cure yet
you got it
yeah
of course i don't have that problem
slight chance you think
that's
then we'll talk
yeah well they're doing a lot over in europe
with it
and i know when randy was so sick he was having medications flown in from europe because he couldn't get his hands on it over here and
uh-huh
yeah so he was he had a lot of medication coming in from europe
and then he finally was able to get the what is it azt over here only because he had connections that was not open to the public at that time
so
i don't know but they've got to do it because it's everywhere
to everybody
of course
that's right
there's nothing to lose so you may as well do whatever you got to do
yeah or if it was one of my kids
right no problem
yeah
yeah
little over two years
little over two years and at that point he was the fifth
longest survivor
but see that was almost four years ago
and now they're living a whole lot longer
so but he i mean jeez he had everything under the sun he had hepatitis he had meningitis he got throat cancer
and he never smoked even a grapevine much less a cigarette you know
just you name it he just oh it was horrible it was horrible
yeah and then i had another very dear friend of mine die four months after randy did
and he didn't know he was sick he'd just you know had a cold that he couldn't shake all winter
and kept getting sicker and sicker and finally went in the hospital and had pneumonia and both lungs were full and he died within about sixteen hours of going to the hospital
yeah
yeah and his friend had died the year before
and they swore it wasn't aids but i know darn good and well it was
you know so
ooh it's just that that's close to home
you're kidding
my gosh
uh-huh
well at the moment i have a little vacation house back in the woods and it's brick and it has it's pine paneled
well kind of because it's temporary
okay and it but if you know if you want to talk about other kinds of homes my son is a builder
in oklahoma city and he was visiting a couple of weeks ago so we went around to see all the homes that they how they build homes in charlotte
what kind of materials they use
kind of originally from this area from virginia area but yeah
but moved here from oklahoma city
well no but we spent twenty years in oklahoma we're a mobile society
yes it is to love it
in the immediate area because we're in the county with the
farmers kind of farmers they're about you know around ninety already eighty nine or ninety but their children have grown up and they have built then more contemporary
but all traditional they're some are -temporary but mostly traditional
how about your home
are you interested in
oh gosh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes um-hum
um-hum
oh my
yes
yes
uh-huh
yes
um-hum
sure
my goodness
you are multitalented
you are multitalented
uh-huh
sure
sure well if you were to do it again today what would you have done differently
name things say
uh-huh
uh-huh
is that like a galley kitchen
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
yes how does that work in the winter
it burns it up i'm a plant former plant person and business uh-huh so you know
oh my
yeah well do you not have shade cloths and so forth and
uh-huh well
yeah
yeah
um-hum
well great
yes
well come south and you will you will be watching the azaleas bloom and go they are just about gone this time of the year
we're all
no huh-uh everything's green all the leaves are out and all that
so it's pretty
really
well for not summer crops summer crops it's really not time to plant okra not quite the ground isn't warm enough but
some of those
um-hum
um-hum
yeah right get that out early um-hum
sure yeah
no you don't want to be on ladders do you
you don't want to be on a ladder
um-hum
um-hum
well it certainly has been enjoyable talking to you this morning and hope to hear from you again sometime if they do that
good-bye thank you
okay have you returned anything lately
hm
um-hum
um-hum
hm
now okay wait a there was a topic talking about returning lawn equipment
or was it anything
now okay well i returned a camera recently i bought a little minolta camera
and the auto focus was inconsistent sometimes it would focus and sometimes it wouldn't
so after my second roll of film i took two rolls before i got decided because i changed the first roll out before i had the first one developed
and after i got the first roll back i knew the camera wasn't it so i took it back and returned it but most i don't know i haven't had to return a lot of stuff
well i took it back and i figured it was i don't know something like an auto focus i don't know i figured something inherent in the camera design or something
and it works great and he's never had any problems in fact he's had a couple of them and this is a like a little small one you know and the new smaller cameras are like all mass produced and stuff
so they're not i think they're i would think there there's better quality control on those things you know just because they're small and stamped and there's not very sophisticated
so i guess not call it quality control but you know since they're so generic they wouldn't there's you know
i my dad has a big sophisticated camera and it always takes good pictures so i just said well hell with it i'll just go out and get a nice camera
but so i took it back and i bought a
i bought a more expensive camera but you know i think when i was in college i was always buying like just cheap stuff that would make do and that's the kind of stuff i took back because you bring it home and you're like oh well this sucks you know
oh um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah and i think the way i was raised my parents always used to buy stuff that had a good quality name on it and you know they knew the quality of it before they bought it
so i don't know and i kind of do the same thing i guess so i haven't had to return a lot if i had to return it it's more because i realize i didn't need it or you know not because it's defective
but more because you know i have the option to take it back and i really didn't need it you know
rather than you know something being broken
but that's the only thing i've returned recently
um-hum
hm
did they send you a new one or did they actually give you a new one at the store
um-hum
um-hum
yeah because i bought some furniture where the top was scratched and i just wrote a letter to the manufacturer well they had a warranty sheet saying if you have any damage send this in
so i sent it in and you know i didn't really think much the table like i said the table was just scratched on the top and
i didn't really it didn't really bother me because it was kind of small
but i went ahead and sent something in and
three or four weeks later they sent me a brand new table top
and it came by truck
and i like it was probably more expensive to ship this thing than it cost me for the table top itself
because it was eighty five dollars for shipping and the it was a like a computer table you know made with just like what do they call pressed board or whatever just particle board
right and the tole table was only like a hundred and ten bucks
and they spent eighty five dollars shipping this top back to me
so i was kind of surprised i figured you know i sent that in maybe they would send me something back saying you know do you want to exchange it or bring it in or send it back or something like that
but i couldn't believe they sent actually sent a brand new one and they no calls no letters nothing they just sent it to me
yeah
yeah
um-hum yeah but
oh well but
um-hum
right
well i know that we have some relatives that live like around the deanne area in there i know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there
no what i'll do recycle because we a there is some bins like behind wal-mart that take some things
yeah because i finally asked because we you know we had all of those milk cartons and there was nowhere else to take them and they had it in front of wal-mart and i ask in wal-mart and they said they moved it just behind
um-hum
yeah
like aluminum cans or yeah that's about what we do too
well i guess down in kind of in north dallas there's a place that'll take almost anything but
i don't just we don't have the room to store all that much you know and i don't want to be running down there every week or whatever i mean
yeah
yeah
no but i guess we kind of we started recycling after we moved here about a year and a half ago we were using baby food and there was just so many baby food jars that
that's kind of what started it and plus some of our neighbors were doing it you know so when i found out some places to take it
and like they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there and i know that they're gonna use you know the money for that to build some kind of
multipurpose field and that type of thing with put lights and stuff you know so you know if i'm not gonna get the money from aluminum i would just assume give it to the city of flower mound to do something with you know
yeah then maybe they won't raise our taxes to pay for all those yeah so
yeah
what's the matter sweetie you need to wash your hands maybe paw-paw can help you sure sorry
she's she'll be two in july
so
yeah well okay bye-bye
okay
well i left ti in january but i signed up for this before i did
oh i think that's a that's a good idea
all right
because i definitely need to make a little more money and i haven't really accomplished that yet but i'm trying
i wish i did i hope you're a person who does things better than i don't have a budget that's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good
oh long range planning budget mode i'm a single mom and i've been just trying to get
how about yourself do you have a budget you live by
um-hum
right
well that's great how about your
it really is it really is you know that was always a major problem in our marriage what i have always identified is i am
so no i i've
i've finally worked myself into a spot where i can budget when i when i was first divorced i had i sat down and budgeted and i had outgo that was much higher than what i had coming in
i tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me and
and so now that i've gotten you know i lost the house now that i've gotten past that i can sit down and say okay this is the reality this is how much money i have each month
the scary thing is as far as long term i don't have anything i don't know if you have an ira or you know and i've got two girls also and i haven't saved anything for their college and
sometimes i have
um-hum
well i'll check that out
uh-huh
you've learned a lot
well that's good to know how
um-hum
well you must have done something you're helping your children in school and you're you know
excuse me jim could you hold on i have someone at the door i'll be right back
thank you i think we might have just screwed up the computer but we'll find out
oh
um-hum
wow
uh-hum
wow oh i'm definitely going to be actively looking into that
um-hum
well that's great to know
yeah that's good
oh well you're doing you're doing just fine and actually i when i talk i usually like to ask a lot of questions i was wondering what you do at ti
oh goodness
um-hum
oh absolutely
yeah
oh i hope you can do that what i did is i was approached and i've i went to ti just right at the time that my marriage was ending i had been a
and also i wanted to make a little bit more money so i decided i'd like to go out and try sales and i'm out trying to sell
exactly
um-hum
okay
yes
they do
i'm going to check that i've got i've got two friends that work at ut i didn't know that at all definitely i will
uh-huh
well that sounds fantastic
well me being from texas
i hope you're ready for this
well i'm not your stereotypical texan i was raised around guns hunting
so i don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect i respect them and what their capabilities are
and on top that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a green beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry
and here in houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country
and here you go here you this will be border line nra which i am not a member of
i mean you i know you've heard this slogan if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns
well you've got well any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such
they get out their little mac ten's they get out there little uzis and they're going to fight with them and it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm
if they want it they'll get it
i don't care if they've got to go
down in new mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border
now my position
although i have absolutely no use for fully automatic weapon anyway
since i am a law-abiding citizen and i have never had a felony
if i wanted to buy one i don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it they want to run a background check on me fine if they want to put a seven day waiting period fine again
if they want to want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that i've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too
well the only well the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has is this guy a convicted felon is he a habitual trouble maker are we picking him up every saturday night for a drunk and disorderly and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems
you know just proving that you're a basically a good citizen
if they want the firepower they can get it
it doesn't matter how restrictive
you're border control points are they'll get it across the border one way or the other
okay now go back to that one to ten scale where one being total gun control ten being none i said about an eight
i said the restrictions i would like to see on for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun i would like to see them go through either
i'd like to see a law enforcement agency not nra
but whether it be the your state police or your county police
for you to be able to purchase a handgun
you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly
handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics
well the in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as a weapon as a as a pistol
well there's
not necessarily a price thing what is
happening at least in this state and i expect to see it in other states very soon legislation's been introduced as
that if a citizen of the state being myself
has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course i can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed
okay
okay you've been to the city
all these people coming around
someone attempts to mug me i would i would
as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because i can meet him blade for blade
now if this legislation comes through he i'm out with my family we've gone shopping we're fixing to get in the car this guy comes out pulls a blade on me i'm going to pull a gun on him now
when you're and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick
then it's still equally matched
having spent time in combat i feel i feel it before they'll get the gun on me
i actually it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody's packing a piece is a is a deterrence to someone saying well i'm going to mug this guy right here but hey he
carrying just as much firepower as i can and if there's if you got to go through a certification course to get to where to where you can carry it in public
then this individual also knows this guy's pretty good with it
now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not that's another trip but
in defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat
even more so when it comes to my wife and son
anybody tries to hurt them i won't even blink
this is where the question of gun control comes in what i consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot
say a person get all of a sudden my combat antenna goes up and say i've got the vibes this guy's fixing to do something i go ahead and pull my piece
and i make sure this persons sees it so he's got no doubt that i will use it on him and i will use it right then
if he doesn't back up that point he deserves what he gets
because i have sent the clearest signal you mess with me you mess with my family i'm going to dust you
as it stands now i've got to do that with a blade
and the only reason i feel comfortable doing that is because of the training i've had
well if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss that's the kind of training i've had i mean it's
fourth birthday
how much does he weigh now
oh
hm
hm
is your dog an inside and outdoor
hm
oh really
huh when he gets outside does in does he run away and then eventually come back or
hm
hm did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own and
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
amazing
invisible
no what is that
oh
huh
oh really
hm
yeah just be consistent and diligent with it
hm
yeah he's indoor and all declawed because i know the average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months and
yeah
so
yeah
now where do you live
oh well we're pretty close then
yes
that are the problem it's the people
i mean they're just an inanimate object until they are in the hands of
someone who is
who is violent or has a sick warped mind
exactly
with it at the time
right
yes it would but then
too the people who
who have guns already some of them they may have had this gun for twelve years before they
become mentally unbalanced and use it
and otherwise i mean if someone is going to get a gun
and is determined to get a gun and commit some act
they're going to get it whether they can walk in a store and buy it or if they have to break into a house across town or
something you know they're going to get one
i've heard a lot of people say why i wouldn't have a gun in my house they're too dangerous
ignorance is what's dangerous
i have many grandchildren and they have all been raised in the house with guns with loaded guns they have been taught
the danger of guns how to handle them
i raised and from the time that she was
three or four
she knew that the gun that i had was not to be touched and that it was dangerous and i never had to worry about her
but
anytime that she would have friends come i would put i had a closet that would lock and any firearms that were loaded we usually keep a
twelve gauge shotgun loaded and then my handgun
and anytime that there were other children in the house i had i put them in the closet that locked just for safety sake
yes i think that these children that find guns and shoot themselves or another child
they wouldn't do it
because they would my son-in-law one of the when the boys were just very small
he was
educating them about the guns and he took a watermelon out and set it up on
this
little rise out on the desert where they live
oh well
everybody sure i started when i was in third grade and i've i still play the piano as of today yes i do
but then again i was also in the marching band i played the drums i played the clarinet i played the trumpet
you know whatever and so and i and i still sing and i sing in the choir today so i enjoy the music it gives me an out
three months
i was gonna say you got as far as the chopsticks huh
oh bless your heart did you ever did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all
oh okay but i mean can you play anything on it other than the woodchuck song no
oh okay
i can still read music if i'm lucky if i if i work real hard i can still barely read the music but see i played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school so
i played concertos and other stuff but i got to the point where i wasn't really reading music i was memorizing music and so because of that
i can't read music as well as i used to but anyway but i enjoy it though i find it to be a good out and i still enjoy the marching band and i still enjoy the singing in the choir so
yes i do yes i do that's in fact that's about the only musical thing that i still do is sing in the choir
but after one semester of it i said nope no
okay now what kind of music do you listen to
i'm not sure what is that
rock hard rock
not hard rock not like the eagle
is that the eagle okay i know what the eagle is that's not too hard no
true
no we just i guess i'm hot on this subject because we just spent three weeks camping
in a recreational vehicle
we took a tour of florida
okay well i was down there visiting the orchid jungle
there in homestead
yeah we were down past miami went down into the keys
well we found it a little bit of a disappointment we had expected some nice warm sunny days we got two days above seventy
and we thought the beaches would be nice but
well key west was just coral rubble
and we did find bahia honda was a fairly nice state park it had a nice beach
but the water was running about seventy five degrees so it was kind of hard to get the kids to go in and snorkel and do those sort of things
um-hum
yeah
yeah
hum
well my wife talks a lot about camping and she's taken the girls on off to girl scout camp a couple of times
but my idea of camping is in a either an rv or in a thirty five foot sailboat
yeah
yeah i did that for a number of years i crewed for a fellow that was doing a lot of racing
and well it was fun it was quite enjoyable
um-hum
yeah
yeah we rented one from cruise america
that's cheaper than a hotel and you add oh maybe another twenty five dollars for that for a camp site
and you know the hookup and water and sewage and so forth
we had a thirty two footer
well it's a big truck but
when you get that big a truck the fuel economy goes to pot if you try to push it at sixty five and you get pretty decent fuel economy at fifty five
so i just had a change of mind set and i would set the autopilot on fifty five and just cruise down the highway well everybody else wants to speed so they wind up passing you
and you just stay in the right lane and there's nobody in front of you and all you have to do is guide it
so it's kind of a pleasant way to drive you
i've found that i get there just about as fast as anybody else because there will be some cars that i'll pass two or three times during the day the same one
yeah because you go down there and some hotshot will go by you that you know he's got a colorful car that you recognize and
the next thing you know you know it's lunchtime he's got to stop for lunch and you just holler at your wife to make you a sandwich
and well we enjoyed it one of places we visited was walt disney world
hi
i'm tina
i live in garland texas
my husband does yeah probably most people you talk to do huh
huh
i see well that's neat
yeah i guess you have to push one though okay yeah
oh really
yeah that's true
well the thing that i found interesting my husband and i lived up in washington state for awhile
right and but here we eat a lot of like mexican foods and up there was no place that we went tasted like real mexican food to me
yeah it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could but it just didn't taste right
and down here we eat a lot more fried foods i think like chicken fried steak is a real big thing and up there it was hardly ever heard of and
we drink ice tea with every meal and
really
yeah
right yeah it never gets real cold so
yeah but when we have a dinner party around here i think a lot of the time a mexican menu is something real popular
yeah
i know that i do a lot of planning with our church and a lot of the times when we get together well everybody will bring a mexican dish or and italian food is real big too
uh-huh yeah how about you what is real popular up there
oh really
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well that's good
um-hum right
they
uh-huh
that probably makes it easier but
right yeah well that's pretty much what we do if dad's not coming home we have macaroni and cheese or something
but they like spaghetti you know that's one meal i can fix and the whole family eats but there are several things that well as a matter of fact i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time because
yeah the children love them and they are real easy to cook and that way whatever meat we have if they don't like it well and my girls don't like beef i don't know
i guess
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah
well most of the entertaining we do is church associated we have a real tiny little house we don't have room really to have people here but we do get together for fellowships at our church and
my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that and
yeah it is and it's fun to i like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
yeah that's truth that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever you like best
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i remember one time we had a progressive dinner it's the only time that ever yeah they are
but the it's the only time that i can remember that i can't remember what food it was i it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with
several people were supposed to bring you know each like a an appetizer and a main dish and a dessert and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers and
yes
right
right either go ahead and fix your dish or call someone that can i know it
well that sounds neat i can't believe you're so far away but you sound so close
it sounds like you're here in dallas
oh
i don't know if i have anything handy we were just about we were getting ready to go swimming and we're waiting on my sister
cara hold on just a second
as a matter of fact my little one is hollering
yeah
i think it probably has been so i've enjoyed talking to you
thank you thanks for calling bye-bye
well mostly well boy scout camps near dallas
in fact i think i know your sons danny and sean right jan novak
but we can talk about camping none the less
they didn't
but we should talk about camping because they're recording this
um-hum
well we used to do a lot of camping in fact before we had kids marie and i would go
we did a lot of canoe camping either in upstate new york where there are a lot of lakes up near lake placid and in that area and in northern ontario which is also full of lakes
and some of our longest trips went for about six days and covered about seventy miles where you canoe
from lake to lake sometimes by rivers where they connect or else you have to portage your canoe and all your equipment to the next lake
and so that was a i think it's a lot in a way easier to go canoe camping because you don't have to watch the weight so much
and it's also cleaner because you can go swimming every day and it's very easy to keep cool and keep clean
and that's
what river was that yeah i've seen the russian river we never went canoeing on it that can get pretty fast
um-hum
um-hum
sure
yeah well you have to be careful
you have to be careful
your guys are going to philmont are they
right so danny's not going again
okay well i'll i'm going with them so
no
really
is this like roadside collection
well now down here we've got you know collection bins in the parks and things but there's no
you know there's absolutely no
that's right
well i've seen you know i've seen examples of communities where they
they take the other approach you know you have to do it or you're fined
and you know i'm actually all for that i don't i'm probably not the
best person for recycling but i'll be damned if you know if they didn't
charge me an extra ten bucks for garbage collection every month i'd be sure and recycle
i mean it's not that much trouble
it's just different communities that pass the laws that say you have to have to recycle
you have to you have to you know on mondays they pick up glass and on tuesdays it's
you know plastics or whatever and if you don't
if your garbage is just out there in a bag and it's not sorted you know they mark you down and
fine you for it it's kind of like
it's the same principal when there's a drought they fine you for using water you know they just
you don't do what they say and you
not that i promote over government or anything but you know the world's in a bad enough state that
you know i
people being the way they are you kind of need some incentive
yeah
right
that's true
yeah no deposit no return
i was listening to karen denard the other night
on the way home from school you know she's got that talk show and
kra
and they were talking about you know a lot of the plastic bottles
you can't just throw all plastics together
and they were talking about you know you need legislation to identify what kind of plastic it this is so you know you know you know
what can be recycled as what
because you know say shampoo bottles i think was the example they gave there's no they don't even give you any indication of what kind of plastic that is
you just can't throw that in with your
two liter coke bottles or whatever
yeah so did i that's it was news to me too i thought it was kind of interesting though
yeah they yeah that or you know things need might be identified and there needs to be a means a convenient means for people to recycle i know for me now i've got to drive
a few miles down the road to do it if i want to do it and a lot of times it's the difference between doing it or not doing it
you know is
whether you can like take it out the back like stick it out in the back
having to throw it in the back of your car
right
yeah way too much well i know just as an individual you know i know how many times i haul out a bag of trash and it's like incredible if you multiply that times everybody
you know on my block in this city it's crazy
right
yeah you're ti right
yeah so am i
yeah it is
i guess there's the other side of the issue that there need to be facilities for processing all this stuff and a market for recyclable goods
and that was something they brought up on the show i listened to was
you know there's all kinds of you know recycled paper but you know nobody's wanting to use it
you know how many people are using how many people do you know that use recycled paper in the office
you know you can you can buy your moore's computer forms for your computer paper or whatever you can buy it with regular paper or recycled and
i'll guarantee you in my building i haven't seen recycled paper yet
so at the same time we're doing all this effort to throw it a way and recycle it we ought to be working on the other end and
and paying the extra dime on a dollar for that recycled stuff
well i think they actually do some of that but again it's the cost the cost of processing that it just
it intimidates people you know it's easier to buy something that's
you know the cost of building is already
yeah
for it it's easy to say but for a lot of people
to do you know if you were building a house and you were going to spend you know fifty thousand versus twenty thousand on materials because your
you're going to you're going to pay for technology that's not mature yet
what are you going to do you know you're going to spend twenty thousand and
and
yeah you mean you're going to do what you can
but
i was surprised i thought this thing was shut down but i
i thought this whole switchboard thing was shut down i was surprised to get the call
yeah
great
all right all right bye
oh my yeah and well plano texas rather than plano illinois
yeah well let's see the three questions are what
very little because they're grown they're grown and gone
yeah because they don't want to know they almost don't want to know us
yeah
yeah we have between the spouse and myself we have six
because i came with a split family and she had
well no there's so much of them are gone and they're doing their own things and
on the holidays a lot
yeah and sometimes they want to do their own thing so sometimes it's just spouse and me and you know what
sometimes that's okay
because you know right because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time
for the holidays
yeah that becomes a drudgery and when you
well let's see i've got
of the six we've got four around here
you know well we're talking like north texas and then one is in vermont monteplier montpelier vermont and the other one's in everett washington
and my second marriage and
and well they wanted to go jr my least son or my middle son excuse me fell in love with washington state and the third daughter fell in love with
vermont so yeah that's where they've gone to make their homes
no
well let's see
i wish to god he would go back
yeah
well i certainly hope so
uh-huh
well it's oh i agree it's never too late
yeah and when you're saying older we're talking fifty up
uh-huh
oh my uh-huh
yes why not because that's a lot of times well it's i believe that
we in that category and i'm not in that category quite yet
but we are seasoned minds
yes uh-huh
yeah it was
yeah settle down we know what we're wanting to study and
we know our limitations
and we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and then the middle altogether
at seven yeah
yes we're smarter than that
yack right so let's see so mine and i don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here
i'm seeing a change that whoops government can't do it schools are not able to and between a person's religion
judeo-christianity and the jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the
mission by the lord to do this very thing so when another group of people step in try to do it they're tromping on our territory so to speak so i firmly believe that
what kind of music do you like
oh now that i don't know
either that or i didn't listen to sons of the pioneers i've heard about
in fact i have a friend who plays hammered dulcimer and sings yodel cowboy yodeling songs and she
talks about
patsy montana
i think you know who that was
no
well that she
that was
i gather an old
sing songs like that
uh-huh
pretty much like rock
or
or just too similar to each other
yeah
well i like all of that i like classical i when i look at my tapes it's hard to tell i like celtic music i like classical
i like some of the new age music
i like blues
muddy waters people like that i like
what else do i
folk music
i like folk music a lot
oh you mean flamenco oh yes that's beautiful
yeah flamenco's beautiful
yeah
well that i like and i used to live in mexico so i like i like mexican music to a certain extent just because it reminds me of that time
and then
do you play anything
you mean yours and everyone else's
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
and do you do it do you play
yeah
well i
and get and get back into trying something with music huh
oh you do
oh well that's great
yeah
no well i played the piano you know as a child
for years and then quit and then kind of enjoyed it and took the guitar and
played the guitar a little bit and i can sight read and we have a
piano my son was a percussionist and so he has we have a marimba and a drum set if i were to take anything i think i would take drums i just loved it when he did that
in fact one time i bought a two hour session with his teacher for a
lady who said she would had always wanted to go and just play all of those percussion instruments that you see including the gong the big gong
and so he let us into the percussion room and we got to play on every single instrument
what
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay dee are you familiar with the latin american policies of late
um-hum
really yeah it's not mine either but i know
they live there and they have to travel by boat forty five minutes to get to their car and stuff
and i know that they helped a lot of those sandinistas refugees
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i think their policy with them that though is i don't know i think
i wish we would have just i'm not that up on the policy of way i know that's kind of old but i don't know i just i'm glad that
most of the leaders in latin america are probably you would be safe to say that they were just very you know big into drugs
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their
you know the atrocities that they've commit and the drug dealings and in the just in the drug crimes because i feel like a lot of the leadership of those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they're moved from power
that you know but there's so many of them that the next one to come up if you just knock one off you going to have another one
and i know a lot of those nations there's oh brazil i know is like forty percent evangelical christian not just go to church but
you know really on fire for god and they're just surpassing america latin america by
the drugs you know it's just incomprehensible and so i just think that i think that god's going to honor that and that he's going to put in some good leadership and i know the president of i believe costa rica
is a christian and he goes to no guatemala because he goes to virgo church in guatemala city our church is in real close relationship with him
and he is a former president of guatemala he's an elder at virgo church and
you know that god is doing something he is raising up some leaders and the people want him back as president bad but they have a rule in guatemala that he can't have another term
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum yeah i know
um-hum
uh-huh
i know that costa rica they don't allow anybody to come in that
to come in any what do you call what do you call immigrants they don't allow anything like that like i could not go to costa rica and live
as an american citizen they would not permit me to move there to work they wouldn't their jobs are there for costa ricans they don't allow people to move in like less nations you know and take the jobs
no they don't take any i mean i couldn't even go there my husband couldn't we would have to receive all this special permission to go there
for even when some you know in inner
company you know transfer or something
and i have another friend from costa rica that she was born there she's costa rican i guess i do know a little bit i went to mexico city one time
and stayed i've been there twice and stayed and that was just really sad but a lot of it though is their debt i think that we should not loan them anymore money that if we still want to give them money give them money
quit loaning it to them you're not going to get it back don't be indebted to anybody don't be the you know loaner nor borrower and it's just not good we need to if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them but quit loaning all the money out which i don't think we're loaning anymore now but
that's how we got into a problem if we got them we have sink them in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars that common sense you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back
um-hum right
uh-huh
lo mas yeah
yeah but we are now it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money
that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them you don't loan money to people like that i mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out fine but you don't go making
billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation and yeah and know that they are not going to be capable of paying us back and
that puts a bondage on them it makes you know pressure on the nation and on the people on the leadership and makes their inflation go up and it's just a big mess so
no but i knew people i was there before that but i knew people i got a letter from a friend of mine that i had met there that who the apartment building was destroyed and they were living in a tent so it's kind of weird you know
because these were people he was on the us dive the mexican diving olympic pool he'd go watch them dive and all this so they were you know just normal people weren't squatters or poor people or anything that
i did i knew all of my friends there but none of them that i know of got killed in it
man there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot lots of witchcraft a lot of witchcraft a whole lot of witchcraft
so a lot of it in the name of christianity
so you know oh yeah there's a lot you know they call themselves christians but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff and
just a whole the lot of it's a generational things too like the mayans and the incas you can't find a trace of them because god totally destroyed them for how wicked they were
and yet they're revered and honored and almost worshipped by so many people even now in america you know everyone's all intrigued with all of these indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth
i don't think there are the little box is black on the top of the pyramid of the sun it's black so yeah you can't really tell but it is kind of weird you know you think wow there is where they did human sacrifices to false gods and
at that time i kind of did it was a very oppressed eerie just you know feeling but i wasn't a christian when i went there but i think that all those
those you know generational things i think that god did i'm praying you know over the christians now are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray and because that does affect things you know those the when your background
well i can profit by this because i'm due with my first in about three months
i guess not i suppose you're absolutely right there um-hum
um-hum of aren't don't they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their for their pet theories or some such thing
yes
well the thing i really worry about is the sexual abuse cases you read about
and i mean you just feel awful if something like that happened
um-hum
oh
um-hum
um-hum and another thing is cost
i mean i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now and they finding some cases they're finding that it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in day care
hm
hm
hm
hm
hm well i'm just thanking heaven my husband just got a new job his last company he was only working four days a week so it's and he just got a new job he's getting lots of overtime he got a pay raise
and so i'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not
i suppose
um-hum
um-hum
you have to start wondering if they don't want yes
hm
i have one but i haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while
um-hum
this is true
ceramics sounds interesting i do computer programming kind of as a on the side and i also like to do gardening and also like to workout
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i work with computers at work and then i come home and i have a little lap top at home that i just like to play with
yeah
well pottery sounds interesting have you made a lot of a lot of vases and things or
what kind of
oh
um-hum
um-hum
huh
do you have your own kiln or do you do you
oh
oh well that doesn't sound like it's too expensive a hobby does the clay and the paints and things are they expensive
um-hum
well that doesn't sound very expensive to me
um-hum
yeah
hum
uh-huh
hm
well
well children will tend to do that
oh
well i enjoy working out when i get home from work just to just to have something to do that i know isn't going to that's good for me something to do other than
excuse me
uh-huh
occasionally i'll record one of the shows that's on in the morning while i'm at work and i'll do them when i get home
hm
yeah well i really
i enjoy doing that
that is that can be a big workout do you play volleyball a lot
hm
yeah

hm
yeah i enjoy volleyball i'm just not very good at it and i end up
uh-huh
wow
yeah
oh
i have several friends that play softball they play softball in different church leagues
around town
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
no kidding hobbies are supposed to be enjoyable they're not supposed to be difficult or they're not supposed to make you less relaxed than when you began
uh-huh
well i have a computer information systems degree from school and i've been at it awhile so you know you just kind of learn the tricks of the trade and
and move on
hum
yeah
yeah
well i need to run i enjoyed talking to you
sure bye-bye
i think sidney sheldon is probably my favorite author
so i like you know i like books that are pretty high adventure and just real simple easy reading what about you
oh that's good that's good what book have you read that you really like
do you like about recent people or people in history
both
oh yes that's wonderful that's one of my favorite books that's really neat yeah i like books like that too
yeah that's a wonderful book that's funny you should mention that one
oh okay
oh i don't know with all the hip and hype i still love gone with the wind i haven't gotten a copy of scarlett yet but
i guess that really is my favorite book
no i never have
are they historically based
uh-huh i like historically based fiction
oh all those books by john jakes came out
are you familiar with what i'm talking about there were like huh
oh it started with the bastard and then it when it came over to the united states and took us through the revolutionary war and the civil war i've forgotten what all of them were
they were right around the centennial year though
and they were really
you know i really i got into them and read i guess probably four or five of them and then i got burned out and said oh i think i'm tired of this group i like ones that are families
like you read one and then you read about the next generation and the following generation
i think they also asked do you ever read books for self improvement
what do you mean by illustrations
right
do you know what i hate i hate to read books by people like how to raise children and they're single
hm
was it good
hm
i don't know i don't get off on them just a whole lot i get bored real fast
yeah i love humor
yeah
okay i've enjoyed talking to you
okay you too bye-bye
um-hum
baseball
more so with
their management than anything else i'd i don't follow baseball that closely
but you know since i live here so close to arlington
that's the team that i've been kind of following
um-hum
right
well i think that
so much controversy over ruben sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's
you know i think
yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and if the rangers will go up a little bit
yeah but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five that's a lot of money
yeah they are
um-hum and i really think i really think that they ought to
i'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money i think they should
pay him what his salary's going to be
and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent
and then who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway
but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for a lot less than they would if they paid him the you know the six million dollars a year this year
uh-huh
oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him
yeah it was a great deal for him and he just signed on i think it was like a five year deal with
pittsburgh so you know he's real happy there as far as the rangers are concerned i think
i think they need some definitely need some pitching
and so i you know i
the pitching coach
well you know i was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a black guy that was helping out
his assistant and i think that's a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and
oh you don't like howse huh
oh tom grieve
yeah i'm not sure that they're ready to get rid of tom grieve yet
but howse might be a different situation and i think you're probably right that they
that they need some you know some changes in pitching coach maybe and
you do huh
oh i know you know it's too bad that it has to be a forty two year old guy to lead the rangers you know
they need to have some young guys that can take the lead and
and
yeah
uh-huh
i guess it's not totally
it's well it it's such a complicated thing and let me just relate to you
an experience that i had with politics at a lower level and i think what it boils down to is that if you can't find compromise that you're not going to be successful
which was actually at the time we were the third largest chapter in the world we had five hundred plus members
and it was just i mean an absolute unforeseen thing that a woman should become president in this good ole boy city okay
don't misunderstand me now but it all came down to the fact that you had to be able to deal i mean we had our board our officers and our board of directors of about twenty people now this is a good size group of people to manage
and to come to one voice on certain things you understand
and in my year we did perfectly fine and the gentlemen that came behind me was a wonderful intelligent smooth really good looking successful young black man
but he had his own agenda and he wouldn't compromise with people he thought that because he was president he could drive through whatever he chose
and it was a terrible a terrible situation
i mean the whole thing almost fell apart
and i think what you have to do i mean i think it's important that you have an agenda but you also have to be able to compromise on it because if the majority are against you
and you lose more than two or three times you know you lose it been a terrible situation for you and for your reputation
and i think what happens is in order to get anything passed in the big political system in washington you have to you know compromise with other people and vote for something maybe you don't really believe in
but so that they will vote for something that you're asking for
yeah uh-huh
yes it would
and you know there's probably about ten percent or maybe less than that five percent of the people who can vote their own conscience and still be successful but all the rest fall by the wayside
right i am
yes
uh-huh
do you
uh-huh i always enjoy watching this the dallas and pittsburgh together you know
does he really
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh wow i wonder if he'd ever do that
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh well what about the houston oilers do you like them
uh-huh
uh-huh and warren moon is proving himself quite well right now
uh-huh he's one of the few black quarterbacks that there are
uh-huh
i don't know i hope they do better they during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better
or if they even reach that potential again you know they may never reach that again
uh-huh
yeah four in a row
i think mike webster was left but then he just left
yeah i think he is i think he was
uh-huh
huh-uh
yeah
uh-huh
well who would you say is your favorite player or has ever been your favorite player
uh-huh
oh
really
uh-huh
yeah
oh you know that's really funny well i come from a large family and there's quite a few boys so that's kind of how i got in with the football with either watch that or watch nothing and
at one time i could name all the players on the steelers you know and but even when bradshaw was playing i don't know i didn't particularly care for him i thought he was kind of cocky or something uh-huh
yes uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah him and franco harris i really didn't care for the either two of them
lambert ham and stallworth and swan
yeah
uh-huh i like not just with the pittsburgh i like watching on saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the best plays from you know the week or something
yeah uh-huh it's funny that more people don't get hurt
you know especially i would say the receivers when they're in the air and they get tackled
oh yeah it's funny some of their necks don't get broken
yeah
an they have to be in ideal physical shape basically
yeah well what did you think of a couple years ago for the bears the refrigerator
oh you know and to me he does oh he's just so big and fat he doesn't even look like he's in shape he's just so big no one can move him
uh-huh
yeah
wow
uh-huh
oh yeah there's there are some really big guys playing in football
uh-huh
yeah you would
uh-huh now who would you say that you have a i mean other than dallas would you say that you have a favorite quarterback i mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the attention you know
yeah i enjoy watching him play
yes he is i enjoy watching him also
what about marino
i think he'll get better as he gets older
because he well he was the youngest quarterback there was wasn't he
uh-huh
that's true that's true
probably around twelve
uh-huh
yeah i didn't i don't know i just think you know marino will get better and his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the super bowl you know so
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh and they're so young but they're retired you know and their so young still
oh
oh yeah but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah what do you think of the la raiders used to the oakland
yes they have uh-huh
be required to do public service for a year or two and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family
or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to i mean you can't make it everybody
but then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and maybe send them in their place or get out of it some other way
too
give physicals to the rest of the family members and they all had to pass
i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money
and if they did this maybe help them out in their college cost and maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something so they could subsist
yeah
yeah and you know all these old people they would get out of this right all the ones that are already retired so what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes
well i thought it'd be a good idea if maybe you took the some of the kids and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came over to ours too
a trade off
yeah
and other than that i can't think of any other ideas
oh with wpa
yeah
and we're still using those things too
we're still using those things
they built lodges before too like at caddo lake
caddo lake
it's between texas and louisiana
virginia oh that's neat i talked to somebody from ohio the other night
um-hum
yeah
so what have your other topics been
what do you think about the social changes for the last ten twenty and thirty years and what do you think has caused some of the social problems
that have been it's probably the best one
and we had to talk about air pollution too
what do you think's causing it and what should we do about it
uh-huh right
it's because we don't have much coal
in virginia
yeah
well how'd you get into this program
how'd you get into this program
for ti
no
so does your company have something to do with ti
hum um-hum
and do you know how long this is supposed to go on
i don't either i mean it says just keep on until and they'll notify you at first i was thinking it was just a week because that's all it shows
you know on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week
so what do you think we're going to get
what do you think we're going to get for this
yeah money prizes
and i was led to believe that if you weren't ti that you get money i'm not ti
huh-uh
let's see one of my friends had a roommate that worked for ti and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat so she ran off copies of the thing
and i just signed up for it
yeah
uh-huh
okay well thanks a bunch we'll talk to you later bye
this year i think it's interesting we i mean there's so many candidates still that we have well there's we have
he may be drawing off some republican votes and so it seem like george bush has completely locked up the republican although i think i don't
i guess he has but
i don't know i think that's i think that's hard to say i know clinton and brown are both trying to go after whatever the block vote whatever that's supposed to be and
i don't know i think it'll be interesting i know a lot of people have you know are starting to feel are more you know with the recession and everything i think a lot more people are starting to become more politically actively i mean
i think there will be more why what do you think
um-hum
um-hum
oh you see if yeah right
yeah
right yeah i agree yeah
yeah i yeah i definitely agree with you there i mean it's people i mean that don't care much about like federal things or you know things you know
like the deficit people who don't who don't really care about stuff like that really don't have any clues to what's going on like right under right in their own towns or counties or
state or whatever so yeah i agree with you yeah i think people are even you know
yeah
yeah you you'd think people would be more i don't know because they're more in touch they're you know i mean hm
exactly sure yeah and i mean most of them are even you know you'll see them you know you know however many times a year i mean they're actually in your city
you know in your neighborhood or whatever but yeah i yeah it is interesting how that works and people just i don't know they just
yeah i do vote i know if i when i first registered
i guess with the last election i was in my late teens so i only really registered and voted for the who was that then that was dukakis and
yeah dukakis and bush i guess it was the last time that was i guess that was the first presidential election i voted in but
you know not in touch at all
yeah that's true yeah
yeah well i'd say so sure i know i've never voted in any of the just
and why i don't know i just don't see any i don't i don't see any importance at all in my vote in the you know in that in that even that smaller
arena of politics i don't even see you know any kind of influence or anything or any you know
but yeah federally i think people should everybody should be you know should definitely be
aware of you know the presidential elections they should be you know
yeah they should they should participate you know
jeez now that's hard to say it's hard to say who votes and why
yeah i mean
yeah oh it is it is and
i tell you what here in dallas it's awful bad because that they're i believe there's starting to be a lot more violent type crimes
where you see armed robbery and rape and murder you know are starting to be a lot more prevalent in this area
and that's getting that's getting scary because i grew up in a real small town and i moved here to dallas and it's been a rude awakening i tell you
right
well see it's it it's really just a suburb i really can't even tell where plano starts and dallas ends
but i grew up in a real small town in north texas and moved down here to plano an and
it's definitely a big change
right
i see
not really the violent crimes then
i see
i see
right
okay so that's real close
right
right
oh lord
right
you know i've heard about that also for tennis shoes
yeah i tell you what though if you go price some of those tennis shoes i can see why now you know they're getting up in the hundred dollar range
and that just seems ridiculous
for a pair of tennis shoes yeah
so
i don't know what the answer is though to try to fix that problem
right
exactly yeah just overall economic times around here in texas have been tough
yeah
right
to get it yeah
well another problem i think is the drugs
you know people have to get money for the drugs and
and they'll just go out and do anything they can to do it
right
right
right
exactly
right
yeah it's hard to get a job you know
right
you know we really haven't because the oil industry just hasn't come back like it was
and so much of our economy was based on that
so
yeah
right that and real estate you know just have not come back even close to what they were
and yeah dallas is you know you can see some economic turnarounds but and i don't think it will ever be back to what it was because it was you know it was really blowing and going there for a while
i see
right
right
right
and
right
that's right
what's going to stop them from you know other people to
well that's true too yeah
but you know the violent crime is definitely something's got to be done on that
because
right
golly that's ridiculous
right
right
they just overlook that as common occurrence
right
oh that's
golly that's terrible isn't it
right
well see i'm not either because i'm really not for higher taxes you know to go out and pay for more people to be out on the street
as far as the officers and things like that but
i think yeah that's true
and
right
so i don't know
well i do too and you know i know people argue that that's really not a deterrent and people don't think about that but i've got to believe that
in the back of their mind if they know they're going to go out and kill somebody and that you know they're going to get the death penalty then and that it will actually happen
you know so many so many of these jokers get the death penalty and then you know just end up in prison
right
you know with the chance of even getting paroled and you know that's just
i just don't understand that
but
right that's true yeah
right
right because you know a lot of countries just shoot you on the spot you know forget that trial and the jury and all that you know they just
that's right
right
exactly
exactly and
you know i don't even know if they are worth rehabilitating if they go out and commit some of these violent crimes
so but i don't know what the answer is we'll just have to i guess each person will just have to try to do their part and
right
uh-huh
um-hum
and i was glad it was over by then i've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there just because you know we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like
for some of them it was just kind of i don't know not so much a holiday i guess that's how they tend to talk about it
but that they just kind of lived out in the woods and every now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd come back and you know
but that they weren't really allowed to do anything i to me it seems like we only went halfway if even halfway
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well i think we did i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't
we weren't prepared for
i guess the best word is the atrocities of war
i mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war i mean they you know they seemed like a valiant thing you knew you knew who was good you knew who was bad and it was a it was a traditional
the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you know whichever way it is but in the vietnam war it seems like it was
of course the laotians and the cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved but
yeah
yeah
well
our public schools are really poor i feel
i'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation but we're toward the bottom
and there's a lot of things that i see
that are so obviously wrong
that you would think it'd be easy to correct but the system doesn't allow for the corrections
yeah how about you
oh yes
yes
and cobb county is better than the county i'm in she was in cobb county
uh-huh
okay
well that's great
um-hum
well i feel that we're way behind i have a son that is in the fourth grade and they have just now taken up division
i feel like
there are several areas that we're just really slow in and
i don't blame the teachers as much as i blame the system it is
well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system and the money they do have they're not they do not use it wisely she my son's teacher has twenty seven students
and that's certainly is a lot of students for one person
to deal with on an every day basis
but more than that i don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children
and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keep the ca class in an uproar and you're not at liberty
to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office and
it you know it can you it can really be bad also i think
we have a lot of
hispanics
and we have a lot of the county i am i'm in the minorities are mostly hispanic
but it is a problem
especially in the inner schools inner city
you know
um-hum
yeah
but your teacher had control
um-hum
yeah i believe i was too
well it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school we just cannot afford it
if
community doing on recycling
where do you live
do they have the collection points where you can oh okay
yes we're really behind the times here about all we've got is paper recycling and aluminum from cans north carolina
i keep my newspapers and take those down and aluminum cans i keep those if i ever get them i don't drink cokes or anything like that so i don't usually get any aluminum cans
but that's all they've got set up they've got a central collection point at the jc park and that's it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah and you and you and you also get rid of it so
oh yeah that's why i just let it sit there and let it let it rot away and it's a good fertilizer
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
exactly
hum
um-hum
hum
yeah i've seen i've seen pictures of seals that have gotten their necks stuck in those plastic
oh what do you call them they hold six packs together those
yeah because they they're playful and they think this is fun we'll stick our head through here and they get their head stuck in there and they can't get out and they strangle
and i
or they starve because they can't eat
yeah i mean it's that's yeah that's terrible i mean i like seals
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's what it bothers me the same thing about netting tuna they get so many dolphins
and
and i
well they keep saying that but i'll tell you i saw a program not too many months ago
i think it was on arts and entertainment or discovery one of the two and they're talking about all these people who are making all these boast that you know we're dolphin free and all that kind of stuff and they just they showed them to be absolute liars
yeah because you know people like starkist they don't go out there and catch the fish they buy the fish from other people
and all these people do is tell them oh no we have we have these safety nets now
sure
that's right trust us
yeah they had some they had some
undercover film of these people and they netted oh i mean dozens of dolphins
and they killed probably half of them
yeah it is i like dolphins too
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
well i think what they need to do is to come up with a better way of shrimp farming
i mean there's i don't see any reason why they can't i mean there's a lot of places japan for instance have shrimp farms i mean they raise shrimp
just like they raise anything else and you can do it and the collection is very easy
and you don't go around killing everything else that happens to be in the area
um-hum
yeah
right
on fishing yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well it's
um-hum
yeah
yeah and
yeah is right yeah they're in it for a matter of survival not
not environmentalist
oh yeah they probably are i
of course i don't understand why they don't if they're going to kill them they might as well eat the turtles too and
oh turtle is good
yeah
yeah
yeah i had turtle when i was in vietnam didn't know it was turtle at the time because i wouldn't have eaten it but
yeah i
sure right
yeah why not give it a fancy name and put a high price tag on it
no i no i don't think we will because you need some kind of organization for it and
yeah and the problem i mean we've got all these environmental organizations but they're all pulling in different directions and it's the end results is just a nullity nobody's getting anything done
and i think there needs to be a concerted effort you know say okay here's a problem we're going to do this and you put all your resources here and we're going to do this and you put your resources here something like that i mean just
um-hum
yeah well that's what i mean about all these groups they're so
yeah they're so
they
yeah i mean i mean you'd ideally they would all combine together and pool there resources and
and then they could have their agenda for all these different problems and come up with solutions but i mean you know work at it as an organization not as a little group
that's right that's right
um-hum
exactly
yeah somebody to pull the whole thing together to make it work
i mean we we've been at this for so many years now and just and nothing's happening
alrighty i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution
as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
does your work entitle anything in environmental along these lines
um-hum
very
yeah it's having well i work in too i work in environmentals projects right now and so the sherman deal is
and a lot of their rules and regulations aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the tacb which is located in austin in writing and hey look what we've done here at ti
and we are presently in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to
this is air side allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage it's in tons per year
and so you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems
that scrub out the nox and vocs and the ammonia compounds all the acids
to a certain level we are very aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions so if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or there abouts
and so what we go through is if you see it smoking there's a problem and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking and you have to get it fixed el pronto
as you know the they're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so it's a full time everybody has your home phone number type of job
the sherman facility we are still in the
closer to but still have a little bit of finalization to do right it's been pitched to the sherman city council with open arms as well as the public we had open forum and
tom jones our environmental corporate environmental guy's handling the project
and it's real going real well i think it's matter just a matter of fund the funds right now as i understand it
but it's something else yeah they're in the same issue we were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there
because the system is setup where it won't have any emissions you're correct it will have something coming out of the stack obviously just because human nature but it won't have any
any bad stuff so i think ti we spend of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost
first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here and
it's an interesting job but
possibly
hm
i'm familiar with that one
we have stuff that's very interesting yeah
we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where they have that we sample and it may have over a certain emission levels this is on the solid side and so we take it
and we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid and we mix it with concrete and actually potash per se and concrete and then actually put it in the ground
but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab
which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave up ductwork and things and so we're very cognizitive and aware of all these type of
expenditures because it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the world a better place to live and i think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would
i've enjoyed speaking with you
yeah
yeah glad to see y'all taken care of well the i think what changed everything and is y'all the only ones that make any money for ti here in the last two years
exactly and that's when you start when you start paying your wages you know jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys
i've exactly i've enjoyed speaking with you see you later bye-bye
well i don't i don't think we're spending enough so i think we i think we should spend more
let's see
you know to tell you the truth i couldn't tell you i couldn't tell you what we're spending but from what i from what i hear
from most of the you know just reading about aids advocacy groups and oh people like that there have been a couple of deaths lately like one lady that was on the president's aids committee
that we're not i it just doesn't seem like we're taking the disease as seriously as we need to
lot of lot of talk about it but we're doesn't i don't know what do you think
yeah
right
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
well i wonder i don't know what the statistics are but i think
it's the numbers of people infected do you know have any idea what they are what they're estimating now
yeah
well i you know what
yeah what i think is that is that somehow in a lot of our minds it's still a disease that affects primarily homosexuals and intravenous drug users
but what we're finding is that it's
it's affecting a lot more people than that there's a lot more
heterosexual transmission of the disease than we probably thought
so
you know i mean as long it's as long as it's limited to those
two select you know two kind of narrow areas homosexuals and intravenous drug users it it's probably gonna get unfortunately sad to say a lot more lip service than it will actually dollars
you know and in all these stories about these kids who had transfusions and these
oh there's been a couple housewives lately that were you know national news that they had -fusions and they you know and they're they died you know and left behind families and
oh
yep
oh you all did in your in your school district or something
yeah
yeah
yeah
i know yeah i don't know kind of kind of scary actually
yeah
don't i don't i don't know that i would
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah and i think as long as it's as long as it's still people that are thinking that it's mostly even people that it's almost like because they're choosing to practice those lifestyles that they're you know that's their choice
that they ran that risk i mean i you know that's i hate to say that sounds
that sounds cold and cruel but that's probably
as long as people perceive of it being that way i mean that probably explains the lack of lack of concrete money and being spent
yep
hm
well here in seattle it's the air's getting more and more polluted to where we're in kind of a basin
and
seattle's on puget sound which is a
inland waterway between two mountains
and there's been a lot of lot of growth population growth around here
um-hum
uh-oh
yeah
yeah i live in the university district and
it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution
i think probably due to a lot of students going back and forth to school
and i'm we're right next to interstate 5 also
oh yeah oh yeah they started doing that yet
and i think they're also gonna be making it
mandatory for more cars there was
something in the law about if you're car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore and i think they're eliminating that
oh really they make you do that remotely
oh i see
jeez
yeah that's neat
but it's also been
oh you know everybody is talking about using more mass transient here but
it
it's tough you know like i've looked into riding the bus to work and
i can drive to work in
but if i
if i take the bus it requires several transfers
and it takes over an hour
so it it's not hard to see why i why i keep driving and you know i feel guilty because i'm driving a
yeah
besides a bb gun no a lot of my family owns a lot of guns and stuff and
yeah
yeah
yeah that's my opinion is that some of these high powered handguns need to go out the window because they're obviously not for hunting
and a handgun was never designed for hunting
yeah
yeah
yeah these the nine the nine millimeter glock to top the charts
it's a it's a plastic automatic weapon that fires
wal-mart
wow
hm
yeah
seventeen rounds of clip that fires by itself
did you hear about the killing spree in colleen over here in texas
we had a guy that went through a luby's in colleen and like killed twenty three people and injured a hundred plus others
and then killed himself
it's a cafeteria or restaurant
yeah several months ago yeah
that's
that's what well nobody really knows what it was it was they determined that it was a series of events over the years of some sort form of hatred of women and that's why he was mostly shooting women
he was just a wacko
but that shows you what a glock automatic weapon will do
he had that and one other gun which i don't recall what it was
but
the glock oh the other gun it was another handgun
yeah it that's what it was he went around putting holes in anything he wanted to at whatever rate of speed he felt like
yeah
i also agree with the seven day wait on handguns that's a
yeah
yeah at the moment they want seven days and that's you know that's the best thing we got to work with go for it
yeah because i really can't understand why these legislatures wanna fight it unless they just don't have anything better to do
yeah
yeah
you should have a permit to use it and a be trained on how to use it
yep
yeah
my dad has borrowed a thirty from
his nephew and is supposed to go hunting and i i'm really kind of nervous about it myself because i don't want him to
go out there and get hurt
um-hum
no
sure
i'm i pretty much specialize i guess in italian and chinese i'm a vegetarian
as chinese gives me a lot of room to play with i've been i've been doing some stuff with middle eastern lately you know cooking up dals and stuff which has been fun
um-hum
wow
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i usually you know i get usenet so i usually just look at the recipe groups in there for interesting things
well what sort of cookbooks do you do you usually use
yeah
um-hum
that's true
um-hum
hm
well that's interesting
um-hum
hm
um-hum
um-hum
do you
yeah i pretty much i guess i stick pretty much i got a couple of moosewood books some
the greens i find to be very handy
other than that i mean i you know i got five or six others that i can i can look up for inspiration or something i don't know but yeah but
right
right
um-hum
yeah i find it's usually pretty useful to cook you know some number of recipes out of a book to get a flavor of the style
and then from that point you can pretty much improvise once you once you understand the spicing patterns and stuff like that
right absolutely
um-hum
i agree
um-hum
yeah okay
nice talking to you bye
hm
um-hum
oh my lord here in framingham they just started recycling and we have to mostly they're doing the plastic bottles which we have to soak the labels off of
and you know milk containers orange juice containers and they're doing the newspapers and we have to sort out the ad pages
and just you know the regular newspapers go in
and we can put like regular white paper in and they've started recycling in the school systems white paper only not yellow paper or lined paper you know just the plain white paper
wow
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum that's what everybody's complaining about they gave us these big restorage bins you know they're plastic they look like milk crates only about they're about three times as long
right
right they're getting to be real stinkers here in framingham too they used to take them no matter what but now they have to be washed out and everything else and it's like nobody bothers anymore
yeah
um-hum
oh that really
yeah you have to take all that stuff out
i like all kinds of music actually
i'm kind of partial to country western i like that
and i like mood music like you know when i'm in the mood for that i like semi-classical
the real classics i'm not as familiar with as you know the ordinary sounds that you hear every day type of thing
uh-huh
oh huh
oh that's fantastic
well we have a similar radio station here
and because of the people i guess being pressured to have advertisers
you know a lot of the stations have to have advertisers they kind of like
compromised
and they do some of it at like certain hours but it's not always at a time when you can you know sit down and listen to it so
you kind of get trapped into listening to whatever there is available type of thing you know
uh-huh
we have that on tv we have two public broadcasting systems channel two and thirty six
also that are publicly supported and they have excellent programming
yeah yep same thing
uh-huh
it is it's expensive
no and the problem is that they can do it at will you know like up the prices
and you're if you have it you just have to pay it
you know that's the hard part
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yep
see we have cable here
and almost everyone here has cable
and it it's good because you don't need the outside antennas with your tv and stuff and it gives you a lot more
of the other you know of the widest television that's available to you
uh-huh
yeah that's what i like
yep right and i love that
uh-huh
have you been to the opera ever
yeah
oh that's nice
i've seen man of la mancha and a few of those you know that in boston and i enjoyed it thoroughly i really did
i've seen a few musicals and i go to atlantic city once in a while and i always like to catch some shows when i'm there
especially like when they have special singers and things and la cage au faux that was excellent
uh-huh
oh wow
well we're only about two hours from there yeah
no
right in fact i
sure is
isn't it awful
oh yeah i think that the commute to and from work has to be the worst horror show
because even the breakdown lane is used for a passing you know a travel lane in the morning
and that's really i think that's a very serious thing you know i'm surprised they haven't had more you know really fatal accidents out there doing that
oh i know it's true it's true
so what are you majoring in
oh and what is that
oh
oh i see
yeah we had someone from do some ergonomics in our area do you do
cover some of that yeah
oh
oh well then this is right up your alley what they're trying
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
really
sure
yeah it's true it is in fact i have a friend of mine that moved to north carolina
she's an emergency room nurse she does the operating room
and she's been down there a couple years and she really loves it
i don't know the city
all i know is it's down in north carolina in fact the last time she was up i meant to ask her
you know what city she was in i didn't but she said it's really nice
no
yeah
oh wow
really
what's the population
oh that's pretty good size though
yeah
yeah
yeah
i liked atlanta too i have a sister-in-law that lives in atlanta
they she in fact went from massachusetts to florida then to atlanta and she really likes it
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
oh yeah
the airport's something down there
it is it's
yes
in fact when we went down to visit one time we just sat there and we watched i couldn't believe
the traffic
it is
i know isn't it
unreal
uh-huh
yep
i went there to visit the underground when that was you know the underground city
and i thought that was really neat
that amazing
oh really
is that right
course i haven't been there in about eight years
so
yeah
five years
the growth in that place is phenomenal
they don't stand still that's for sure
we're having our problems out this way with the banking crisis and
credit unions and all that kind of good stuff
and it's starting to effect you know the economy
because of the businesses that have their money tied up
every place you go you know the
uh-huh
yeah
it has i don't know what they're going to have to do to boost it but they need to do something quick
yeah
yeah
sometimes i wonder though if the presidential election isn't what really did everything in
because he wasn't really paying attention to business you know
you can't do both things well
no true but
yeah
that's true
yep that's true
sure
look at what happened just in washington alone god
it's mind boggling
no
well it's been interesting talking to you
yes
well we work with both we work with individuals and we work with companies and executives and we do business and personal
financial planning and budgeting and investing for those people
how do i handle my own account
well the first part of a good budget or a good financial planner is to number one don't have any debt
oh that's great you're ahead of most of the people out there then
well a budget does not have to be rigid
sure
um-hum
right
and lot of people have not even considered that maybe that a car payment a monthly car payment that they put it in every month whether they have a car payment or not
and therefore they would save up enough money over a couple year period to replace a vehicle when they needed it
uh-huh
well that is called smart budgeting
oh it's real financial planning but we're talking about budgeting so
that is very smart to do
uh-huh
right
right
well with the economy the way it is it's very important that we don't spend capital we don't have to because we don't know when we'll need it
and secondly is that we need to make our money work for us so we don't have to work harder
hello
no i live in dallas i work for the dallas school system
understand we're doing care of the elderly right
and how do you feel about putting someone in a nursing home
um-hum
yes i would find it very difficult to place
my father or my stepmother
ah in a place like that particularly since i know how they feel about it
yes
in a place like that you know aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that's offered and such but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference
and i have a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home have no family who could you know care for her
and i know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about her situation
um-hum
um-hum
yes
yeah
um-hum
i think it would matter too the kinds of
disabilities
that
the nursing home accepts
who poor things you know don't have any real grasp on reality any longer
and they may be ambulatory but they tend to behave like children small children
and that would be very difficult i think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to have to deal with on a daily basis
um-hum
yes
um-hum
yes
yeah alzheimer's yes
okay
for as long as i can remember have had a yearly reunion back
early on they used to rotate them from some to
to different people's houses in the family
and no not no this was well i am actually from mississippi and so that's it was it was around there generally that's where the family
grew yeah and it was not only in mississippi in some other places as well so it was
it was a big deal but they tried to centralize it in one spot so in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year
not getting to go just the distance involved and just not
hopefully next year get to go back because a lot of
the family has not on her side my mother's side has not seen you know my daughter so
i have one brother
so
yes
right yeah
right i usually see her a couple times a year so that's no
no thing but i
i do i do enjoy the reunions the only problem is that now originally when we had them they were mainly my mother's
father's my mother's father's family had quite a few
brothers and sisters so it was a large reunion of that group from that descendancy
and a lot of those people have and at time you know they all knew one another
and now it's gotten that a lot of those people are have died off or you know what we are left with is the relatives of that group
and so it's not quite as close as it used to be so i think people feel less of a of a desire to really go i know that
or they were all in the same geographical location you know back around you know in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up
you know they were all located together in one small community
the family grew and moved away and so forth and now when you when you they come together it's generally you know like say the kids of those people who are not
you know anywhere near one another and i don't think they feel the closeness that they that used to be there
which is a shame but that's just how it is my mother was complaining last year about the you know it's dwindling down every year you know that's just i think that's just
well yeah
yeah that's yeah i think that's some of it but you know i
smaller unit and you know we tend to try to do things i think with our immediate family as opposed to this extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well
right it requires a lot of effort to do that sort of thing i mean i
i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but it's it doesn't you know it's not as many people there that i really enjoy seeing
you know i it's going just for the sake of getting together i think for the family and
no not really in that but then again
you know but i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them but as for the you know for the rest of that group no not really
you know and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion so you don't really feel that
that really close to them
um-hum
um-hum
that's a good idea
right
yeah
right
yeah
um-hum
all right
well we have two cars and on our little honda we had to replace some cv joints and on our bigger car it's a chevrolet we had to repair
yeah
yeah right so we've had just recently a couple of things the cv joints my husband just did himself and i'm glad he can do that because that saves us lots
yes he does and he's lucky in that way too because his dad lives real close and he has a lot of the tools
so he's able to do quite a few things like that and saves quite a bit of money
well we had to have the chevrolet had to be repair done by a repair man the you know the control module and even though that
that still hasn't been taken care of in fact we were driving along the other night and the engine light came back on but
the man wouldn't the repair man when he fixed it said that it looks like the computer panel or the whatever it was needed to be replaced also and we didn't have it done at the time so it looks like we'll need to go back in and
have that done
so how about yourself
oh
oh wow
oh
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
oh
huh uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
my word huh
oh
um-hum
um-hum
oh
oh so do you enjoy doing the repairs yourself
uh-huh
right
oh well that's what my husband says too he says when you have the right tools and a good place to do it in it's enjoyable and he really likes to be able to do it but when you don't have the right tools
um-hum
right
oh
because yeah you can't afford to buy them so
um-hum
right
uh-huh so have you found one certain type of car needs less repair work than another
have you had that many different cars or
um-hum
hm
oh
uh-huh
oh yes uh-huh
oh
oh
boy i'll say i'll say well we i don't know we're a little bit partial our honda we have got a hundred and
here we go
well the changes that's occurred like it how was it maybe ten twenty thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today
how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten twenty or whatever you remember it to be
yeah we are somewhat conservative but as far as the
socially our crime rate has increased and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like
violent crime is on the increase from what i've seen and our prison population has significantly increased i would say
our economy too
is really it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what i've read and
even the well it started
spiraling down i suppose in the seventies
and our recovery
economically has not been like it used to be
to me also our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married
i don't i don't know if can't make any judgments of that nature but
and
kids are i suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to
women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established and they don't no longer feel dependent upon men
that's probably true i mean they are a lot of them that have to
put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters and especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands and i guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected
in fact there was one lady in this area she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day
not a baby she was old enough to
i would say she was five to eight years old somewhere along that range but that's just an extreme example i would imagine you know the situations are out there
i agree there
yeah i could agree with that because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age
uh-huh
that's an agreeable
what else considering beside family economics
our transportation system has changed for us i mean we can it we can now travel around the world in no time
it's just a hop skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast and
well i think what's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up
aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day
and to keep abreast of the
knowledge out there we got to constantly read go to school
tv watching has sure hasn't gone too much out the door because tv
is still well the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular tv programming
and watch a lot of other a variety of programs out there as well as use of the vcr
so that i don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system
do you watch la law
i like that
uh-huh
well that's good at least you're hitting the books right
uh-huh
well that's a change then oh of course going to school too
it's different from the home environment
i agree with your parents
because tv kind of ruined me because that's all that we had
well not really but i mean
it's for the top medium of entertainment
it was
even at your age
uh-huh
uh-huh
i see
uh-huh
oh
is there anything else
a little of course we're having to weather through the savings and loans and
all the other scandalous items that well
the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties
and i think i think it's going to have to have it's patchwork
put on us
because we have so much to pay for now
it's going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others
well it was nice talking to you
and what are majoring in
well normally i like to go out fishing in a boat
and rather than like bank fishing and just like you try and catch anything that's swimming
because i've had such problems of trying to catch any type of fish that i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing
uh-huh i've never tried like with deep sea water fishing
have you
um-hum
oh my goodness
uh-huh
wow
um-hum
oh i bet it is
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
well now i haven't done much fishing here in texas because i moved from ohio
but we did a lot of fishing when we were up there but down here i have a brother that likes to go over on the east
in east texas and do fishing and i can't remember what the name of the lake is
and he was just here this past weekend i could have i think he mentioned it again but i couldn't remember what it was
i want to call it salt fork or
lake fork i can't remember but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places
i you know that may be it that may be it and it
yeah
yeah and he said that he has never gone anywhere before and he's fished all over the united states
in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen
so i would love to go over there they were talking about going over there and some time this spring
and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and
and catch some bass
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah oh
yeah
gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds
and for me that's big that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really big
so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me
yeah
yeah so but yeah i'd love to go catch like the marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
that's right that's right
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
wow
uh-huh
yeah
that's right that's right
right well do you live like along houston
down there
well i meant when you were when you were growing up i mean like galveston
oh okay but you
oh okay
that's close to south padre oh corpus okay
okay
um-hum
yeah i i've been to port aransas but it was when i was a child
yes because i have relatives who live in houston so when would go and we would go to port aransas or then on down to corpus or further
yeah like what your talking about because i was just wondering we went to galveston this summer even with all the oil spills and everything i mean i was
oh it was horrible i well never ever go back i don't think and yeah and that that's true
you know the water was murky and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there
um-hum
yes uh-huh
it sure is yeah it most certainly is so that it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it but i don't i think it's lost a lot of it's appeal
that then because of all the oil spills that they have had and it always smelled the entire time we were there it was
yeah we went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool
because the water was so awful and
yeah
uh-huh
no not anymore
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
wow
uh-huh
wow yeah now i never knew they were that big huh
yeah right well it was nice talking to you
yeah almost everyday
yeah almost every single day from when they started it
yeah
well it's a one story three bedroom two bath two car garage
with a single living area a large single living area
yeah
no it's a closed in garage to attached to the house
so that i can i can leave my home go into the garage get in the car and not get into any weather at all
uh-huh
oh you're kidding that's
to the home uh-huh
wow
uh-huh most of the time when i when i was looking for a house matter of fact the
they would tell you if it were a carport or if it were
if it were a detached garage
so
it's really kind of odd we ah we had hoped not to be in too much of it and matter of fight matter of fact in texas
they have flood plain areas where it's about every hundred years the area floods where the insurance companies won't insure you for it
like
like what is i'm trying to think of the name of that park
yeah they wouldn't cut they will not issue flood insurance
and i can i can see where there's some areas in dallas that are definitely like that
but
was it what kind of home are you in
oh okay is it apartment style or uh-huh
uh-huh
oh okay
gosh
uh-huh
three bedroom uh-huh
well i was that's kind of what i had envisioned from visiting the ones in at north texas university where my husband just graduated
physics
phd in physics
actually they're very enlightening and they're a lot of fun
they are
yeah well most everything touches physics one way or another no matter what you do even if nobody tells you that's what it is it's physics
uh-huh oh yeah mathematics too but
back to housing what kind of a home would you and your wife look for
once you finish schooling
oh really
uh-huh oregon or washington
uh-huh
oh that's a beautiful area
uh-huh
oh i see
that would
okay where do you stand
on
oh you
um-hum
right
right yeah i agree too i
it's as far as the ban goes and everything i don't think it's possible to completely ban guns there's just too many
you know if you really wanted a gun you could you could make one
yeah it's yeah i mean there's yeah there's no way to stop anybody from getting a gun
i think there should be more control as like maybe waiting periods and things like that you know
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
sure
yeah
right
um-hum yeah i know my friend is really into guns and
we went a couple of times with him to gun shows you know they come through town and everything and i mean they just have i mean they have anything you'd want i mean you know you know you know anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and
and there's i mean there's nothing you can just go buy one and take it home and you know it's easier than getting like a video membership card at you know a video store
yeah
yeah you just go and buy the gun and
no well except for the pistols and i i'm not sure how they do that i know they
um-hum
um-hum
right
yeah i think that's
um-hum
yeah i'm not sure i'm not really sure but what the gun laws in pennsylvania are like
no
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah the skeets you mean
um-hum
yeah
i don't yeah i don't i don't think it can happen either it i just don't i don't see and i think hadn't thought about this before but if you do that if they would
decide to ban guns it would just open up a market you know a black market for them
and so you know they would just all the profits would go to you know
yeah
oh the
yeah that's true you know i had i had a friend who was a
you know he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that but i mean you know you're you know people make you know they forget or you know you know kids get in the way kids the way kids are you know i mean they can
you know
right yeah
and i don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction but i notice things on tv being more
i don't know i i've said several times to my husband that i feel like jeez in ten years they'll have just full nudity on tv and nobody'll think anything of it
and to me that's surprising to me that's a big change to accept it and it comes across i think subtly you know little at a time to where you get so used to seeing a little change that
you know when they go one step further you don't notice it that much so that's one of the biggest ones i've seen
um-hum
i tend to agree with you and i think there's a lot of that ah yeah we have become lawsuit happy any little thing it's like let's see what i can get don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from
hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through but whenever something happens it's you made me hit that you made me do this and so i try to tell her brianna
so
i think you're right in your opinion good or bad or both
i don't know i think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like
in terms of their self confident confidence their self-worth you know i can do something i can be somebody you know if i put my mind to it i can accomplish things too and i think that's good but
i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too you know and i think there's definite roles and i think you know part of the break up of the family
maybe it's because of the social changes i don't know the fact that ah
during their early changes where you know women did come more
speak maybe speak out i was gonna say come more out of themselves but speak out i think a lot of men were threatened by that i think now less men are you know because they're used to it it's around them
but i don't know i
i don't know why the families are breaking up i think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions because it's like
they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is gonna work they go in and say well hey you know
i'll stick with it while it's good and then i'll get out
and i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment
um-hum
yeah
yeah
oh
oh no
oh that's really nice
where do you what area do you live in oh okay i live in rowlett
uh-huh
oh that's really nice
yeah it probably will
yeah we have that
uh-huh
right i guess that's just texas though you have to live with that
hum
uh-huh
well we bought our first house at the end of eighty six and like i said it's out in rowlett and it's real nice it's four bedroom and it's kind of a tract area too we've got people behind us and on both sides of us
but it's a it's a good size and it's something we can stay in and grow in for quite a while i guess hopefully till the real estate market turns around like you we
we bought when it was down a little bit but we've had so many repossessions in our neighborhood that we couldn't sell for anywhere near what we've got into it so
it hopefully it'll turn around
sometime
yeah oh i think it will eventually out here they're building more new houses all the time though and people can go and buy a brand new one that's never been lived in for less than they can get a used one so i guess that's what they would choose
but there as a first time home buyer i know what you mean there's a lot of things you're not sure about what to look out for the only really trouble we've had with our house is the seals breaking between the double panes and moisture
gets in there and you can hardly see out of them now they've got so much
yeah but other than that we haven't had any problems
um-hum
oh uh-huh
yeah
we had our insurance our home owner's insurance actually covered some of it because i told them it looks like something's eating into the glass it turns like a milky white you know so i said well how do we know it wasn't some kind of chemical or something that's eating into that which would be covered under a glass rider so
they replaced like seven of them
and we just had to pay the deductible but
they wouldn't that insurance company went out of business in texas because they had so many claims that they couldn't make a profit and so now none of the other insurance companies will consider covering that
which i can understand it's really not
damaged
oh yeah
but i bet we've got at least seven more now that are bad
just about every window in our house i guess eventually is going to have to be replaced
yeah well what they did is just they came in and just cut the glass out of the frame and put more glass in
that's over a year ago and it's it hasn't had any problems yeah seemed to
somebody told me that they thought that too was caused by just a little bit of shifting in the foundation puts a little pressure on that seal and makes them pop open
right
well who wants to go first here
well to me capital punishment is
how should i say it i don't think it's neither the last thing that it's neither the first
but it is
something that i think that is
necessary under many circumstances
yeah my i heard a guy one time who explained it in kind of a natural way he said just outside of my door there's a
there's a hornet's nest and that's you're from atlanta right
oh excuse me dallas do they have hornets in dallas
okay big bees anyway says there's a hornet's nest right outside of his door and he says i hate to do it but i had to
to get rid of them and they were just doing what they were supposed to do you know that's what nature equipped them to do and they were doing their thing and but it was pretty threatening to my family so i got rid of them and then he said now i have he says
and that was too bad it's too bad i couldn't relocate it
so i'm let's see the other question i had i guess was i heard one person on the radio say
in my you're more conservative than some people that i could've talked to but
to do immense harm and when a person chooses to do that time after time i don't have a lot of i just don't feel like they're
you know what's there to say there are people out there that have made mistakes and they're sorry for it i feel bad for them but on the other hand
anything in nature that doesn't that doesn't
rid itself of decay
winds up in pretty sad shape and i think that's what we're having now and so we've got some pretty sad conditions out there we've got these guys that go out there and do drug how should i say it wholesale murders
and
what that means is that the politicians rather than try and clean up this that nest of problems they'll come out to
people and they'll say what you have to we're going to enact stricter laws on the rest of you
you know and so i don't know i i've i guess you can say i'm
well i was just trying to think when they called i didn't have as much time to prepare for this as i did some of the others i love watching some of the new shows basically
and we took we subscribe to cnn and we took that and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during any kind of thing like the earthquake and i have gotten stuck on a lot of this the news shows and the stuff that comes on that
that it you know like the at night the discussion talk shows and things and we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current
especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here
what do you watch
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh that's the same things we do
um-hum
yeah that kind that's the kind i like really more than the sitcoms i haven't gotten into many of those
i have heard that's real good
that's burt reynolds isn't it yeah i've heard that
now someone told me that and also i meant to be trying to pick up on murphy brown because they said that was really good this season
designing women is on that night too
hm i don't even know
oh okay now i we've never even seen that
uh-huh
but we used to like knots landing a lot oh excuse me just a minute the money's right there on the
um-hum
yeah that's what they said it was kind of a little more drama to it
did you like it
yeah
um-hum
yeah well we do too
yeah
i know yeah there's a lot more to do with your time when you get into it
um-hum well my sister and them and her husband do on weekends they don't have children yet and they just turn it on when they walk in they turn it off when they leave
so they're used to that too
yeah i understand same here
yeah it's real good and of course in the afternoons if i get in from work in time i watch oprah some of those you know talk shows i like her okay
yeah
well it's nice talking to you i guess we've kind of exhausted this one but it's nice talking with you
thank you bye-bye
what are they called
oh
oh yeah
well i guess what we have here is the mavericks is that right basketball what is
what is our dallas basketball i'm not really sure
one is soccer one is basketball the mavericks must be basketball
and my daughter plays basketball you wouldn't know it would you from this conversation i'm familiar with the teddy bears and they're my favorite
well now she's twelve so but she's been playing basketball for four or five years on a little team called teddy bears and
that's been fun so now she just made her middle school team so that's
and they've won so far that's good but
yes she likes it a lot yeah she really does and the lakers i guess is my favorite as far as
as anything i know about basketball yeah because i my boyfriend's in california so
i guess because her friends signed up
and she wanted to sign up she twirls and she's been real involved in that so we haven't had time for soccer
which is the most important thing around here pretty i mean all the little kids play soccer
they even have like a preschool soccer team
it's big in texas and i maybe all over now i don't know but
it's very big here but we didn't have that time
and so i did let her play basketball and i like it because it's indoors
yeah well she's pretty fast she's not real big but she's real fast and so
yeah
yeah but oh in the beginning you know they couldn't even make the basket and they were allowed to stand halfway forward to take that take solid shots and they couldn't even get the ball that high because they were so little and not strong enough
and then her last game just before the whistle blew they had two seconds left
she threw the ball from center court and it went right into the basket
no my son never played basketball he's grown and he he's in the band and he swam some
yeah he's a national merit student and he speaks five languages and all that so he wasn't much into sports he did play baseball for a while and he liked that
but he didn't he didn't play basketball at all
i did i played basketball in high school i loved it that and volleyball
uh-huh
yeah i love it i think it's my favorite and it's my favorite to watch
and when i was in high school i was a twirler and so
i always enjoyed that and cheerleading you know we got to do it indoors
so i always liked the basketball games better than the football games because you weren't out in the cold so
well yeah and it's easier to follow
if the ball goes in they get two points football everybody falls on top of each other and it's real difficult to say
okay
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
well that was all i could take not so much the kids as the children but because of the director
uh-huh
huh how long did she work there
gosh she must be very patient
oh great
good
hm
hm
hm
hm
nice when you have relatives that can do that
um-hum
it's
does she have kids too or
um-hum
hm
hm um-hum
so
um-hum yep
because they try your patience you know not on not on purpose but they just get into everything and
so
um-hum right
hm um-hum
uh-huh north dallas
and since that the director was really picky about kind of silly things you know nothing that really had to do with you know endangering the child or anything you know
like she didn't like the way i answered the phone or you know she didn't like this she didn't like that things that didn't have anything to do with the children so
nope huh-uh nope
okay
hm
uh-huh and they're happy with their day care centers or
oh huh
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
ooh you'd wanna be reimbursed at least
yeah
huh
uh-huh
that's good
um-hum
um-hum yep
uh-huh
oh yeah uh-huh
yes
yeah we really enjoy that too
i don't get a lot to watch a whole lot of tv we have a couple of young children and so
we're usually outside and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed we usually watch that and l a law is one of my favorites
yeah
well we have on sesame street and mister rogers that kind of stuff and i think those programs are really good for children i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there
it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually
show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world so
my older son he's going to be five and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah
oh
well yeah and you know they especially boys i mean they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff and i don't think that they really realize that death is forever you know
and showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is
no and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend i think is the hardest part you know
yeah
at least before our kids were born we used to always enjoy watching the cosby show thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as very good comedy
i like to watch designing women if the kids are in bed by then
well i did watch it just to see what it was and it wasn't really that great so i think after a while they just kind of you know there's no new stuff they can do they've done everything dirty in the book you know so
well no i imagine
everything you could think of you know had a hard time and i think maybe with dallas as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first
where i don't know i never watched knots landing but i think they've had a lot of their characters stay around
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
where you can lock up the channel or whatever
yeah
yeah
and i don't know the way the generations are up growing up now i mean i just think they watch so much more t v i try to limit what they watch they aren't sitting in the house watching t v all day
because i think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff too so
and especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings it's the only cool time to be outside
well true
well it was nice talking to you too
okay bye-bye
oh i just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere
and of course good food that's always that's always a concern but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something
just to relax you know because i don't really go out to dinner that much so
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah where you don't feel rushed you know and you can just relax and stay as long as you want and
well nearby we're almost in dallas we're just north of dallas
so we have quite a bit between us and there it's about ten miles
and there is all kinds of restaurants and
i had one that was a favorite for a long time and then it changed hands and doubled the prices and then it finally went out of business
so but it was really nice it had a fireplace and
yeah it was really nice they had entertainment sometimes and you could just really relax there and enjoy it
uh-huh
oh that's nice
uh-huh
right
that's probably very fortunate for you do you have kids
yeah
oh because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night you know and now she's graduated to two cheeseburgers so something's happened here but
you know mcdonald's is definitely at the top of her list and i hate these places
so uh-huh they do and i don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have so
so we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around and it's really it's tempting when you come home from work and you're tired and
you know you just are tempted to give in to that and it costs a lot of money to do it too you know it adds up and it's not healthy and
i really got into that habit for a while but i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy
so
is it that's what i've heard yeah
yeah have you always lived there
oh
and you like it
yeah we've been
oh yeah
uh-huh
oh that would be fun
yeah do you miss living there
no
yeah
yeah
hum
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah i go all the time
yeah well i have a twenty one year old daughter in college there and she is world champion twirler
and her coach is in california so she went there for six years
so i went out a lot with her
and yeah i know california pretty well and i love it
and we tug back and forth who's gonna move
but i think he's gonna move because i'm the person with more to lose here i have my twelve year old in school
and she's happy she's always lived here in the south and i've had my house so
i've too much to
um-hum
right
right there's there this topic is kind of moot there there's no way we couldn't survive in a in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury
one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case
every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult
right
right they shouldn't allow an appeal
yep
um-hum
no that's right i work for a law firm i ought i
right
well plea bargaining is a different story
plea bargaining is something completely different that actually prevents trials or at least speeds them up
right
right
hum
right
right
right
when you're saying as far as the appeal procedure is concerned we just have the case i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry
for cocaine possession but
well
the only thing i can i was you know the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of i like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd there's no way that could work
but
oh exactly
right
and
you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case
oh yeah i feel that everyone is everyone is entitled to a trial by jury that right
well i mean were there witnesses
right
well most of what i do is listen to the news in the morning when i'm heading to work
yeah we also subscribe to the newspaper of course so we get the washington post here and it's a pretty interesting newspaper
and so it's you know it's between the two i generally do okay every great once in a while i manage to listen to the evening news but not very often how about
yeah i don't blame you it's
yeah and it actually
well no i it's i guess what is it it's kind of a talk radio station it's run by a university here called american university or at least that the general program that i listen to national public radio itself is
a syndicated thing that's run by a group that operates here in washington but if you have any public radio stations in your area chances are pretty good
especially in austin come to think of it that you're going to be able to get it down there
yeah
well i don't know whatever your you know it the normally the public radio stations are gonna be down at the low end of the dial you know around eighty eight and so forth and
this the two radio stations that run here one is a classical station and the other i guess if you had to categorize it's kind of a bluegrass station or something
but yeah that that's i'm dead certain some station in your area carries it because every once in a while they'll do little special features on austin it's a real interesting radio program because they don't just
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
-ell that's very interesting well this comes on right in the evening as i'm driving home
and what they do is they give you about a five to ten minute news broadcast and then for the rest of the half hour they usually divide it up into two or three segments where they cover
topics either of current interest or every once in a while they'll just do kind of an indepth reporting on some particular thing like yeah like for instance how a particular city is doing or something along those lines yeah it's
sort of take a look at things from the populist point of view as opposed to being terribly sympathetic to the government although the you you've got to give them credit they do a great job of showing both sides of the story
and they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves either
which is something i really admire so if you watch the evening news which of the news commentators do you tend to like the most
yeah i'm the same way but the evening news on tv it's really it's so short that you just i don't feel like you wind up getting enough and yet have you ever watched the mcneil lehrer report on public tv
i sort of feel like that news program drags on too long
and you know with their little round table discussions and all that sort of stuff and i must admit i used to try to watch it used to make me feel like oh well this is something i should be watching
yeah exactly and
um-hum
which way which way does it lean is it conservative or
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh wow
that's good yeah
well that's
well i haven't either i hate returning things i mean i have a friend who if she likes something isn't sure what size somebody might need will buy it in every color and size and
you know take everything back again it's you know it's a game to her but i do not like to do that i consider it kind of a waste of my time and so i'm usually
pretty careful when i shop and i also you know usually have checked over things you know if it's like an appliance or something to make sure
it has the features in it that i want now we've had one lately
oh a dustbuster plus that we bought and we've had it for a while but all of a sudden it just wasn't working and
it looks like there's a part missing from it my husband opened it up and whatever and of course we don't have the receipt any more so we can't take it back but
i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
yeah
well that's true and lot of times though it is it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know if it's oh
um-hum
well yeah i think a lot of times if you get a brand name you know if it's a good brand i you i think there's there can be a lemon in anything
but i think more often than not you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time and
you know if you buy a good one you shouldn't have any you know too much of a problem with it i mean we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law
which is
extremely difficult to do we never could get it declared a lemon and the car would go and without any warning what so ever you could be going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop
and i there was just you know and oh we went round and round with the manufacturer and everything and they got it finally semifixed but it was such a hassle
yeah
yeah it really is
um-hum
well i think that's true and i now we generally don't buy a warranty because you think
you know at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
i think technology is better i'm not sure i think you've got a good point with the plastic and that i don't think necessarily that things are being made better
you know i everything is so automated and things can be made without i think a human hand ever touching it you know an awful lot of things and i think that certainly makes a difference from
back from the time when somebody hand crafted something and you know had some pride in it
well yeah that's true
yeah well i do you know craft work and sell stuff at shows and that and you know it's a real eye opener as far as you know why people charge what they do to you know
so
if i do any garden work it's only when i go home in the summer
it's about two hours north of pittsburgh
yeah
yeah we go home well we have a large family there's twelve kids in my family
so like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden
so we have a pretty good size garden
but we have like a lot like my mom likes flowers so we have a lot of flowers too
so
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
you know what i've seen a lot of people that do that
i've seen you know like elderly people that really can't get out too much and sometimes like we i have a great aunt that lives in a
it's just like a high rise for elderly people and you know she does her own thing and everything but she has it's like a little apartment building and she has a tomato plant year round
because she you know they keep it warm with for all the older people and she keeps it year round
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
pardon me
oh really
oh
and then it's done completely done
oh
um-hum
oh yeah
oh that'd be really pretty
um-hum
oh my gosh
uh-huh
that'd be funny
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
oh that'd be awful i love going out in the summer in the grass
uh-huh
yeah but well even up here at school you know it gets hot and we have the windows open well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning and just to smell the grass it's just i just love the smell of freshly cut grass
um-hum
oh my gosh
uh-huh
yeah
well you said that you had a garden what all things do you plant in it or do you like to plant in it
uh-huh
uh-huh
do you have a do your cucumbers come good
really sometimes when my dad has like that's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad he takes care of all the cucumbers
because he said the vines are just so at our house as soon as you touch a vine it's like it completely dies
uh-huh
sometimes we have really good luck with them but then there'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything
oh wow
yeah because they take up a lot
holy smoke
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my gosh
uh-huh
wow
yeah well see tomatoes grow like crazy at our house like we have a section of tomatoes and we put the tomatoes there every year in the same section and i swear we get tomatoes six rows up
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh well sometimes too when we take out our garbage and we usually you know we just dump it in the middle of the garden you know after your garden's basically done
yes
okay how do i make use of credit cards
let's see i carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because i don't ever have cash
and i do you work for texas instruments
okay well at ti we have to use what's called a texteller if we want to get cash out and those are only available at ti
so if i'm in a mall or something i can't get cash out without paying extra money so i'm always using credit cards
um-hum
um-hum yeah me too
yeah
uh-huh
but do you get to pay the bills
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh yeah
oh it's mine too yes
yeah
oh okay now did you pick this topic or were you given
i see okay
right
huh okay
let's see so how long are we supposed to talk for
okay
oh yes definitely
uh-huh
oh
that'll cost you a fortune
yes
that's right well yeah if you pay it that way it i mean it really is it's like getting a free loan for a while
which is what i do
or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in you get to keep the money
yeah it works great
okay
well it was nice to meet you
okay thanks bye-bye
okay
yeah we have one that's seventeen one that's fifteen and one that's just now six
and we had kind of a hard time finding someplace that would
we could put michael's because his birthday is the first of september and he was going to school at five
so he started the first grade when he was five or started
yeah first grade when he was five years old
yeah so we could you know we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something
and it was
mediocre expensive it wasn't really that expensive but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something
yeah
yeah well
you know
my wife works so
it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the babysitter so
okay
yeah see i don't know
yeah
and
yeah
well see we took our time and we checked it out and we found a preschool for him
and it you know through other
folks where i where i work i work at ti
so through other folks where we worked we
found a nice preschool it was actually at a licensed preschool you know we
had those requirements
so
yeah
you know i well that and
you know i don't think i would have left him anywhere that would i would have stayed home with him first
before i left him somewhere that you know they still have unlicensed babysitters running around up here and
you know i just i don't think i'd take that chance
you know i think it's out of sight or out of mind for less than
for more than a minute or so
but you never know
yeah
yeah
but you know
as far as brittle as child abuse is these days you never know
you don't know who you can trust and who you can't
you know
yeah senior care is getting real bad
yeah
so you have no children at all huh
gee
do you miss that part in your life or
yeah
yeah
i imagine yeah working in the news production anyway back to the subject
we should have discussed this earlier but anyway it's tough it really is it's hard to find
good child care and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's going to be fine all day long
and
yeah you know and he's doing real well it has paid off for him he's in first grade now and he's you know got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level
so you know those early ages when he would you know when his mom and dad are at work and he's actually in child care in a preschool not
just child care you know we could have sent him to anybody you know there's a lot people at work that would have babysat him but
sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us his attitude is i think a little bit
tall for a six year old and
you know but his
they were outside my marriage so
i don't know
i would say no but
you know all my children excel they're really good and i guess no he learns from the older boys too but
yeah
yeah seeing like in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have
another woman in the house for my wife to share but
so we faced that too but
he learns quite a bit he learned quite a bit from
not only from nursery school but he learned quite a bit from the older boys and
you know he's excelled and it's paying off for him it really is he's
he is pretty smart sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed but he is smart you know yeah
but
i think it's important i think it's really nice to know that you can
find someplace i don't know you know how it is down there in waco but in lubbock we have a few that you can
send your children to and they can actually learn something instead of just being babysat
and
no not any
huh-uh
we just
yeah they're trying to the federal government is trying to insist on that too so
no we don't yet
well it would be nice
you know there
yeah there's not well
you know where we sent michael the first few years was there was different teachers all the time you know some
girls were there in the morning and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day
you know and then he they had a group of kids and they put on skits and they put on plays and they did the halloween thing and the valentine's day things
and it's you know it was important to us so we you know we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way
no because i think
you know as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents
i don't think he needed to be attached to too even though he did
you know he attached himself to a couple of those but
i think his attachments at home and you know he gets the idea of what school is for and you know i have different teachers here and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach me another and
no so i really can't say that it would be it's important for him to attach himself to anybody
he did well you it with another child i can't say that
because i don't have that experience
yeah see
but i don't have that experience so i can't say that you know he did well so
i don't think we made too many mistakes
we tried hard
yeah he's doing real well
and he learned from it so and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be babysat all day
you know babysat sounds to me like
well you're here i guess i'll watch you when i get time you know maybe i'll clean my house maybe i'll cook you lunch maybe i won't
you know and
yeah
yeah and i don't you know i don't allow that when he's at home so
but
we had a good experience and we really did well
so and he didn't
he served
better than we did you know he gained he actually gained from it you know sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and
continue our family but i think in the long run he gained from it just
being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching tv and playing all day
and its important
yeah
yeah
yeah well
yeah
well you know his mom didn't go back to work till
you know he was six months old
and we just didn't want to dump him somewhere and make him feel like he wasn't wanted
and we wanted his center of attention at home but
we did what we could and it worked out real well i'm glad we were so careful
oh yeah you know
well it
most of the time now it's a necessity you can't afford
so
you know i'm not making seventy or eighty thousand dollars a year so
it's pretty tough
a few families outside of that where dad stayed home and mom worked but not very many that i know of when i was growing up
and you know i'm forty now but
i know when i was a kid mom was always at home
so we didn't
yeah it is yeah it is i'll agree with that it is it's not there
you know
yeah
well personally you know i think you know of course i'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package and i think that we've probably got one of the best around you know besides
yeah they tend to offer adequate vacation i guess and the paid time off is wonderful and
it's just a it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i had never really thought of it that way but i guess that's true i guess that's true i'm still young enough that the vacation's real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and that kind of thing but
you know i was just as a matter of fact i just celebrated my fifth year at ti the end of last month and
kind of started looking through the book because of that you know now that i'm a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about and
you know when you're when you're you know in your i'm only in my late twenties now so you tend not to think about retirement but it's i guess now is the time to think about it so
yeah
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
it's not gonna be build up quite enough yeah
yeah well they just they seem to make it so easy to save you know one of the things that we're doing which is probably
yeah
do you yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true that's very true
we went and did a thing through ibs which is a like a financial consultant type thing here in dallas
and one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know they work up this whole big you know proposal profile for you that all the things that you need to work on and you need to do
and then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son's education we have a two year old you know and you know we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen you know we have to do that now and
really scary and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have
you know money for his college and that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year so i guess it you know in that way at least we know that that's taken care of you know we can worry about other things so
yeah
is it really yeah
uh-huh
that's right that's right well that's what she said to us she said now do you all want him to go to a state college or a private college and
and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship
to attend you know and that was kind of our view on it just costs too much you just can't do it you know
so i don't know it's i don't it just amazing it amazes me how much the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years i just don't know how anybody's going to do it
oh goodness
yeah
yeah exactly
well you know ti you know ti offers some good stuff and then i think there's i mean i think there's some negatives but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go i have
when i came on it was great see because i had never had anything even close to what they offered so i've been real pleased
yeah
think so
um-hum
yeah
yeah and you can pick what you want and yeah
right that sounds really good i read a thing i don't even remember if it was in the dallas site or the inside one about
companies allowing you and they said that ti was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea
you know if you've been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week
then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay i'm going to want an extra five days this year and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know and they're deducting it all along so
you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know you're really not being paid for them the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know
so that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and ti said that they were looking into something like that so
um-hum
um-hum
well true
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum well and yeah and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person and
you know i see a lot of differences but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who doesn't get it you know but that's and that's that way with a lot of things you know
which is the same but then it's probably that way anywhere you know that's
um-hum
okay
saginaw
really
the we live in plano
and
they started off recycling by
putting the i think at each wal-mart they had some recycling
dumpsters and things like that which now i guess the city has bought these
big green trash cans and
we they have a recycling truck that comes around now
and you separate your glass and
paper
and aluminum
and you set it out and they pick it up and it works real neat they seem to be having a real good response
but
did they
did they like on bottles did they give you a
so many cents back for
for cans even i've seen that
really
no i've just i noticed in iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel
per aluminum can
so you don't see too many thrown out around the streets
even bottles you know all kinds of bottles they
they really charge people to i guess when you purchase them and then when you turn them back in
i know i remember the old days as a kid where
a bottle was a nickel
right so maybe that's one thing they could do to
um-hum
well that's
right
that was my brother's first job in a grocery store he was in the bottle area
it's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over but it's
it's quite they say that the green glass now that there's a big glut
of green
the green glass yeah it's amazing
uh-huh
right yeah it's i notice the plastics have sort of
faded away the milk jugs it it's
people just they really don't there's too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff
collecting you know clean junk as they say
well i think i think two or three minutes is fine yeah
right
oh we're doing it for a church choir so
only for fun
i really enjoy it though
so let's see what do i do in the winter i play volleyball
well i must admit that utah has the best snow on earth
yeah it you know i do it for the fun i can't stand
say stationary bicycle
gets pretty boring or
like
you know lifting weights because i can't count more than to three before i get bored and then i lose track of the repetitions
but the
you know the gym's open say for volleyball on every wednesday so that's regular
yeah
so you must be over twenty then
yeah when you're about when you're under twenty five you can pretty much get away with doing nothing and then when you want to get do something athletic you just get up and do it
otherwise i find you've got to go every week
everyday
if you want to have any sort of shape
running that doesn't bother your knees at all
great
well it's hard to get no exercise while running i mean you pretty much got to move don't you
well even just walking
well but you know like say riding a bike where if you go really slow it's pretty much coasting you're not even doing anything
and just to move while running you've got to move your legs every single step
so you don't you don't feel you're getting a good exercise when you go out jogging
oh okay
all right yeah it's not supposed to hurt i just find that it really pounds
because i'm in particular running
no
no that's i and i'd like to because i think it'd be fun
i run in connection with you know in case i accidentally play basketball or
so you know football you know something there's all sorts of activities where you end up running
it's just
sort of a natural thing
but i don't do it just for the sake of running
yeah you know swimming is something i've gotten to the point where i action actually can do laps now
that used to bore me to tears you know i'd love to swim if it was water polo or
you know splashing about or
you know if there was some diversion
just but that's good exercise
yeah i'm looking forward to that it's i can
yeah see that gets back to this lack of discipline and training i would never join a team because they'd want you to do these repetitions or something
rather than let just play the game
stationed in england right now and of course you know they've had group health over there for some time
i was over there a year ago when my granddaughter was born
they don't have and their medical technology the doctors since they aren't responsible really to each patient don't feel they have to sit down and talk to you about the problems
when they want to do something to a patient whether the patient is a few days old or eighty or ninety they do it they don't ask permission
my daughter went upstairs into intensive care to see the baby and they were doing surgery on the baby and she didn't even know they were going to do surgery on the baby
yes it was it was really terrible that's why i went over there i mean she was she cried she called and was you know really you know upset the day we were leaving the hospital finally
we were getting all ready to go home and finally you know the baby was okay and everything was fine and the doctor that had been working with her poked his head in the door and he said by the way he said in six weeks he want you to come back
for a test that we want to do on her for
multiple sclerosis
and he turned around and left
and we just kind of looked at each other and said what
for what and i tried for fifteen minutes to find the doctor and he was unavailable
so i've had some bad experiences with it i perhaps not you know i don't know a good solution do you have any ideas
you only get a choice of doctors that are in your area not necessarily of doctors that are good or not see i i've worked for i worked for johns hopkins for two years
at the hospital there and i've worked for a private doctor for two years and
i got to slap in the face as far as the medical profession was concerned in the united states now the doctor that i worked for was good but there was another one in our complex that she didn't feel should even be practicing medicine and i said well why don't they
get him out of there she said well he hasn't done anything wrong it's just that he has poor judgment and i thought oh gosh i mean you're the doctor telling you this you know
some horror stories like that but then when with the hmo the they sent her to a pediatrician that had one gentleman that was
in his late seventies
and an indian doctor that she couldn't understand and that had no patience with children
and you know it was kind of that was kind of a bad experience too so when they changed she finally got
you know a good pediatrician but it it's
it's just a little scary when you don't have as much when you can't just go say hey here's a good doctor i'm going to go to this doctor you know
i don't know i just fear that it may go downhill if we do indeed you know change to something like that
no it doesn't also
we my husband was a civilian but we were stationed overseas for a while and so i had to go to
same thing i mean these doctors didn't want to be here okay they were forfilling fulfilling their military obligations and you know they of course i guess if you a doctor gets into the field you know they
well enjoy the field but i have found
through people that i know that have hmo's that most of the doctors that they see there may be one or two good ones and the rest of them are either foreign speaking
i mean not speaking but like indian doctors you can't understand them because of their accent
or chinese or and i have nothing against them in fact i went to a doctor for years that was a chinese doctor but i could understand what he was saying
right well i'll tell you now what you do
is you go to the doctors and just meet them
and get feel on you know you can usually tell if you go to a doctor and if you give him
i don't know some ache or pain or just how they you know reply if they're going to be good or not the doctor that will sit down and talk to you and that will you know do things like that
is
is usually pretty good but you know i'd try him out
yeah oh it okay see that's it
yeah so that's see that's what scares me about going into universal health
you know and that would be closest to where you live and you know those are the ones that you would see i mean i would presume
but also now in england how they work it is you go to see a regular md
if he determines that it's necessary then he'll send you to a gynecologist or a surgeon or you know you can't just go there
yes
um-hum
yep
hum
that's right and i mean you know that could potentially be
rather
it's kind of overcast you know just it's hot and the sun is trying tries to shine through but it it's holding in this pollution and i think so and we have
pasadena texas which is sort of between here you know heading toward galveston i mean it's still part it's part of the houston
well i think it's industry and i think it's cars
i don't i well maybe not but it sure it sure you know it i know that when i'm when i'm behind a car and sometimes
i can really smell especially diesel and things like that you know comes right in
to my air conditioner and you know my head and my i'm so stopped up right now i don't know if it's if it's partly from what's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that that's part of it but
um-hum
um-hum
you mean fifty percent pollution total from that comes from
oh uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
right
do y'all have pollution in your part of the country from industry
really like what any particular kind or just all kinds
hum
um-hum
um-hum
well what can we do about the air conditioning problem
um-hum
is that also what's in aerosol
even so the aerosol is still aerosol but it doesn't have anything that's damaging
um-hum well that's good
here they've just started doing that it's you know you're not you don't have to but you know i know i am i save
no kidding
you really oh
is that right
well we need to do something we need to get serious about it
um-hum
um-hum
i have too
um-hum
somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway i think they got caught but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff you know goes on
we have to we have to have a state inspection every year do y'all have that so which i would
but that's all they check for they don't check how good if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough or
we do that every year
well i'll have to check i'm not sure if our state inspection once a year has to do you know if they check the
um-hum
but a lot of these some of this well you know a lot of people have well water in fact in this area too and you know and
if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what your what your drinking on i know a lot of people you know have that and you know you have to wonder if that you know it could have an adverse effect on them too if they don't if they don't get it checked
um-hum
when we were when i was growing up i lived in huntsville alabama and their water supply came from
spring and it was like ice cold spring water and i guess parts of the city still you know get that but that was that was really wonderful it was really good
well too many kids and i think too many infections and things coming in
yeah sicknesses and i don't know then all the things you hear about them
yeah i mean i'm sure there's some good ones but i just i don't think that i would hum
oh uh-huh
oh yeah how was it
oh
she went
oh she did
wrapping her arm all the way yeah
oh
uh-huh
well they'd never picked it out though huh or just never said anything
yeah
yeah
well i think it's hard to leave them it is
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
huh
uh-huh or is everything okay
it it's on your favorite tv shows and why
i love it i think it promotes good family values and it's funny
that's yeah
what kind do you like to watch
wonder years
i like both of those real much also i think basically they same thing they promote family values
watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me and
yeah which i just i always felt was wonderful and so many of them nowadays like i said i think are just
yes
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i agree do you like the sports programming
i enjoy those also almost as much to a certain extent i'm our whole house is baseball fans and we enjoy that and
oh yeah
oh yeah they're
probably the pirates
annoyed that the rangers got rid of him and i'd
like to see him do well laugh all the way to the bank i guess
pardon
live in plano
um-hum
um-hum
well yeah it's
um-hum
i like things that
are wholesome i guess
um-hum
yes
um-hum
yeah
oh okay
well you're in quite a interesting city for crime drugs and all kinds of things that we hear about aren't you
oh i see uh-huh
uh-huh i see
yeah
well it's each city i guess has its own specific type of difficulty
oh there's a lot of homicides in dallas that seems to be
well a lot of it is drug related but i think that there is just an excessive homicide rate and an excessive amount of arms bearing you know personal arms bearing
um-hum
oh i see um-hum
know exactly what that brings about you know the appeals and things like that as far as the people being retrialed and maybe get an alleviated sentence
it does seem though that the jail capacities are stretching to the fullest and
um-hum
um-hum
oh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum that's right
uh-huh
that's right i believe that
um-hum
oh my in the parking lot oh yes uh-huh
it's very difficult to know what the answer is and along with that there's a lot of poverty a lot of homeless and
and a lot of i guess discrimination is still around and
um-hum
uh-huh
oh
oh i didn't know that
oh that's very strange
well i don't really like that very much
what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff
oh
oh yeah um-hum
that's not really good i don't know i guess that's an invasion of privacy i'm not sure that that's an everyday thing though at least not for you know an individual
something that i feel is a is a pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now is the open office concept
uh-huh where they have the you know the little partition dividers throughout a large room and people have little cubicles well that's all fine and good but you don't really have any privacy at all
right
yeah
and it's not it's not just that it's the whole thing about you know if you're trying to concentrate well it's rather hard sometimes it's almost impossible to do
because
you know you're time
and you're space is not your own space
and i've work in a situation like that and i
well kind of have a problem with that
oh yeah is there anybody who doesn't
yeah
hm
yes
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i don't i don't think that's quite right either
yeah
hm
what do you think could be done about it
yeah
it really is it's something that something that i've just had a
a dealing with is like a credit bureau
well they take they take my name which is a very common name and my last name is even more common
and they check that name against their list and they find several
and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name
they don't they don't even check my social security number
and companies are paying them good money to report accurately and they're not they're so lazy they're just not doing it i mean they just find your name and they match it up
you know and that just drives me crazy because they're and then they want then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this
write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them you know and then it takes three weeks and all and i'm like baloney
you messed it up you fix it
no what i've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report
like recently i was reported as having jc penney accounts and i don't
so i called jc penney and i said i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you're providing to them
and they say uh-huh because they really don't want to pay for services that's not being done properly either so then they can call
the credit bureau and say hey you know we're paying you good money to report this properly and you're not doing your job
so that's what i've taken to doing lately and it seems to work pretty well so far
not that i can think of
yes
oh yeah probably better let you get back to work
okay
alrighty bye-bye
okay credit cards they leave a bad taste in my mouth
yeah
yeah
well the thing i hate about them i went through a divorce
and i will never own another joint credit card
because even if in the divorce decree one is agrees to pay it
if you're a cosigner on it they'll still come after you
if the other person doesn't
and boy that that's a rotten deal
yeah
yeah
about twenty thousand dollars worth
i can't imagine anybody letting somebody charge that much on a credit card
but they call me i sent them a copy of the divorce decree and told them i refuse to pay it
and
yeah
and they said well i'm sorry even though the card is in her name you you're a cosigner on it
and i threatened you know legal action and everything i don't know i've sent them a letter and i said i want this removed from my credit
rating and haven't heard anything back but i haven't run a credit check either
yeah
yeah
but
that's i'll never own another joint
credit card
yeah
yeah
and i also found out something else for your information and i don't know if you're married or not
but one of the credit cards the account was paid off
oh it was paid off for a couple of years never even used it
and then all of a sudden i got a phone call from them saying she's behind in her payments and i said well i don't care she's my ex-wife
and they said well your name is still on file as cosigner
so even dormant
credit cards you have
you have to go and send them a copy and tell them you're not responsible for any bills
but it can turn into a mess
yeah it was inactive and i never sent them a copy of the divorce decree or anything because they wasn't even mentioned in the divorce decree as to which party would pay what
because the
credit card was zero it was you know don't and it was dormant
that's right
yeah
either that or make or each party have their own credit card not a joint
yeah
yeah
yeah he would have been stuck with everything
yeah
about the only credit cards i have now are gas cards
but they're in my name only
yeah
little yeah
yeah and you'll get letters in the mail where they want to increase your credit line
and
and it also makes it bad because you can't deduct that interest now
you know at least you used to get some relief by being able to deduct all that interest and finance charges
can't even do that anymore
yeah
well you this last year was ten percent
this next time it's zero
yeah
yeah about the only interest you can deduct now are is a house payment mortgage interest and
and taxes
but
credit cards you can
uh-huh
yeah
right
right
no homesteaded
in texas
you get a
a big tax break if you
call what they homestead it you have to sign a piece of paper that says this is my primary residence and i live here
oh
yeah
huh
yeah
that's crazy
oh that's so
yeah
at least now
they're talking
about instituting a state income tax
everything else that would bring in money the
the people want it but the or texas
state congress and so forth won't pass a bill to do it like a lottery
seventy percent of the population voted wanted a lottery
and yet the house voted it down the texas house voted it down
they all they want to do is increase property taxes and
put a income tax in
it makes you
right it makes you pay it
i do have an american express but i got it through ti
it's a it's a yeah it's a
yeah it's a corporate
yeah
yeah and if you're late on this on my american express they write ti
since it's a corporate american express
and if you don't pay it you get a call from your supervisor saying why hasn't this been paid
so you don't dare run up anything on it that you can't you know that you can't pay that's the problem with credit cards it it's
people don't think of it as cash
they think of it like monopoly money that hey i can just charge this and
pay it wherever i feel like it
yeah
right
yeah
huh
well i guess we've been i'm surprised they hadn't beeped in and said your ten minutes is up
they've been even before ten minutes here lately they've been saying
you should cut it off
well listen i've enjoyed talking with you
yeah something about the school system here
yeah
what school system does she teach in
oh wow
well i think it's more of a there's a bigger problem here than
than discipline in the schools i think it gets back to the parental participation into the program
to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the garland school district and it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school
because they've taken it the best teachers and the best students they've taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district
and put them in this academy system and to get into the system's very difficult but once you're in they have they have self-paced programs
and so you have students that wanna learn and you have teachers that wanna teach and you have parents that are really interested in the children and basically
are caucasian and because you have to test into the system
and most of that's not all true but i'm saying a large percentage of them are and also the other large percentage is that all the parents just about of these kids have college degrees at least one parent does
and so there's i think that that's my justification for saying that
the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're saying do your homework let me see it
yeah
yeah i think what we've done is especially looking at the south dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education
level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed
and that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're not don't have the proper education
including
exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do
database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job you can't function
you know so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says we're not going to pay you
unless you have the education and then and then we what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself
yeah something about returning goods and if they're getting any better than they used to be
and i was worried that might cause me a problem but so far it looks like it has been a good deal
uh-huh
uh-huh
do you buy do you buy much mail order
do you buy much mail order
uh-huh have you had any problems with that at all
oh uh-huh
oh yeah
well some places are good about sending them out by ups or other ways but
try to do my homework to find which brand i think is probably going to be the best thing and generally i am you know pretty well happy with it afterwards sometimes you may find it on sale elsewhere but
maybe it's the kind of shopper determines what kind of goods you get know what i'm saying
uh-huh
oh
trying to give you some kind of concession there
i'm trying to think what the last thing was that i turned in or wanted to take back
i bought some clothing i don't know if you get these lands' end catalogs
they make mail order clothing and most of it's very good i bought five or ten shirts i would guess over the course of oh probably four or five years
and they've been very good with the exception of one that had the button hole kind of pulled away from the front of it
and
no they're real good in fact i've had the shirt for actually i probably had it for over a year
and the only reason i called them on it is because i'd had similar shirts that held up for several years
and they said regardless that you've you know worn it for a year or over a year we'll take it back and give you a new one
huh
yeah
right
if you want repeat business which a lot of those retailers do you've got to really bend over backwards to treat the customer and make him feel like they have occasion to go back and wanna go back
you know that's like i've seen on this mail order if they were skin flints about it and wouldn't take it back
i mean they depend on that kind of a reputation so much
oh yeah this they're sporting aren't they uh-huh
yeah
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh you haven't had any problems with it though huh
uh-huh
yes i have one
yeah i do i do i work and brian's in a day care center he's he was two in december so he's not quite two and a half yet and he i put him i'm
kind of had different ideas from what probably the majority of people have i put him in a day care center from the very beginning he started in day care when he was eight weeks old
and i just i don't know i have kind of the opposite opinion of most people i have had this real problem with a with a private individual i mean i kind of looked at it like
if you take him to a home with a with private individual when the door shuts
that one person has total control you know and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around and if you get one bad apple there's are at least other people that can see it they can watch and i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less
you know how can you help depending on the day care center you know you got to
when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it you know kind of thing i mean it's a
yeah you never hear about it really in the big ones so that's what i did and i have had just excellent luck i have been just so happy he's
right well he was in he was in the same center for two years for the first two years and it was wonderful and i loved it and i was so happy there and the woman who owned it sold it
but i thought okay i'm going to keep an open mind here and the new people that came in it just wasn't it just wasn't the same and their attitude and philosophy was just completely opposite from mine and i
how about you do you work or do you get to stay home with them
wonderful
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
he didn't leave the baby yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right did you have them in a center or something last summer
yeah that stuff is expensive it really is
are these yeah i was going to say they're getting to the age where you can you can kind of trust that a little bit yeah
uh-huh
to find the right one that's what we have to do though
but
no
where do where do you live
plano okay
oh that's wonderful
that's great
right
uh-huh i've heard that they were very good
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
poor kid was in school all day yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh even at that age they need that time we all need that time
just some quiet time to wind down from the day
you could hardly wait i mean he's so much fun now he's really he's really starting to get lots of fun and i can't wait until stuff like that starts happening you know and you know we did the easter egg hunts which was really the first year he was really able to
excited to get there in the morning and just doesn't even want to kiss me good-bye it's just like bye and he goes running you know and he's always having fun when i pick him up so you know yeah this day care is
this woman owns three day cares two in lewisville and one in irving and she had to open the second one up in lewisville because her waiting list was just like
you know like a year old it was ridiculous and she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other you know so its i mean she's
she knows what she's doing all the teachers like about half the teachers are degreed teachers and oh it makes a huge difference
uh-huh
yeah
that's right that's right
that's right and his old day care as much as i loved it you know and the owner i really liked her and she worked really hard to get good people but the people that she got
were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else you know and i got lucky and all of his teachers were very good
yeah but then sometimes you know
yeah
it just went up the first of this month i'm paying seventy nine dollars a week for now
so it's a little high but it's you know like it's where he was before i was only paying sixty three so i mean there was there's quite a little jump there but you know i looked all over louisville
i looked in every day care there was in louisville and you know and there were places that were cheaper but is it
you know your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money you know and i have peace of mind where he is and some of those other places i wouldn't have
yeah
uh-huh
well i just got back from taking my little girl to her brownie meeting and then we had this whole can a bag filled full of cans and they've been recycling at their school well she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow
but they were filled with beer cans and i hated to take a big old sack i mean we're talking you know like a lawn bag full of them like i no we'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway
they get tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans and i think that's all
oh
okay and they're taking the money that they earn to plant trees
yeah and they've got those bins that just stay there and they decorated them real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff
so they're getting into it i don't know what they get for the tickets though
what do you get for the tickets
if you bring stuff
oh the class i guess gets the most tickets gets a party
so that's not bad yeah
um-hum
so in each of the dorms you have a place for that
ah that's really good
so
hm
for the dorm and who decides what you do with it
and what do they do with it
uh-huh
well
i graduated from college in nineteen seventy two
and we were just not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle anything of course you just threw it away
so a little different and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through target to recycle i had my school do it
but my principal said since we're doing this thing called operation desert shield we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all this
for the whole school you know it was just this big project she didn't want to get into that and i could do it in the center and i just never got around to it
but it's like a club you know about that
there was a little boy that had died of leukemia i think and he was had started this save the environment club
and his mother is carrying this on and you can get the information to set it up you know or join you don't have to join it as a group or anything i don't guess but you could start your own anyway get a pamphlet
um-hum
do y'all have target stores up there
no
that's a department store
kind of like k mart except it's a little better than what k mart sells i think
we
so you're not you're not having it picked up at your houses or anything yet
huh
now in some of the towns around us they're already picking up the newspapers
well they're doing that here too now that i think about it
once every so many weeks and you have to pull out all the slicks and you have to wrap them up with string
and
i think that's all they're picking up but you know like in minnesota they've got those bins where you put your plastics and your bottles
yeah because my brother-in-law lives in minnesota and they're just nice plastic bins and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash and they pick them up
so
do y'all have can banks
no
it's just a big old bin and you just feed your cans slowly in through slot and your money comes out you know every once in a while for however much poundage you've got and you keep feeding it till the light goes off
and you get instant cash but they had one that i was putting my stuff in and i went to take some today and it was gone
but they don't give you for the other
well that
uh-huh well they're certain places you know where i know you can take your leaded cans but i don't know where they are they publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it
but
me too if they would oh i know we're saving
our grocery bags now
yeah they're taking those up you can take them to the stores
like kroger's doing it
and i think skaggs do you have those up there
and we they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic coke bottles there too
so
pretty good isn't it
it sounds like it you'd think you would be
you mean where you sack your own groceries
but you know they do that like i went to europe nineteen seventy three
and every you know they go all the time i mean it's like they would go almost everyday to the store and they had their little bags way back then and fill it up and they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators
that's why i mean they couldn't put anything in it hardly
but
well what are you going to be when you get out of college
here in texas it's a real mess right now
oh definitely there's no let's see we've had the funding we've run out of money we've frozen the money
right and they had until the fifteenth of april to come up some formula that would be more equitable to different districts according to finances because the poor districts were getting less money so
not as good an education right
and now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that i'm in dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable
and if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth then the state's supposed to decide the courts
i think they're gonna maybe give us a state income tax do you have one
i mean
and i don't know
it doesn't seem like it would work to take it away when we're using it but maybe i know we're not using it so wisely
we have too many administrators
in some of these big districts but other than that well can you think of anything else we need to talk about
me either anything else
what about people from pennsylvania what do they think about texans
um-hum
probably a lot more civilized more refined than a lot of the people would be down here
there's some
no
well i've never let's see i think i have too been to pennsylvania
gettysburg
yeah we went up there
now that i think about it on one of our long trips we take off on
she'd be big i don't know what are you saying holly
oh my little girl is in the second grade and told me to tell you that shboom means good-bye in the israeli language
israel is what you say it is holly israel in israel see she's got this little girl from israel in her classroom that she's befriended
so she's into this
huh-uh you know we've had a lot of the jewish people
well why don't you start because you've had more time to think about it if you don't mind
you know i when i was much younger than i am now i had wanted to go to the peace corps
and
seems like i it was something that i really wanted to do
seems like wanting to go to the peace corps was something that i had really wanted to do when i was young
but i don't believe they accept you after you know after you're married and you have kids and all that so i got into that and i wasn't able to
to participate
oh they will
oh i didn't know that
then there's no age limit
your kidding
goodness i'm surprised i really had no idea
well
i don't i don't really think that they should be it should be mandatory i mean
well
i don't know i it's that just might not be something that everybody wants to do i mean there are a lot of people who would like to do it and there are a lot of people who get into other things and they get all involved and they just
you know
don't want to or don't have the time
i don't see how that can
make a better class of americans to make everybody
to make it mandatory for everybody to participate
that's true
well
i don't i don't think that
yeah are you suggesting then that if i have to go and do something for the country for two years
that the country will compensate me in some way
i will be compensated for this i'm not just going to
okay
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
thousands and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs
no
i'm not familiar with that
oh i
um-hum
i see
and that was
in trade for
some okay
um-hum
um-hum
well then i guess there are a lot of a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country
um-hum
i really don't see anything wrong with it i just don't think that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that
well
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
all right i wonder if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering to do it that it you know that they would have enough
i mean i
i probably
um-hum
uh-huh
oh well yes we have with
without working in the traditional american
job market
right
so what i'm saying they get the money anyway they can
yeah
okay
um-hum
well i think that's a you know valid observation that anytime that a company that a country appears to be moving in the same direction that the united states
thinks is the right direction that they tend to get more you know more aid from our government then they would have before or the other governments do
i suppose that's a
as valid a way of determining who gets aid is as anything although i'm not sure that
us giving aid is the right thing for our government to be doing
i think it's kind of ironic that
from my you know from my observation anyway that we're rewarding other governments for becoming more democratic in following more capitalistic approaches
whereas in our own economy the trend seems to be more towards social programs
and you know away from the capitalistic approach so it's kind of like you know we're moving in the in a kind of a direction toward each other
you know i mean that's my own observation anyway
right
right yeah
right
yeah
and i'm not sure that i would even think at this point that somewhere in the middle would even be desirable because i mean if there's if there's something
if what we wind up with is more socialistic than what we have now
then i'm not sure that it's the right thing it's there i think we have too much too many social programs
it's a social programs without the corresponding responsibility
i guess is
um-hum
right
um-hum
right oh i
i noticed in an article in the paper where i didn't read the whole article but you know the headlines anyway indicated that there's a seems to be a consensus among small and medium size business owners
that the output of the american worker is on the decline you know pretty severely but
the output's really suffering and i think that's
you know that's another indication that
that we're headed in the wrong direction
you know and i think i think rewards for a job well done are
i guess we have a tendency to
as you know as managers of companies or owners of companies they have a tendency to try to get as much out of the employee
as they can
and not give as much as they can
you know in return i
i think that there needs to be some give and take in both you know on both sides of the
of the picture there
right
right
and i was going into the public library and apparently the accident had just you know recently happened then but there was a policeman there policewoman there
taking down the information and i was in the library a good thirty minutes and came back out and she was still sitting in the police car there you know the accident
participants were gone but she was sitting there filling out paperwork you know so you know it took her thirty minutes plus to handle one traffic accident
right
and you know i think that's just a kind of an indication the paperwork the amount of information that the government wants
even about a traffic accident you know is so much that
you know we get bogged down and things like that
yeah
correct yeah
okay well that just sounds like i got another phone call trying to come in so anyway it's been interesting thank you
bye
i think i get most of my news in headlines from the radio and then i follow up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i think c n does a pretty good job i had not watched them very much except when i was abroad until the gulf war
and they seemed to have the best coverage they had more information sooner than most of the other networks
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah we have a c b s twenty four hour station that i listen to on the way to and from work and
northern i'm from the peninsula palo alto
well it's horrible the san francisco paper is just wretched
so i subscribe to the san jose mercury news palo alto is about midway between well it's a whole lot better than that san francisco paper and
yeah there's the chronicle and the examiner but they're both run by the same
they're just horrid so we read the
we can but i don't like it so we subscribe to the new york times and the wall street journal and the mercury news
um-hum
yes and i think we do get pretty good coverage i don't feel that the american people is being shortchanged by the news coverage
we almost have too much
well i cannot stand dan rather i remember him when he was a local newscaster in houston and i hated him then
i watch peter jennings and tom brokaw sort of alternate
do we get enough news or something like that do we get the do we get the news that we want and i do i really think
yeah
okay well nice to talk to you bye
you can start
so i'd think it's more than that actually
i think i it's funny you mentioned new york first because that's where i live in new york city i think they had two thousand murders last year so that's like six a day
it's a little different in the city sometimes you know that's
i you know that that's the problem with guns in new york and
sure yeah
that's right that was in minneapolis wasn't it oh
oh milwaukee okay
sure
sure it's weird it's it crime is a weird thing too as far as like the people that perceive it as a problem and the actuality of it because like i live in new york city
yeah currently we have a poodle
yeah
it's a miniature
yeah
well i wouldn't i definitely wouldn't dispute that it's actually my wife's dog i became part owner six months ago when we got married but
it definitely responds to authority and i've had dogs in the past and
well about a year i guess
it just turned two i believe
pretty much yeah
okay
oh that sounds interesting
oh that's neat how about how big then
okay
yeah
most definitely
yeah
oh i wouldn't doubt it yeah
well that's understandable yeah that's
uh-huh
okay
oh
yeah
okay
i see
yeah definitely
yeah i can honestly say we do we just recently put a security system in our house and so now in order to
to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her locked up in the master bedroom during the day and then she's got the bedroom and the bathroom to for free run during the day but
we've always got a got a nose and a tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door she's definitely ready to get out and run around
really
oh wow
yeah
okay
okay
okay
most definitely
yeah the yeah that's a that's a definite security involved in a dog like that
um-hum
wow that's
yeah that's interesting
yeah i know our dog has had some different reactions she's never really been around children and
if the child is pretty straight forward she's fine if a child is a little intimidated she'll jump around and yip and bark quite a bit and if the child gets scared
she's still trying to play but she doesn't completely understand what's going on and we've had a little confusion with younger kids
but you know that's it's a matter of exposure really we took her home to my family's place in south dakota
and she was the one that was intimidated then there was about seven kids ranging from about
three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit grandpa and grandma and the dog kind of felt out of place then because she was she was being fed and everything else from all directions she really didn't know how to handle herself so
she really did she just she was she was just inundated with all the attention she kind of she kind of sat and soaked it all in for a little while and then she'd go get back in and try to play and whatnot but
it was it was just such a new experience for her she's only been around one and sometimes two people at the most so
pardon
oh it's mitzi
yeah
oh okay
yeah
i see
yeah
yeah i had i had a similar experience i grew up on a farm so i always had outdoor pets
and the dog i had when i moved to dallas about five years ago was a springer spaniel black lab cross
and he was a real a real lovable type but definitely not an apartment type animal so he had to stay home
yeah it really was it he apparently had a tough time with it for a little while then he got he came to accept the fact that mom and dad were his company from then on but
yeah
okay
most definitely
well that's great
that sounds real good
you too bye
no i mean i'm not my employer does not do that although
i had an ex-employer that the previous job i used to have they've after i guess a few years after i'd started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
i don't know my feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb if should somebody be under the influence of drugs
well
in that regard where there's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property i i'd i would seriously question it
so
so it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent
yeah
well
huh
right and
yeah i agree i mean it's
kind of a coarse kind of test
is that done right
now let me ask you this
at the time you hired on with this company was that prior to any
yeah
well
we take the rent first
you know we need to have a roof over our head
and then we take the car
you know we need a car to get back and forth to work
and then it's the utilities
and then the food
and then the regular bills
you know your credit cards and your
yeah
i i'm trying to think what else phone the utilities come last or before let's see the utilities come before the food and the bills
the credit card you know the credit cards and what else is there that we pay you know we got loans
things like that they come before the they come after everything else
they're last on it because you know they
they're never late but they're the least bothersome to us you know we need a roof and all that before we need anything else
yeah
yeah
yeah well i'm a homemaker myself so he brings home the money and we just divvy it up the way it
should be and
or the way whatever way we can
i can imagine i you know i haven't gone through a divorce myself i've only been married once but
i know a lot of people that have and a lot of them's got alimony and child support and all that
yeah i bet
well that's better than having them living with you
yeah i bet you do
yeah oh well me and my
yeah
i've got one of them
yeah
but it runs on car batteries and you know stick it in the lighter and runs on regular batteries and electricity
so it's a neat little thing to have
well they we have direct deposit that helps a lot
and
first thing he does is we get out our clipboard we got everything on a clipboard from now for three months ahead
and you know he makes the same amount every week
he's not it's not salary he gets paid by the hour but we know exactly to the penny how much he's going to get unless he works over and then it's
you know that's extra but
he's got us situated to where we pay two or three of the big ones at the beginning of the month and then all the little ones at the middle of the month
and none of them's ever been late you know the ones that come in the middle of the month are early you know we pay them like two weeks ahead of time and
it works out real well
most problem we had was when
let's see when was it
something like we had a three weekends
you know it was a late the long pay period
and we was close to being
oh shoot i'm trying to think it's been so long it was when he was in the military and
it was something like four weeks in between pay periods and it really blew everything away
we was close to being late on a lot of stuff
and so that was pretty bad but
i don't know i like that he's got it mapped out in the on the clipboard
yeah
yeah pretty much
with the direct deposit that's what helps you know because he doesn't have the money in hand
oh well he's we got that atm machine and that and his bank is right there at his work
and you know how they got the that texans credit union
right there he
he's good at getting into that but he's you know we never in my i've been married to him for seven years and we've never had a check bounce
and well no i take that back one time we did
so
yeah
yeah that's what's going to hurt us in april we owe on our taxes and that will hurt
and yeah that's taking money that we didn't have you know that we had set aside for a bill or two and we're trying to finagle now getting ready for it because we got to pay them by april
yeah
yeah
well i know how it is to start out with nothing you know
and i'm we're up to where
close to where we want to be but we're not quite there yet
yeah i just i just think that i it would help a lot if i got a job
but then
i'd rather be with my kids
yeah well you know i've got a two year old and a four year old and
yeah but i know it would help with the bills
yeah
okay well it was nice talking to you
all right bye-bye
yes
yeah
something like twenty two or twenty three i remember reading that and being horrified
had she had any previous criminal history now that's the of thing i'd have to kind of look at
in texas if you're going to sentence somebody to death what is there a specific criteria that they have to meet
if you were on a jury would you be able to give somebody a death sentence
um-hum
as long as your armed over the history of a violent crime
yeah
yeah see i come from a catholic church background too
and always thought you know that being raised in the midwest you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than shoplifting
and it was very easy to maintain this stand that you know that life is something that you have no right to take
there was a oh what was his gary gilmore
did you ever read the book that norman mailer wrote the executioners song
gary gilmore was the one who was arrested and found guilty of i think two or three murders in utah outside of provo and he was the one that was petitioning to have you know himself executed
when you read his book with all the interviews this guy did with gary gilmore you know it sounds like the guy had about every turn
given to him every rehab opportunity given to him and even interviews with his mother she said that you know as a small child he's basically was amoral
and when i finished that book i kind of thought you know what do you how do with a person like this
see i would i always come look at it do they have could they be put you know even in life imprisonment could they be put to useful labor
and then what do you do about the thing that you know the was it one tenth of one percent chance that they might have been convicted erroneously
have you ever sat on a jury
either have i and i'm one of these people who votes regularly and i'm always registered wherever i've lived and i have never been called
part of me says that i'd kind of like to do it just to see what it's like to be in that position where you are playing you know life and death with somebody else could i bring myself to do it
yeah have you ever lived in a in a well but dallas is i'm is are you calling from dallas
okay have you have you ever been a victim of a crime
you know when we lived in boston i had eleven cars stolen
yeah some of them i had for two days and you'd go to court and you'd see these kids and then
what they did is they usually hired kids to do this because you would get a you know a lighter sentence or no sentence or probation or you know something trivial and it'd be the same damn kids
over and over and over again and the first couple of times you know i felt really sorry for them but after a while it was like you know shoot the little shits right then and there and then i felt really you know guilty about feeling that way
yeah i you know i really don't know what i would do in that situation if i had to make that judgment i think i would i think i'd be very easily swayed by fellow jurors
boy if they ever catch this guy in richardson and coppell who's been you know abducting the young girls i don't think i'd even hesitate
and then you know what do you do with you know people that are you know chronic child molesters
where even a psychiatrist says
you're probably not going to change them they're always going to be you know at risk in society and i think you know having kids has probably really
changed you know my thinking on this i don't know i really don't know
yeah but the code of ethics that's learned in prison is so bent and twisted that you wonder when they get out of there even if they you know claim that they're are rehabbed
they don't even have social skills
oh i don't know i really don't know i think that if somebody asked me i would hesitantly say yes that i could hand down a death sentence
then the big you know my big problem would be is what if you were in a in a state that absolutely did not allow it
and you were on a jury with some heinous you know criminal who had you know just wiped out an entire family
or parole in fifteen twenty years
just outside of dallas
yeah
okeydoke well punch one we'll get started
-kay i guess my favorite eating out food is mexican food
tex-mex not real mexican food
hum
huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah well i like a i like a restaurant that
not necessarily for atmosphere you know the atmosphere isn't worth a dime if the food's no good and the service is lousy
and this little old mexican restaurant we have right up here from the house i don't guess it'll hold more than twenty people
and the service is excellent and the price is very reasonable
it's not a chain it's a little a family owned restaurant
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
yeah plus you can go in after you've
you've gone to the place quite a few times they get to know you and you know appreciate you and say hello to you and how are you doing and
and all you got to do is sit down and say we'll have our usual
and you know it's just it's real nice and
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
plus you go you go to a big fancy restaurant and
some of the price that you pay for the meal is strictly for the decor and for the atmosphere and you can't eat that
yeah
yeah
yeah
and i guess it depends you know if it's just you and your husband going out to eat unless it's anniversary or something like that atmosphere doesn't mean that much but if you're taking another couple or taking
relatives or friends or something you want the place you know to be nice
but and also we
i wasn't too much on chinese food until i tried it and i really liked it
and i even bought me a wok and doing my own doing my own chinese cooking now but
uh-huh yeah we've tried it a couple times and even had relatives over and i cooked some out of that and boy they just lapped it up
but
pounded not hand carved hound hand made of iron
it's not one of these aluminum or steel woks that you buy
heats up real good and the meat and stuff doesn't stick to it like it will aluminum or stainless steel
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i love those fried vegetables
especially the watercress and the crunchy
the crunchy ones
yeah huh yeah we like we like seafood too and we found a little ole another little ole hole in the wall that makes excellent fried catfish
boy it's good
yeah i do too
we haven't tried any of their seafood and we again had some relatives here last week and we went took them there she had never had she was from connecticut
and she had never had channel catfish
and she tried the scallops i asked her if they were any good because i new the scallops were probably oh you know not local like catfish is
but she said they were very good
and she
yeah
well being from connecticut they're use to fresh seafood like shrimp and lobster and stuff like that
yeah
yeah
hm
uh-huh
yeah
i never have tried octopus it looks like it would be good because it's all meat there's no bones to it it's not
yeah
yeah
yeah one of these days i would like to try a rattlesnake too i've heard that it's delicious
oh i love frog legs
yeah frog legs are good of course you know you ask somebody what meat taste like just about any meat you ask them had a it taste like they say like chicken
but it does it's similar to chicken but the meat
the meat is sweeter
and the meat is it's crystal clear meat it's beautiful meat
now it is a little bits stringy
because of because simply they're frog legs because they you know they have the muscles and so forth
but it's sweet meat
now i don't i don't care a whole lot about lamb
yeah
yeah
lamb or veal i'm not real crazy over it
but while i was i i've worked for texas instruments out in ridgecrest california for eight years and one time we went down to bakersfield
and there was a basque restaurant b a s q u e
and we stopped there and ate and i wish i could find another one here
oh it was good they serve it family style everything in
what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation
yeah
uh-huh yeah i grew up in sixties and early seventies and my mom didn't work at all when i was growing up she didn't start working until i was
well into high school
so i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids
it's a luxury item for
mothers to be home with their kids
always home by the time you got home
uh-huh
it seems like there's it seems like there's a grass roots
effort or whatever going on i clean houses part-time and almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not are mothers that don't work
they're all it's and it's i think it's kind of a new movement it's going back towards
you know women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where you know
women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time
and i think that in the future you're i think you're going to see a lot more
women choosing to not work after they have a baby
i think with
the
the work force with the salaries that a lot of a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are vice presidents of companies and i think with
it seems like it's more the upper-class people
i don't see it as much the like in my situation where i don't i don't have children yet but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids but realistically that's i'm
realizing that's probably not going to be possible
for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income
uh-huh i think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids
yeah believe it or not though the all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home they're real active in volunteer work
one of the women is real active with muscular dystrophy
and does a lot of work with them
on a volunteer basis but it's still it's almost like a job but she just doesn't get paid for it
yeah
when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home or is she going to go back to work
that i would i would like to be able to do that
um-hum
yeah i see a difference in the generation of
even the generation before me
were you know mom was like mrs cleaver you know june cleaver or whatever where the attitudes were a lot different
as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more
there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and
a lot of the things that are going on in today's society i think morally
it seems like there was
the people were a lot better back then as far as having higher standards
huh
yeah
yeah that's true
and i think i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future
um-hum
yeah i think that
in the future the family unit as it as it once was known is going to be nonexistent
where do how do what do you think
as far as do you think there's going to be still a family unit or do you think that the trend is going more towards single parenting
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think that eventually the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore
it's it is that like you said the divorce rate is getting so high
that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are
you know two parent families
that's pretty sad
i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that it'll make the
the strain worthwhile
well i need to go ahead and wrap it up it was really nice talking to you
and thanks a lot okay bye
something about a food wasn't it uh-huh what was it exactly
oh yeah
oh
yeah
oh i've cooked the turkey before thanksgiving but
oh is that right does that take long to just have to heat it up is that all oh
oh
i never tried those
oh
uh-huh
that turkey's about a three or four hour project you have to keep checking on it and see if that little thing pops up and
oh
oh
oh is that right
alrighty
i don't know i've got mixed feelings about the topic
no okay
well
well i don't believe in drugs or alcohol but if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the tcat
they were talking about drug testing us
and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine
and we found it belittling
yeah
that's true
bus drivers
you know people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs
and alcohol
and
you know in those areas i really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our
you know house
yeah i think it's just like anything else a new concept you know as i had said if i have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen i was insulted
but at the same token in education we can't do drug random drug testing on kids
you know i mean their rights are protected
what well but why if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids
when we see them and they're you know under the influence
that's true
it's three minutes and the clicker comes in when it's time to
yeah no
yeah you know i believe that truck drivers and people that have even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk
and there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk
uh-huh
and yet
well no it you know we are as susceptible a society as anybody else
and
yeah well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation
yeah
then i think you know if it came push came to shove i'd probably be drug tested
you know because it does you know
yeah because you know as i say i'm sitting there fussing and fussing and yet i know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic
in school as well as you know i presume out
um-hum and you know my children brought it to my attention i never was there to see it
um-hum
and that's not giving a good example to students
i do
i'm a student and i work at nu skin
so
we're allowed to wear we just can't wear jeans every monday through friday we just have to wear you know nice slacks or just something that looks nice and then on fridays and saturdays we can wear jeans so
it's pretty standard i mean just more sweaters and stuff of course in the winter but
right
oh wow
um-hum
oh really
and you don't find that gets too expensive or
really
wow
um-hum
that makes it really nice
uh-huh does he have to wear suits and ties and
huh
yeah i mean it doesn't
it doesn't have to be that dressy guys have to wear ties at work but shirts and ties at nu skin but
other than that
oh no
but the guys seem to get to have to dress up a little more than the girls
no we can't wear tennis shoes during the week either so
yeah we can't wear
tennis shoes but i it's pretty casual i found i mean it would be what i would wear to school anyways most of the time so
yeah i well i work in the mornings from six thirty to ten thirty so
yeah how long have you been doing this ti thing
really how did you find out about it
he's in is he in dallas
oh really that's where i'm from
yeah
yeah what is he in a ward down there or
sure
okay
i like
yeah i'm more into suits i think i'm more
yeah more what's it called just
things that don't
do you
how old is it
you you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think
well
i don't i don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the training bit i've had dogs through the years right now i've got two
and three cats but
and my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a sheltie mix and we watched it this summer for two to three months and it wasn't trained quite fully either
and but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog
i don't know i i'm old fashioned and when i got my dogs when they when they did something i hollered at them and threw them outside they say that's not the way to do it now but you're just supposed to
yeah
no you don't wanna do that but
does it just wanna sniff around and
does it just wanna sniff around and play when it's outside
yeah
have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside
yeah
that's nothing huh
well it it'll catch on pretty soon i'll betcha i have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old golden retriever and she's gone the other way because she's so old she doesn't have much control
so we're battling with that problem and she still feels good she can't hear worth a darn or see very well but she's got a great appetite and she knows we're there by smell
she'll be sixteen in may
and yeah but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years so we're putting up with all her accidents
and the two nights ago she had diarrhea and so that was a bad one but i think we're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend
um-hum
yeah
does it oh
uh-huh
you know maybe you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes
oh
well you know where we went we went to the junior college richland
and we took my daughter was living at home then and she took our golden retriever or not the golden retriever the norwegian elk hound over there and
i think it was like a six week program
i think it was one night a week for like six weeks and you know it was a group class outside
it was fairly reasonable too
yeah they're usually a high strung dog aren't they
our friend has a
let's see i have a macintosh 2ci and i'm a graduate student in cognitive psychology
and so i use it basically to run all my statistics and write up my reports and research and all that kind of good stuff
um-hum
hm
um-hum
exactly and then i like to like go back and re-edit things as soon as i write it and
and you know you can't do that very well with a piece of paper and a pencil you know cause it takes so much longer to change things around and move whole chunks and all this that and the other
hm
oh okay
oh wow
wow
um-hum
uh-huh yeah i've started seeing some internet postings from fidonet and stuff like that
yeah
um-hum
yep
yeah well you know if we ever get any sort of isdn running nationally it'll be really incredible
if they have the amount of data we can exchange
right yeah well that and he's talking about expanding the internet as it stands now upgrading the backbone stuff like that
so you know it's going to kind of impact everybody everywhere
um-hum
um-hum oh yeah
um-hum
yeah i think what's going to happen is it's going to sneak into the consumer market through the television and through the cable industry and telephone industry
i was just reading in the washington post this morning they've got an article in the business section about how at&t has just announced that they plan to offer cable tv systems with five hundred channels by nineteen ninety four
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's not a bad idea i
that you know they probably need to change it somehow the whole system needs changing we've just got too many people in there and
docket and are putting too many
people in jail that probably don't need to be there and it's another form of sentencing but on that one thing i still think it should be a unanimous decision i think we're getting to the point now where they're gonna eventually let it be majority vote
and that's not gonna be good no
right
uh-huh
um-hum
oh yeah
sure
yeah
yeah
right
that
yeah
and the judge might know or at least it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better if it didn't we can come back for something else or what we've got so well so we definitely need a change in the system and
it's just piling up on us
right
yeah we're just not willing to as a society not willing to spend the time or the money to
do what it takes yeah
right
right
right
yeah
um-hum
sure
very true yeah
oh yeah you're very accurate
sure
oh
yeah
right well we seem to agree on the jury thing and but we'll need an unanimous verdict and maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make the sentence yeah
i do too
well good to hear from you
bye-bye
basically i'm usually the one that handles the money
it's been extremely tight but we've managed somehow
we pay the necessities
first
and
then
try and save some of it
but
how you want to go ahead and say what you do
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
so you've already got it there when you've got the
yeah
that's a good idea
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
and we do a lot
get a lot of things used
and the things that we do have i try and recycle a lot you know before i'll get rid of something i'll look at it and think what else can i do with this and how else can i use this
to solve some other problem somewhere else you know
and that has helped a lot
and i do shop the sales and buy more than what we need
so that i've got it ahead of time and i don't have to go out and buy it something not on sale because i've already gotten it on sale
then when the sale comes around again
go ahead and stock up again
sam's we have a sam's not too far away but i haven't used it yet
they're going to they're building a new one that's going to be even closer
and i'm i'll probably use it when it's over here even a little closer
yeah you have to buy quantity
but that's how you save money you know
uh-huh
yeah
yeah well i think there's an awful lot of things that we spend money on that we really don't need
and you have to
decide how much you want and i think i've noticed that however much money you have you can spend that much
or more you know people will go beyond what they have no matter what they have if they use credit cards that's one thing we're trying
try not to do is to use the credit cards because that just runs
we got changed to an economy account at the
credit union so it costs less to use less checks
those are just little things you can do
i
having a garage sale yourself helps
we just had one this last week end
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah when you can't use it any more
that's
i think learning how to do things yourself a lot helps too like i cut everybody's hair myself
and if you can just watch how they do it at the
shop or
uh-huh
wow
oh really
yeah i know what well mine's i guess i live in a upper middle class type home neighborhood
most of them are all professionals in the neighborhood i live by myself what i have more than i need i have a two story home which i don't need but
i got it as a steal and property i mean property in texas you know i bought came
i used to live in texas and i moved to florida for four years and i moved back and when i moved back was in a slump and so i really stole this house for you know for peanuts
it was a one of those corporate buy outs a couple had moved in it lived here three months and got transferred to
atlanta so their corporation was trying to sell it you know they just want to get rid of it so they took and offer i gave them which was very low
i know the neighbors probably hated me because it kind of
ruined the resale you know i think what though the average i think when you go to sale but we don't have too many homes for sale in this area because it's it is growing and building fast
yeah it's improving now where i live i live out by dfw airport and it's really growing like mad i mean they're just building and they're
i'm talking two and three hundred thousand dollar homes
that price range chunk because those people are going to buy you know whether it's you know rich people like that are going to buy you know there it's the middle income people i think and the lower middle income they're that are hurting you know that
sixty and seventy thousand dollar homes that are hard to get rid of
but and then i've heard pros it it's picking up though now it has
uh-huh
uh-huh
did it really
huh
that tells you something
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i know i do too
it helps though it helps the value your property
uh-huh
really
yeah
yeah right
yeah oh really
oh okay well boy they're sure
i've never seen so many two story homes and they're really building a lot of two stories all of the really fancy ones are all two story you just don't find any sprawled out one story homes anymore for some reason they're just
and boy the area i live in is really growing fast in fact they're just fixing to right behind me was a house sat behind my property it was on fourteen acres it was just a kind of a nice little brick home
had some horses and you know and a developer bought them out about six months ago and so they were going to build some really nice homes back there which will you know really help my house
oh do they
uh-huh
yeah you are right
man we have some in dallas has some of those zero lot line homes are you know five hundred thousand dollar homes sitting on a zero lot line and you can you know
wave at your neighbor you know and hear their
well they build them really where you can't hear them they put the living areas opposite one another so i guess it's all right i don't know i have a lot i have an enormous backyard a really much more than i can take care of which i don't i have it done because i can't
i tried taking care of it myself
the first year i moved here and i said i'll go without groceries but i'm going to have my yard done i just i can't do it you know it just wasn't worth it
so i have it done and i it's a best money i've ever spent is having it done
and it's just so regular and i just don't have to worry about it
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah i know
i know when i lived in florida my mother visited me she says you know you can almost watch your grass grow down here can't you and i said yes you can i mean it just grew and i could have mowed it twice a week down there if i had the inclination which i didn't
but that's when i started and when i lived in florida i had my yard done down there too it was the humidity was so bad that
i just i couldn't get out there and do it as much as i wanted to
i like yard work no i don't if i did i'd do it
if i had to i would do it i'll put it that way i don't have to so i don't do it
but if i had i bought myself i bought the best of equipment i said if i'm going to do it i'm going to get myself a good lawn mower and get all the bells and whistles and i did
but i'm but everybody in the neighborhood keeps a very nice yard thank goodness and that
oh okay
uh-huh i know it
i know it
oh i know but you know usually there in this new i've got one on this there's usually one neighbor in the in on a block that doesn't take care of their yard as or doesn't do anything to the yard and i keep thinking why do people buy homes
if they're not going to keep their yard why don't you stay in an apartment if you're not going to touch your yard you're not going to you know you just ruin it for everybody else i think i know where my daughter lives there's a woman that lives behind them
that the yard has never been watered and she lives in a real nice neighborhood and it it's i saw it for the first time this morning what a eyesore that was i said i'd run her out
that's a shame that somebody let their yard she has poison ivy growing over her garage can you believe poison and she's got children
and it's just oh what an eyesore terrible
but no i really do like my neighborhood it's close enough to dfw i can be at the airport in ten minutes
but i can't hear the planes flying i can see them from upstairs i can almost watch them land on the runway but i can't hear them for some reason
and i like living real close to an airport because when i get home from a trip i want to get home i don't want to drive forty five minutes you know after i get home i want to be home
so i always choose to live by an airport in orlando i did the same thing i lived right by the airport so i could get right home
and the noise isn't real i say i can't hear this and when i lived in orlando i couldn't hear the airplanes either
i guess if i lived right on the flight pattern it would be different but i don't i like i like to watch airplanes a fact i can lay in my bed at night and watch the planes coming in dfw and i'm
i know if they're two seconds apart or just watch the lights come over they must come all in from the same pattern
and sometimes i have come downstairs at night and used my telephone downstairs if it rings and i look out my kitchen window and
there must be thirty airplanes circling above not over my house but over dfw
it's the weirdest looking sign i thought my i guess they're
i don't know why they're all circling i guess they're but it's weird looking so many lights up in the sky
but i guess it's interesting i like to look at airplanes
oh are you
uh-huh
oh okay
yeah that's nice
i have a girlfriend lives in alexandria
west is it virginia she works for the government she's a
oh is it
yeah
oh yeah i do too
lucky and spot that's their names and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle and always has his nose all around my turtle box
so do you have any pets now
no i haven't either
oh and how big do they get
oh that's interesting
the water yes
yeah
oh
uh-huh well we've got a good size dog and we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog
for him because he likes other animals and for me because we used to have a miniature dachshund and i miss having a little one
you know around the kind you have sounds very interesting though
oh
uh-huh
and how do you spell that breed
f r i s e and how do you pronounce that
okay
i'm writing it out phonetically
yes
do they bark a lot
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
yes
oh
does she ever mess in the house
oh
uh-huh
oh gee
uh-huh
and about how much are they
and how about the and how about the person in houston
oh
uh-huh
oh yes
just pets
yes and it's very expensive
oh that's where i live
yeah i'm at coit and
um-hum
i haven't had to it's the every so often i mean i'm almost pushing it myself maybe i'll buy a shirt from gi joe's and it shrinks too much and say well i should have known better i mean i bought it from gi joe's and it was probably made in china by slaves
uh-huh
yeah
huh
yeah really
yeah i think they're beginning to the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away and
uh-huh
oh know still at it hey
wow
well they got a three year lead time it probably won't start really showing up -til ninety four or so
hm
the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer
and can you think of any other industry where in software they if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail it's like here
or maybe they say well you we know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade
yeah
and the hardware well i mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity and the macintosh is about the only one that's going it's right forcing ibm and the rest of the dos world to follow along
really why don't they just say almost a mac for half the price they could sell more if they were honest
yeah it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure dos
i mean that's their client base
um-hum
need to worry about the mac they're getting like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with the floppy drive
yeah i have one i do desktop publishing at work and i have a machine at home and i belong to the user's group and i i've been a mac fanatic since they came out
but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen
yeah
hi chris this is carol
this is interesting question come up here proposal for people to young people to spend a year or two in the peace corps or something like that doing public service i
suppose the idea is to
but the point be to that get
it sure does
yeah i suppose the idea would be to get people interested in public service
and to i don't know maybe people give young people an appreciation for maybe what they have and what other people don't have
well i tend to agree and in that we do live in the united states and i think one of our one of the
things that our country is based on is freedom of choice
forcing someone to give up a couple years of their life doing something that may not be or
the timing that they want to do it or perhaps even you know
maybe they would have something else just the idea of forcing someone to do something i'm pretty much against that
just on their own um-hum
that's right
i think there would be an awful lot of resentment and i really don't think it would be feasible on our country
that's right yeah some young people do some young people start families young and or maybe are responsible for their parents
brothers and sisters things like that
i suppose they may have exceptions but
i guess it all it would all boil down to
i mainly i guess my question would be what what's the purpose what's trying to be accomplished by
by that proposal
um-hum
you know i think that's true and i tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness of that at least i mean i feel i try to as an individual my children are very young but
i think they're being taught a lot
maybe to be more responsible
and
hopefully to understand that everyone is not as in as fortunate
as perhaps they are
pardon me
you know its also seems to me if someone does it on a volunteer basis then they will probably put a lot more into it than if they were forced
that's right
maybe just do our best to
that's right
yes
okay we'll talk to you later bye-bye
okay
so you go first yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
right yeah that that's how i feel i feel the employee the employer has concern about you know what's going on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and
there are lots of factors that affect how i do my job i don't personally take any drugs but you know that's one factor that could affect an employee's performance
there are plenty of other factors like i know for me how much sleep i got you know what i ate for breakfast those things have a lot big impact on how i perform during the day
and unless they're they want to get involved in all these other areas also
you know like maybe providing healthy meals healthy breakfast for employees or something like that you know i
that's you know that's one step and it what it is what they're getting into is the drug testing is a real quick and easy way and politically
feasible way of going about this because you know everybody is going to be against drugs you know well just about everybody is against drug use so let's test everybody for it
but the thing is it's not it's not my company's business what i do on the weekends or in the evenings you know if i show up for work hungover
then they've got something to say you know so hungover to the extent that i'm not able to do my job well
yeah but on the other hand if i go out and have fifteen thousand beers but then i'm fine the next morning
it's none of their business
you know what i do with myself or if i smoke fifteen joints or something and i hit or whatever
and that's how i feel about it things drug testing for marijuana i guess can detect use or actually they can do tests with hair samples of hair and finger nails
that can test or detect use like months and months and months previous
you know and so it's obviously that there's not you could've decided okay i'm going to stop now and may have stopped for three months and still it would show up in these tests and that's completely unfair
also especially it's unfair when the companies don't offer some sort of treatment program also it you know it's like oh we find you with drugs so huh you're gone
get out of here
luckily my company is doesn't do any of that sort of thing they were talking about doing the policy of testing new people new employees as they come in but not anything it wouldn't be random it would be everybody
and it wouldn't be current employees it would only be new employees
but i you know i
yeah
right yeah it it'll be
yeah
and i you know i don't think the companies have any
cause to do that sort of thing
unless there's you know reasonable suspicion you know if you come in
obvious glassy eyed everyday from lunch or something it's okay somebody's been smoking some pot here
then do a drug test if you have some reasonable suspicion but it's
you know there's so many things i mean if i were going through a divorce for instance which is something a lot of people experience that would really negatively affect my performance
you know are they going to require that i stay married or that i require me to some how have a perfect marriage or something well then you know that doesn't make sense
so it's
yeah
uh-huh
right well
in that case charge the employees extra
football
well i'm in plano in texas yeah where are you
well my husband was transferred down here
no huh-uh
yeah
yeah that's true but i don't know they have basically the same team they had last year i just i think the coaching stinks
you know i think he could have taken more chances this year
well that's possible but now i hear he's been talking with the tampa bay
yeah
well gee i don't know it's hard to say you know you hostetler brought them to the super bowl and i don't know
well it's a it's possible you know i who's to say i mean i don't know hostetler he'd he had his numbers were there i mean you know he had pretty good numbers but
yeah i guess yeah well how about the cowboys they're doing you know great
well yeah but now you know they're really on the road back you know i mean that game yesterday was terrific
no i haven't been to a game in a long time
oh really
i don't think so i mean i hope not anyway i mean he's so good you know
yeah he's real good
you know but i was disappointed he was too conservative and he just didn't take enough chances
and i you know i'd prefer them to get somebody else i'd like to see them get parcells back
yeah he left on top you know two super bowls in what four years that that's pretty damn good
yeah you know he couldn't really top it so and now i'm sure he's making more money doing you know sports reporting
what the giants
you know i really don't i guess i guess they can
i really don't know defense and offense i suppose you know i've got they've got the running backs well they could use a i guess they could use some more good receivers you know and
yes and navarro was terrific yeah they could use a couple of really good tight ends they really they don't really have you know really you know super tight ends
navarro he was injured and i don't know then he came back and then they released him
yeah
oh he was terrific he was like novacek is
right
yes i have my primary experience has been as an expert witness and two murder trials
and in each case it was a retrial and the sentencing was the same each time which happened in the state of florida happened to be death
but in terms of i well the question also was in terms of mandatory sentencing or mandatory sentences for certain crimes
i think
depending on in certain crimes i think that they should be mandatory
for example armed robbery
if we have convicted i think plea bargaining should be a thing of the past
certain types of
you know homicides
yes in homicides related to other than i guess what are called crimes of passion for example you know as you as you very well know
the great majority of homicides are
people murdering other people they know mostly people they know
so in those instances that's i think that there is some leeway there what is interesting in this regard is the recent case in new hampshire
the schoolteacher
and the life sentence she received
yes
and it came very quickly surprisingly
i guess it was they brought in their verdict and sentence at the same time did they not
um-hum
well in answer to you know answer to the question though i still think the sentencing should be in the hands of the jury even though as you say there are some
people who are reluctant i do not think again in the matter of that judges should have the
the upper hand or the only hand in that sense because i think if but i i've never served on a jury you probably know this better than i
if the jury does their job and of course there are those on the jury that do not i'm sure but and ask the questions and
correctly and then one of things i've always wondered is the ability of jurors to ask questions
well that and that's an interesting point i've never i you know i've thought about it i've asked myself you know this question before
i've never taken the time to do the research to answer my own question but i know that at least during the deliberations of the jury
they can ask questions
um-hum
right
um-hum
why does your voice sound familiar to me
probably why it does i work for gte
your voice you know when i didn't recognize the name but the more i listen to your voice i
i know i have heard it somewhere
and i was trying to place where i had heard it that's very interesting but now back to the topic
but because i work for
hal ammon
yes i am on staff to hal ammon to gte
i will and which will probably be the monday as a matter of fact
okay bill i recognize the name now i and my name is jim moscow
and so i've heard the name
and well back to the topic i guess we've talked long enough bill
but all right well thank you for calling and nice and have a good weekend
good-bye
sure
no of course i use credit cards i have a couple of credit cards and
and use them
well we try not to we're on a pretty strict and tight budget we use the credit cards however
when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy
or we use credit cards also if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing so
so
yes and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or somewhere where you know they don't take local they don't take out of state checks
and so when we're traveling some do you use credit cards often
uh-huh
oh yeah well that's a good thing because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month and they just pay the minimum required balance
yes and you get in over your head
it'll some people i know also try to use it as float
where they buy something now and say well i'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month when i'm being paid
that's true
um-hum
right
how are the laws in pennsylvania as regard well not the laws but the rates
credit card rates in pennsylvania for example down here when you go to a gas station
you get an extra charge for credit cards
than you would by paying for cash are they the same there
that's pretty steep
yes
um-hum
yes because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill
faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money
um-hum
that you can
can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to help yourself so i think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
do you have multiple credit cards
and do you find that advantageous or
um-hum
right
we're actually in the same boat we like to use three
basic credit cards that way we're not confused and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes to the end of the month
and
do you find
that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail
once a week twice a week or three times a week
um-hum
yes
right so the annual fee
right
yes so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card
plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty three percent
based upon what the state will allow
okay
well it's a real mixed
feeling about it
it's really good that we did well and that
we went in and did what we set out to do i have there's been like a lot of things said about if it was a political
if it was a war for oil or a war for ideals and seems to be real mixed between those two things
i don't know i think the
as we were when we started the whole thing
yale yeah
right
right
right
right
right
it's
it's a whole monopoly that needs to be broken up that's for sure
it doesn't it's they have far too much influence over there and they're so unstable that it makes it hard for
it makes it hard for us to deal with them
i have that same problem at
productive
and
i can understand why he felt he needed to go over there on the other hand it's too bad that he couldn't use this i know that oil's real important to our life style but it's too bad he couldn't use this as
a launch to say let's conserve more because he never said that
during the whole war he never put out like a conservation effort for oil
um-hum
right
right
right
oh yeah it's
yeah
i know i agree
well you can't yeah
yeah
that's where i got to too the first i got chills up and down when i heard the on the radio and the first time they started doing the bombing
yeah
oh
right it will be
i guess so
yeah we
yeah
it was difficult
yeah real thick
yeah
yeah i think they're versions of that
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
yeah i'm in dallas i didn't know that people from other parts of the country were doing this
no my husband does
yeah
oh no
okay all right thanks bye-bye
oh absolutely are you talking about benefits i can't think of one more important then than the you know the medical
insurance right
um-hum
that's right and
even have dental insurance now which is really good
so
it really does and
well let's see insurance i guess that would be one of the real biggies you know to a consideration
but with paying twenty percent
i know well see if you had a seventy dollar
yeah okay that would save you
um-hum
um-hum
how about paid time off
do you have a certain number of sick leave you know days that are available to you or is it
pretty much just depends on your supervisor
um-hum
yeah
oh that's right
yeah as you get closer to that time you start you know you start becoming
um-hum
but he can't touch that though right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah we had i had that too there's a certain percentage of your salary and the company matches it fifty percent not half-and-half i meant
they don't match it exactly but fifty percent which is good
your company has a lot of prestige
but
um-hum
well another thing our company does is as far as like taking classes either within the company or them offering classes to us or
or external you know they pay yes
and check they we i think we have a mandatory we spend at least ten days a year not or not well yeah
about something like that in taking classes and they're offered within ti but you we have training plans everybody does
so i mean they really
oh really
um-hum
um-hum that's true everything you everything you learn you
its yours and you it goes with you wherever you go so the more you learn the better off you are
um-hum
um-hum
that's true so salary is
salary is what we do work for and what we have to have that's our initial motivation
huh
that's right that's right
um-hum
um-hum
well i guess that i guess we've pretty well exhausted that
well nice talking nice talking to you
bye
okay what are you are you doing anything in utah on recycling
um-hum
is it a small town
that makes a difference here in dallas they're trying to
to start some curbside recycling i think they're doing a test personally my husband and i do plastic and glass and newspaper and cans but we have to take them you know to
to areas and the problem that i'm finding is that a lot of the places i've been taking things have now discontinued the recycling policy like it's hard to find a place to take newspapers anymore
oh really
well i noticed a difference we go to the kroger store here to take our aluminum cans and i noticed a difference you know i'd be getting perhaps a dollar for whatever i took in and i think the last bunch i took in which i didn't think was much smaller was maybe twenty six cents
um-hum
well you know what is so sad is that people are finally i think willing to do something about this and then all of a sudden the demand isn't there you know it's too expensive to recycle but i personally feel that we're going to have to
pay the price you know whether the government subsidizes it and i'm you know i sorry to the government get involved in too much of anything else like that but something has to be done we're just we're using our natural resources we're filling up the dumps and
um-hum
uh-huh
well and i know too my mother lives in a rural area also and it she would have to go like thirty miles to recycle anything and so of course she doesn't and plus it's difficult for her to
drive around just all that much so in a case like that you know they have to make it a little bit easier for people
to do that
and i'm hoping that they do this curbside recycling i'll be willing to pay a little extra you know if they'll go ahead and pick it up quite frankly it'll save me money in gas running around all over town
so you know little bit here and little bit there i guess it all helps
not a lot but i've heard the name provo before
okay
um-hum
i have played golf in the past i'm not very good at it even though i'm pretty well sports minded there's something about holding that club in my hand that i want to hold it like a baseball bat
so i can putt but i have a terrible time driving
uh-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah like you're supposed to well i even took a golf lesson
six weeks i guess worth of golf lessons and i had a terrible time trying to remember where your hands are supposed to be and over this way and under that way and keep your legs this way and it was
i watch some of the things because my father is an avid golf fan he watches every game he goes out every single day his whole stance
so i have my own putters and you know some equipment but the only thing that i would probably watch is like things that are local like the byron nelson classic that's coming up
and then there's another one out let me see off of one twenty one coming up pretty soon so i like to watch things that are close by to see if there's any names that are familiar with texas
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yes um-hum
right yeah well at least with now with the with the sports and the tv is they can get the camera's
just at the time the people are starting to swing so it makes it a little bit faster and a little bit more interesting but i think it's more interesting to go out and watch them
than it is on the tv and to follow like one or two people along on the golf course and then you almost feel like you are
in doing exactly what they are doing it it's so much more interesting i thought than sitting and watching it on tv i think it's kind of boring yeah
let me see because i followed several
and i'm trying to think who it is that i was going along with i don't remember now
i mean gee whiz i all i remember was we had tornadoes about the same time and that was the big highlight they were afraid they were going to go down through the center of the golf course and that's what i remember the most about that but i do remember thinking it was a lot different to be out there
watching than it was to watch it on tv
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh wow
um-hum
um-hum
sure well i know
play almost year round then yeah that's the reason is there's so many people who want to get out and go play golf
see my parents live in ohio and my dad what he'll do is he will come down here or go someplace else in the south to where it's warm so he can continue playing golf i mean this is what an avid golf person does
it is just so fascinating and then everything we get for him is all golf junk you know the golf hat the golf you know clock everything because he's just he is he is a freak when it comes to golfing
yeah he he's really something
no see he it's only been in about the past five years
and he's so good we keep telling him he needs to get into some of those senior tournaments and he says oh i can't get in there with arnold palmer and all those other good people
but i'm saying yes you could you know and then that's where you usually can make a little money and profit this way because his handicap has gotten lower and lower and lower every single year
that's right i know get to meet all these stars because i remember sitting on his lap when i was a little girl watching golf he has loved golf really all of his life and but i remember watching it golf with him
so yeah this is something that he can go and see all these people he's got to watch on tv for years and years and years and years so
and play with a group of people from here at work but i don't even think ti has well they may have a golfing
i don't know they may have a golfing club you know it's possible
um-hum
you know i hear about things like the tennis teams and volleyball and baseball but i haven't heard of golf but i'm sure they probably do
uh-huh
oh
oh no uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
okay
okay take care bye-bye
well we're actually saving you know both for the wedding and for a house right now so it's kind of a double whammy where i stood out i been few i bachelor for a long time so
in may when the stock plan i'm in comes due i'm going to wipe out the last of my debt i'm going to be totally out of debt
in we have a nice start toward a house
and
we come from a very different background where i came from a fairly affluent middle class family and my fiance came from a lower class
save every penny you've got family so we've kind of i taught her to let go a little bit more and she taught me to
do budgeting and you know really evaluate what kind of stuff we're doing
yeah i use to do that but
i found that it doesn't give you the flexibility floating something a couple of days when you need to
yeah i suppose when you've got you know a when you got a good pad of money where you know you don't have when you're not you know you cash flow bound
that's where to work at
yeah i've got i've got direct deposit i find what i helps a often lot is i have quicken
on my pc and i've got for the next six to eight month all my pay checks all my fix expenses
in there so i can look at my cash flow and i can say you know i've got to pay these on these dates and i can structure these debt payment around here
you know not debt payment in the sense you know paying off against
you know legal thing like you know paying credit cards off and things so that you know i can really map out and say on this date i'll have this cash flow and i'll have this net worth
and that help an often lot to look forward
i got such mixed message from my folks about
they're both in you know human services
they got hit real good but you know they're still remodeling stuff and things
so you know in the you know they would criticize me for going out and
and spending money on things to make myself happy but then they go and you know do what to me are cosmetic improvement to the house to you know get the same kind of thing now that more of a value added to there house then me going out and getting cd's or something
but you know it's the same kind of thing where they always thought i was getting mixed message about that
okay
what changes i guess the biggest i don't know your age judy but i in my lifetime the biggest is in
more women working definitely
yeah
for the right yeah
i did work in government
and before that i worked in a bank for eight years
and now i'm retired
which do you work in excuse me
in government
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
in teaching
but not at the college level
we live in a college town and i worked at the university for a while and there are there are woman there but they're not the high paid
professors that the men are
well they did have one woman dean but and i guess she probably did very well but
that's the minority
i don't know how
i think they're not selected
and course
at this university this it's a big engineering school
and i don't think there are many women in the engineering college
and that's where the high pay is
quite an well i think there are more than there used to be
but they may not go into teaching
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well i met one day that had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering and that really surprised me
uh-huh
uh-huh
i don't know i don't i don't know how many go on and get a phd in engineering
that could be that's true
uh-huh
that's right
oh
that's interesting
is it was she the major wage earner i mean did she earn more money that he did or do you know
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
i know one gal that's she's a cpa
and her husband is a house husband
and then they had a child and he still was the house husband he's the one that was going to
uh-huh even before that right
she was a little perturbed about it at one time i don't know how she's moved away i don't know how it is now but i know
we're we all went out one evening and
after work and
she was
there was an underlying note that she was perturbed about it
uh-huh
i told him let's face it you're a house husband that's what your going that's what you'll always be
she wouldn't have been that's right uh-huh that's right it would
uh-huh that's true
huh-uh
oh
huh-uh
no i don't
how do you feel your career has gone
you don't that's good
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh i was discriminated against very definitely in banking
it was terrible
right and the money didn't go with the positions
the promotion promotions came but there were there wasn't comparable pay for the responsibility
and i was told you don't need as much pay as i have because your children are older than my children or your husband has a good job and
i
uh-huh
i think we are programmed to just take it as it comes
uh-huh
uh-huh
i don't
well i work for an insurance company so i see a lot of verdicts that are pretty crazily decided
by juries particularly and i know in england the judges set all of the awards you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence
but then they leave the
the going you know if you will the going award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range
when you get one way out like that
that then really doesn't wind up penalizing the person that they went after who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us
if they get some of those mega awards against them you know they're not going to sit there and lose money if they're losing money then they're going to raise rates
so it all comes filtering down to us all individually
and granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged
you know
i don't know you know some of the health insurance is written that way you know that
arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases i think maybe
you look at the age of the person and their station in life and how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with
with that i mean maybe you don't award an eighty five year old guy the same thing that you'd award a twenty one year old
i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there and that may be where the judiciary is a little more
because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying to get anyway
if it's a company you know that they're insured unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance
which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages i think those should be uninsurable
i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that did the damage
yeah
yeah
for honest mistakes where they've done something and something happens one of their employees causes damage or something sure that's what they buy insurance for but
well i was just talking about any company
let's just say a lumber manufacturing company and somebody is on the premises and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures them sure insurance should pay for that
well i'm not talking about any loss i was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they're due
and then they're awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a usually a lot less but it's an amount their designed to sting them a little for their negligence for gross wanton negligence in a claim
and unfortunately the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too
so again it never really penalizes the company doing the wrong they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to
and if they if they know some practice is wrong you know i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences i'm talking more about the
you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that
then i think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think i'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself you know i have quite a collection myself and you know i'm a good hunter and i
started hunting when i was twelve years old of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes and you know i don't want to see them ban guns completely but i don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either
so
i believe that
yeah
yeah
yeah and it's you know it's got to the point now where even our police departments and our dea agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons because everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them
you know yeah so
yeah
yeah that would be
yeah that's
no it's sure not huh-uh
yeah
hum
yeah
see in california they
in california they make you register when you buy ammunition
you have to sign a they you know take your name and driver's license number hunter hunting license number and all that good stuff before you can buy any big ammunition
especially for handguns now rifles aren't too bad but
you know any kind of handgun at all if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you still have to buy it or sign up for it so
uh-huh
gee
gee that's not a bad idea
yeah
yeah it is
no
the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun
you know i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course i feel kind of weird about that anyway i think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot so
yeah but you know
it would definitely be gun control
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
myself
yeah well and the they're actually a necessity in life you know they're not you know not everybody needs a gun but
sooner or later i need one you know whether i'm out hunting or you know i've never had to protect my life or well i did in the service but not you know not on the street
so i don't really need one in the aspect in the aspects
no huh-uh
oh so mine are you know i use mine for recreation i don't and i enjoyed my guns i have a good time with them so
yeah
probably yeah
no huh-uh
yeah
yeah i had to explain that to my i've got a six year old now and he you know i have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old well they understand now
you know i've taken time to teach them and now the young boy wants to know and
you know like i told him you're a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and you know we'd start with the bb gun deal you know so he started with the bb gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows and i took it away from him i said now
you know so he's learning the hard way but at least it was a bb gun not a twenty two or a four ten or something so
gee
uh-huh
all right
uh-huh
yeah
all right
i think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one
you know i don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away so
yeah i think so
all right have a good one bye-bye
i'm trying to think do we pay too much taxes well i it certainly seems like it i don't know you know i i'm not up in the in the high end brackets myself and so
i can just imagine how bad that would hurt i remember at one point when my dad was paying nearly sixty percent tax bracket and that was just you know
yeah i mean other places pay more and you know so you can look at some place like sweden and you know they almost all give like seventy percent of their income to the government
they get some different things out of it though i don't know i i'm not i'm not terribly pleased with the distribution of it and i think we spend entirely too much on defense
although i work in sort of hi tech industry type thing and which in large part survives on defense contracting you know so
so i mean i kind of biting the hand that feeds you if you really wanna
sorry cutting it hard but
i don't know you know it seems like it seems like we ought to be able to get a little bit things ought to be a little bit more efficiently run and i and i think that we could get by without continually raising taxes
you know i mean i think i think we're at a point where you know it's taxes are a burden but their you know services come out of it and things are important but on the other hand
you know they just can't continue to rise forever and the deficit can't continue to grow
you know there's got to be some point where people sit down and say okay you know this is enough income to give government services at and we need to make sure we give good government service at this point and you know and
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
right you know there isn't there isn't the business cycle where government gets chopped down you know i mean they don't go through a restructuring you know even ibm going through a cutbacks right and you know government just doesn't do it
you know and it's because of in part you know necessary protections for the worker
but on the other hand there's you know you you've got to plan them in the real world also you
um-hum
yeah
right
um-hum
right yeah i mean i think i think you know in general i'm pretty pleased with the government with you know with america and a lot of the things that work here i mean
there there's lots of things that don't quite work right and but if you've ever spent any time in other countries you realize
that its all a relative issue you know everywhere things don't work right and some places they really don't work right and here they pretty much work right you know
but i think you know i mean if things are gonna things that need to change are things that need to be sort of restructuring you know maybe market orientation a little bit more and things like what you're talking about
you know putting a little bit more of the of the of the business pressures that are that are on everybody else on the government and so that we get a little bit more out of the tax dollars and a little bit
um-hum
yeah
yeah i think my wife's from brazil and i've spent a fair amount of time there and you wanna see a government system that just doesn't work you know i mean it's just its incredible its just
entirely corrupt they have you know something like seventy five percent or sixty five percent of the able bodied workers are employed by the government
you know and so that leaves everybody else you know this other small
um-hum
one girl went in state and has graduated and then that was
you know that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go and i have one out of two out of state both in missouri
and i teach in a college and so i had they had heard me talk about it and for years that
i didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate
so that was pretty much
oh they if they if they're content there but i mean as far as the education and as far as looking at the degree at the end that to it's very little difference is paid to it where you get that bachelor's
if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally and if they can get
two out of let's see
my son got a full total scholarships and so there's plenty of scholarships out there and so people should be advised to
to look for those and
well they i went we went around my son was a graduated from a jesuit high school and so he was pretty much looking for a jesuit university and so there were you know that was limited to
five or six different places and so he's in saint louis u and i
guess i played a role in that i just sort of let them
so i didn't have that much to do they just they just knew they wanted to go to college and i you know helped them
get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places we did do that and i would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up
some people don't do it and then they get there and
hate it or whatever so
if it's possible
right
i think in the short run it is expensive in the long run it's very reasonable if the person my daughter that's been in missouri for a
a second year now she's coming home at the end of the semester
so you know she's already twenty one she started late so that's you know strictly up to her and she'll finish down here finish this year down here and then decide what she's gonna do next year
it'll save me a lot of money because i'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition but again that's her decision
so but i have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back and they're much better students at twenty five twenty six twenty eight
so you know i don't i never have pushed them i just say that education is important you should do it
but they have to do the work
so
right
yeah
oh i think so
and also i'm opposed to the to the size does they've just gotten so huge and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand see that's just too many
ended up going to where i used to go and that was twenty five hundred when i went there it's twenty one thousand now it's too big
so
pardon it's southwest missouri state university
and it was twenty five hundred when i went there forty years ago and
my son is in a school about seven thousand and that's not bad i teach in a school about eight thousand and that's even a little large but it's much better than twenty one thousand
oh those rating the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything i don't
think it hurts to look at them i don't put that much stock in them but probably fine just to compare
plano's doing real good on that they have they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans
which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it and of course it doesn't fit right now but now we start in may breaking it down and they're picking it all up
so they're going to by and we have to separate our papers and our glass and then they have one day for like
oh everything you picked up from your yard and we put that in disposable bags and they pick that up on monday
so it's really great i i'm really going head you know completely for it i think it's marvelous
well does your where you work do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that
well down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your you know pop cans and things like that
so you don't have much choice there
well i work at jc penny and last week they brought they have a sign up that says for one full week
you bring in your old wire hangers
and they are going to recycle them
so it's getting people clean out their closets and such and then like the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in and they brought it down to the shelters
and they have one two they have
so they're really going at it and i think it's marvelous because
well
uh-huh
well did you watch the program the other night on was it save america it was good
the only thing i thought that i haven't been trying is when i you know go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants which i had never thought about before
but i've already gone to oh i started years ago i guess not years ago but yeah i would say five years ago turning off my fountain i mean my water faucet in the sink when i brush my teeth
but i didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water that was surprising to me
i missed that question totally i mean really bad i'm trying to think i didn't miss too many i can't remember what my score was but i did exceeding well i was surprised
but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed that was a shocker to me
well i was in bizmart the other day and what i don't understand is there is recycled paper in there and it cost more
than regular paper
and it was only i think forty cents more you know fifty cents more but
it upseted me to realize that hey the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling but people aren't buying it so the cost of it is higher
uh-huh
now see that's recycling
you know companies that do at least go into it i'd like to see subsidy by the government or something or taxwise or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular
so that people would use this stuff over again
it's like when he was saying which one was recyclable which was reusable and the recycle ones are better to use but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles
and if we're going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it
i had to put my bifocals on to see it
uh-huh
oh really
oh
well you know they're along that same line they said they were using
what is oh i know it was toilets you know the old ones smashing them up because they're that stuff there is great for in road work
and i thought well that's good and then i saw recycling on tires between well hoses were being used
and soaker hoses made out of old tires what else something else was made out of old tires i was trying to remember what it was
oh i can't think of it now
but i was i was trying to get my kids you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes
and just anything to you know recycle rather than keep throwing it away but my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring back and then i forget to bring them in the store
i'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out i wish they'd really push this recycling bit because i never realized i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away
you know what i'd like to see a little more i don't have any little tiny kids but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now
in five years when they get bigger it'll work a little bit more too
because it's we've all got to do it right now i just
i really amazed to find out that what is it eighty per cent are filled now in garbage fills in five years we're supposed to be at max
i don't think i can keep my own garbage
i mean i might not have that much
but i would
yeah
i use to i don't now
oh really
yeah that is what it is in arizona is where i am from
i have only been in california for about two years
and in arizona that is all they have too is man made lakes because of the desert
yeah
yeah
well i lived in washington state for a while do you know where do you know where seattle is well it's about thirty miles outside of seattle there is a place called westport
and it use to be the salmon capitol of the world and when i lived
yeah when i lived there i use to go deep sea fishing with my dad all the time and it was really it was really neat but when i went back to arizona because that is where i am from well when i went back there to be with my mom
it was like a totally different kind of fishing i was like ah what do i do
yeah
yeah
i haven't i haven't been fishing since i've been to california because i have been having my kids and
two
two little boys
one's three and one's one
yeah
sounds like fun
i'm stopping at two
i only want to have to teach two of them how to fish i don't want to have to teach four
oh
yeah
yeah it's amazing how few women actually fish
yeah
uh-huh
yeah my husband gets kind of upset because him and i have an agreement
i i'll bait my own hook and i'll catch the fish but he's the one cleaning them because i won't clean them that's the only thing i will not do
he gets really disgusted because he says i talk to the fish i don't talk to the fish they just jump on my hook
that's what he says because i'm really lucky at catching them
no matter what kind of fishing we are doing i seem to have really good luck and it's like i don't talk to and they just jump on my hook i don't know
yeah my mom got remarried and she got remarried to a commercial fisherman
and he was like women don't know how to fish and da so him and i went out fishing one day
and i and he goes do you need me to bait your hook and i said no i can handle it
and so i baited my hook and by the time we left i had six and he had none
he goes he goes tell you what
i said no thanks cause i don't clean them
so he cleaned them all and i gave him and my mom four of them and i just took two of them
but he was just so disgusted because he had never seen anybody that had that good of luck
oh yeah i love fish
i grew up in arizona so i guess that's why because
uh-huh
yeah
that's the big hit in this in this house the sesame street because they have you know the calendars and that kind of thing but i take the recipes and the home gardening and the furnishings from better homes and gardens
so
uh-huh
once a month
and i yeah i read it all the way through more than once and my husband i find him reading it too
uh-huh
oh we we're always reading magazines because we don't really subscribe to them we usually buy them off the rack and we're always buying life and people and
oh a few others i can't really think about but we're always reading magazines in this house and oh and time and
so we're always reading magazines in this house
and we saved all the time magazines from the
from when we went to war so we have all of those uh-huh well we yeah we saved them we thought maybe they'd you know
be useful later on in life when the boys grow up because we have two small
no the we don't subscribe to those we just get them like maybe
yeah uh-huh maybe once every three months or something like that but
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah he does all the time and
and he'll sneak one home every once in a while in the grocery cart but that's just i don't know those are just things i don't really i don't know i don't really find interesting i don't and he'll show me an article or two i don't believe it anyway so it's not
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh yeah
yeah
we usually just get the newspaper on weekends because we really don't have time during the week but we usually get friday's saturday's and sunday's and that's really about it but we read like the dallas life magazine you know in there and
those kind of pretty interesting so i mean just talking to you i realize how much we read i didn't really realize that that's just amazing
we do now that i think about it we do read a lot so
oh really oh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah that's a good idea yeah i've only done it once but i
yeah
oh
oh yeah well yeah there's a host a lot of things that center around that crime area you know from
from just people trying to make a living on the wrong side of the law to those who are just trying to keep their drug habit up and
so i think that it encompasses a whole lot of the concerns
oh really
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i just don't know what kind of criteria they have used for most of those early parole leases releases so
that's right i think you're right
i'm sure it has a lot to do with it
well i think
certainly that might have something to do with it but i also think that
the standards of what we consider normal is drastically changing each generation at least if not faster by because of the movies that are out there
and what all the kids are exposed to and also the grown-ups out there that we're just constantly watching and
what we would of you know used to consider awful is almost a normal kind of thing on tv now and
yeah and i so i think that it's and also i think
the way our lives our families are being raised that with a lot more single families or a lot more full-time working families that
there are a lot more strangers out there taking care of our kids and i mean strangers in the sense of not the close family knit types that they used to have
and i felt so i think there's a lot more people growing up confused and feeling not really considering you know necessarily as wanted or loved as they might have felt
had the family been a little closer-knit
that's right that's a good way to say to say it
not i don't think it will slow down for quite some time just because there's you know it's gonna take that pendulum a long time to swing back the other way
that's true
um-hum
oh yeah i think there are definitely are ways that both parents can work and have recent you know responsible and you know very loving children growing up and staying that way
but i think it takes the effort and extra time and effort out of those parents and not too many not as many people are doing that as they should because we're used to having an easy get it when you want it society and
you know the easy way out is considered more appropriate sometimes than the working hard methods that used to be
so
right i think we're all tired and having too many pressures and i just occurred when you mentioned principal it occurred to me when i was teaching how
it was becoming quite disturbing realizing how many crack babies there were becoming you know out there in the educational area and
and the things that we'll be dealing with just on the educational front that
are people that children that will eventually grow to be older possible crime makers themselves because they started out in life with having so many you know
well i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in specific
very specific in this very specific examples such as transportation workers as in air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing
too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very valid
thing for a company to say and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body
well i think i think i think the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here
like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane
but i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that it's such a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it
yeah i have been
i
right
yeah
right
right that that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just
been hired by a corporation
which you know i really the other side of it is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid and i don't really want you to look at it or something pretty basic like that just to the fact that
i don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work
i mean the during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also
right
right
that's exactly right
and also i just think it gets a lot i'm a big supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and i think that it just moves down along a line that
that i really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work when you know there's already talk of people well we're not going to hire you if you smoke
well you know i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their lifestyle at all
i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times
and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to want to do that
right
right
what the first one is we need people in there that understand numbers and the numbers that are being thrown around when we're talking in trillions of dollars
the elected people yes um-hum
our senate and congress and people that deal everyday and what's going to be done with those monies
and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works
we need to elect people that are more
you
well
yeah but people that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar
the lobbyists needs to be eliminated
from congress
they don't make pragmatic decisions they make a decision based on constituency
instead of a decision based on what they really believe
oh i definitely would yeah get rid of them
totally
i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that
and be registered with what they ever contribute but they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them
that that's a conflict of interest as far as i'm concerned
when you're talking again billions and trillions of dollars
you're jeopardizing the future of the country for today
and that
i think to bring it in line
you're going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line you can't ease into it took years and years to build up the momentum that's there now
i forget the figures on the interest rate but it's something like hundreds of thousands of dollars a second
in interest part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves we buy from intimate international banking that's why we have interest
and i really feel that is part of the problem
that we we've let things get so out of control that we don't wanna put the brakes on them
by having a budget that is feasible that is reasonable
oh of course yeah
and then add on to it
you take the gross national income
and you say our budget is x number of percent of this gross national income one thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax
across the board everyone no matter what pays a ten percent income tax
that's right
right no deductions you pay a ten percent income tax that's what you pay if you make forty million dollars then you're going to pay four million if you make forty dollars you're going to pay four dollars
and that's it
so how do you keep abreast of the world's happenings
what station's that
krld i listen to ninety point one which is kera
so that's the same way i do it i drive about thirty minutes to work twenty minutes actually so listen to that going and coming
uh-huh
what a deal
well do you feel like you're kept abreast
uh-huh
well what do you think about the us telling the iraqis to get out of their camp areas
it's a it's a different bold move i mean with still regardless if we won the war or not it's still the country is iraq
uh-huh
exactly
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah it's an interesting kind of a catch twenty two
that is a bit difficult
um-hum
um-hum
do you read t news at work
yeah that's i used to read that all the time
uh-huh did you notice what ti stock closed at today i didn't either
i hear it's forty two though yeah no well a couple of weeks probably about a week ago it was at forty seven
but that was i believe because of the stockholders' meeting
yeah exactly
pardon me
i did until december
that's kind of interesting that they can you know say get out of here in one and then the other side say come on over here
so that worked out pretty well for you i was talking to a guy from colorado springs yesterday who is
implied or inferred definitely that he has been surplused from up there and he didn't know what he wanted to do he's been with ti for fifteen years
so it's and he's a nonexempt he doesn't know what he's gonna do they're just shutting down the whole plant up there
exactly
uh-huh
right who got the contract
oh yeah i always get mixed up who's their partners with that late latest deal
is it lockheed and boeing
uh-huh
so gd didn't get it or is not associated
oh they are okay
so it's i thought it was lockheed and mcdonnell douglas or was that northrop
okay
yeah that'll be a biggie i wonder what they do with those planes now that they've made as test
test plane
there you go
yeah exactly alrighty well it's been good talking to you
um-hum
oh you like the rain do you
um-hum
yeah and i'm from utah so i like the four seasons i just don't like the cold
um-hum
yeah
the thing the other thing is the i don't like the rain either
so
i like it better that way um-hum
um-hum
yeah
the thing about when it gets hot here is i don't like the humidity that i really don't care for that
oh really
i don't like the rain completely we have a little garden that we have and so it really helps our garden and you know even i don't know
if that's because plants are just that way and they like rain or it seems they thrive when it rains they just really
um-hum yeah
yeah
well
well i like seventies i like seventies okay
oh i don't like nineties you can give me seventies and you can give me eighties and i'm okay but when it gets too hot then it's that i don't like that i stay in the house because it's just
it's just too hot
yeah
that's okay i've thought about that too and when we take our vacations we do take them in august sometimes so that we can be away from here
it just really gets way when it gets way too hot it's
and we've been here for several years and we've been here years when it's been hundreds
and
years um-hum
yeah
yeah he always did such a good job i thought
a good weatherman
yeah
anyway
i guess it's
that's okay they say when you're done you're done so yeah i you don't have to wait for them to say cut off your time you just say have a good day or whatever you say you too

and however and you normally think people in our position wear shirts and ties well many do but i am absolutely not comfortable with a necktie
i carry one in my briefcase and i wear it i wear it when the occasion demands if somebody important is coming to visit well i take it out and put it on
i wear a sport jacket sometimes and i wear well reasonably not real dressy pants but reasonably decent reasonably decent pants
and comfortable that way and a good loose fitting pair of shoes that i take off under tables when i'm in a conference room because i can't stand having anything on my feet
and say i like my shirt and short i wear short sleeved shirts all year round i just
yeah no short sleeved sort of semi dress shirt
but i absolutely cannot stand anything down over my elbows and when i'm working and i mean that's even in the winter time
well we'll have a day or two that it'll be down near zero as it has been the last two years just before christmas
but at normally it'll be in the thirties and forties on the coldest days and we've experienced some seventies here to eighties recently
but i don't ever feel the need to dress that warmly i don't have to travel that far to work what about your clothes in the winter time up there
um-hum
my goodness i i've not see that at all
um-hum
yeah
yeah
i think the thing that i've noticed in more recent years there's more ties and jackets and shirts as the younger crowd seems to want to dress those of us i've been here thirty two years those of us been here for a long time don't care to dress up
but when we came to work i was told that the president of the company set the standard of dress and he's he dressed like the janitor so we all we all did
and the feeling has always been that without the shirts and ties and suit coats that people were in a more relaxed atmosphere and you could have a freer exchange of information
malaysia four years in malaysia and three years in the philippines
and while i was gone this change to people wearing ties and jackets came about because when i came back i saw ties and jackets in ti for the first time
what was interesting malaysia is a tropical country just two degrees above the equator
and when i went over there i packed a lot of clothes and i packed two sport jackets and two ties and the ties got lost and never got there and i was there three years or four years rather and never missed them
oh no i think it was i started in nineteen fifty nine we're talking about at the most eight to nine thousand people world wide and at that time the whole world was right here in dallas as far as ti was concerned
is that i'm sorry that's
yeah i got a wait call hang on a second
and anyway where oh we're talking about the size of the company yeah it was about eight or nine thousand people when i got here it has in the past gotten up to eighty six thousand we're not we're not that high right now
but in many countries or
no i started in nineteen fifty nine i
oh yeah it peaked out in the seventies yes yeah i've got thirty two years in
okay
right
right we made those
yeah i used to referee soccer games and i would use those watches to time the games and i'd be out on the field middle of the field at high noon
and have to cup my hand over it and peek down there with my eye to see what time it was
and yeah we were about the first ones to make those and went out of that business in nineteen eighty one
back to back to clothes i don't really i don't really have what you'd think was an expensive wardrobe i mean some people are very clothes conscious
huh
um-hum
yeah i wouldn't i would think they'd spend at least that as at the cost of clothes
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
is that for like gym classes for pe classes and things like that
yeah
yeah
right how many hours are you taking
pretty fairly fair amount yeah we switch plants here and there do you like to garden
oh really
no not that part just the pretty part
yeah
right
yeah i like to get out in the morning
oh mostly i like to keep a little garden
right just like salad vegetables that kind of thing
and
that's about it
just you know and shrubbery and everything and to keep the weeds down and stuff put mulch around it so you don't have to weed them
it really is
right
right
so it doesn't look it looks skimpy if you don't
oh heaven
really
right
right i think it's only we've had a freeze twice
and it wasn't very bad
right did you get any snow
oh you're kidding really
right
well that's nice
no none not none whatsoever so some of the plants are still kind of growing along
so that makes it nice
yeah but soon it'll be time to go out and put some bulbs i get enthusiastic in the spring and then it kind of dies down
right
right
wow that's not bad
right
do they get rid of the ants and stuff like that
oh
not bad not bad at all though
to the point where the weeds are taking over the grass
oh my
oh let's see i still have onions growing in the garden
well they'll in texas they'll go all year around
and then if you want green onions you just go out there and grab some
no
yeah if you put them in all times of the year you can go out and take them you know for a green onion here and there and then if you have some left over they'll go to a regular bulb onion and then you can have that the next
the next time next year yeah
yeah
huh yeah they will if you let them alone and then you can put them anywhere sometimes i'll put mix them in with plants
just have a bunch of green here and there
and then oh let's see and then i put rye grass or my husband did put rye grass out this winter to make it look green
right you put it around september november to make it look green
right when it starts getting hot
it'll start dying down and your regular grass will come back in
in the
no huh-uh it has real shallow roots everything but you got to get out and mow it looks nice for a while and then it goes away and it kind of fertilizes the grass that's there all the time
that's interesting because i had thought i feel that it's a problem also but
i see your point on that
that's right
right
i kind of feel the opposite though i wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us but they're not speaking for me
well
is that true i didn't know that i was that is one solution to it
but i don't that's not really democratic not what i'd consider truly democratic
is uh-huh
uh-huh
it's a duty right
uh-huh
it that's
it's complex question when you start thinking about it isn't it
that's interesting i have people here that i know that have never registered to vote
and i think
i think they feel they can criticize if they don't
that's right i feel it
i think it is too sometimes it is a difficult choice you don't feel as though you have much of a choice but
it doesn't really gain anything
is that girl
now
oh i see
i'm are you a ti employee i'm interested not okay i just wondered
well maybe they should
perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age required to register and vote for four years and perhaps
they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty
maybe it should go with a drivers license
that is a privilege right
it is
that's correct
maybe it should maybe it should be
uh-huh
that's right
that's
no i haven't
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
sometimes i think we have that right now with congress
i think they're looking after their own
self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country
right yeah
yes i have a twelve year old
and i've been very lucky i haven't needed child care except for my mom so i've been real lucky i'm a nurse i go to school i mean i go to work early
well i could do it now but she gets lonely in the morning and i feel better she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just don't let her out of my sight so
you never know yeah she feels that way you know and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with but
we just feel better doing it this way so i don't know what day we'll stop we were about to stop one day this year and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats and so
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well i would too because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside and
and i just don't know what i would do if i had to do that i know the hospital that i work in is big hospital and they provide child care and of course they charge for it but at least all the nurses can leave their children and
they're always watching them they can eat lunch with them if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them and they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way
so yeah it is nice
right
well that's right
yeah right
yeah just never know i babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced and
it was hard to treat her equally with my child they were the same age and they played together and they were good friends
but like you said you tend to go more for the other one's side just because you are responsible and so it got hard and my daughter got jealous and
it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends because she had to be there every day so i stopped that after a year because it was difficult to balance it so
they do
um-hum
um-hum
i know i know
yeah
yeah well i would rather do without some things and i know that some parents they both do have to work but a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better
and i would never do that i never have done it and i just never would do it i would rather do without some things that really aren't very important compared to being with my child when they're growing up so
no there isn't there isn't any time that's true
uh-huh
okay
yeah
uh-huh i see
yeah
yeah that's for sure
well we i just got married about six months ago and we bought a house at the same time so we're i'm sitting here in my forty year old house and we're about halfway through the painting process
so
the only i guess the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color we ended up with our living and dining room are now
kind of a light peach color with and it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff so we've got the trim in kind of kind of an off-white
well they weren't the color difference wasn't so bad but there was semigloss underneath
we worked we've worked our way back into the hallway and we're in the middle of the bathroom now but it's been quite an adventure
the other the other thing that makes it a little more difficult we've got all hardwood floors and
we we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up
well it's not too bad it the floors are finished with a polyurethane and it's really not to bad to get off it we're just using latex and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even it comes off with like a
a mild abrasive pad like a scotchbrite pad or something like that and soap and water so we got pretty lucky on that
no not really
but
okay yeah
yeah
oh gosh
yeah probably so
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah i
we our house was painted as part of the purchase contract so we didn't have to mess with that this time but i've
i grew up on a farm so i i've messed with outdoor painting a little bit but most of that it was done with a sprayer and up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that so it
took a lot of the hassle out and then they're we're not you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a granary or something like that as you would be with your own house
a little bit yeah
yeah
yeah
oh gosh yeah just the opposite of what everybody's working towards now
we're they'll be there for a while we're pretty comfortable with that but yeah it i'm real nervous every time i open a new can i'm wondering if i shouldn't
buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a wash tub or something somewhere because i'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match
but it's gone pretty well it just it takes it takes some time my problem is while
i'm not overly proud of it but i'm a self-proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist and it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that
and i'll find i'll find something as i'm going along something not related like i've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they really didn't match
they were a few of them were broken and things like that so i always pick up these little extra tasks as i'm doing this and the painting actually takes probably a fourth of the time
and i i'm always doing all this other stuff and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else i've come home with from work this time to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that
so it always it gets you to look at everything real hard when you start putting a coat of paint on everything you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere
yeah
yeah it sure makes a difference
yeah
yeah it's been we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it and it was part you know part of the excitement was getting a good deal on an older house it just
it really hadn't been taken care of very well it was actually it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that so we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it but there just isn't enough time i i've
i find myself going to work knowing that there's a job about half done at home and i really if i would if i'd just stay home and finish it i'd feel a lot better but
not a whole lot it they're in pretty good condition
as far as major repairs you know a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that but the only the most major things have been oh
i guess i moved a couple of outlets and or switches i should say they for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway and yeah and i didn't like that very well so i moved that but
most of it most of it's in pretty good shape
live in dallas
okay
no i haven't i hadn't tried in fact we were we were planting flowers this weekend so i was pretty tied up
but
uh-huh
no that that's
yeah you know it i get a i get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that but no that pretty much covers my experiences
oh yeah most definitely it just it makes such a difference like i like i say the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much
i you know i don't want to put a price on it but i just feel like we're every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house you know every time i do something a aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home and
yeah we do it
it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't it's
i when i start doing trim i i've gotten to where i tend to freehand it because there there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that it it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and
no there's no carpet in the house right now
-kay
well you know
and you can you can tape them together and put
oh close to a year ago now i guess i'd i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
so i guess that was yeah that was that was fairly large undertaking a it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house
put all the interior walls up we just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work and that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together and
and whatever you have to put in there to get the to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that i didn't we didn't know a thing about any of that and so
it's it looked very hard to do so we figured well just i don't think we could do it and make it look professional so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living but
probably so and i'd we'd never done it so we just left it alone but that's i guess so i'm only twenty one so
i my vast experience of home owner's knowledge is not very much so it's just what i have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents so
it was brand new we started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house so it was
well my dad knew how to do most of it you know he
he had we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it i don't know he well he did all the flooring himself he put the whole the whole floor in and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there and then we were put us like a
not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less it's not you know it's not enclosed it's just
somewhere to drive another car to park and it's
it's off the ground
uh-huh it's on about twenty two inch piers something like that
so no those are we did those ourselves
yeah exactly so it's
yeah those are those are we'd i've done one i helped somebody do one of those before those are those are you know you can buy them in kits but we didn't do that way but it's yeah
yeah that is not near like building a house or anything but yeah those are nice especially when you get done you got something
you know i don't know i like them you just sit out on the on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue or
yeah that sounds nice all done by yourself huh designed
yeah
yeah that's a pretty that's a good size deck
so yeah that's
yeah that's right
yeah that's good that's not bad at all you didn't have to
the wood man it's it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know to get to get good lumber it costs i don't know about dallas but around even in this little town it's not cheap at all i was surprised
it's probably more there
yeah
well i don't i haven't i mean i haven't i used to live in dallas in arlington actually and but that was just when i was a kid so i don't really know what the cost of living is even like in dallas anymore but
it's i don't know we're a college town so that doesn't help us out any because we have gas is a dollar twelve a gallon so that's probably about what you're paying so
yeah
you got something going all the time
my children are in their late twenties and both are married and we do things as a family all together and when they were younger we were very involved in
little league and scouts and band and football and
things you know i have two sons things that you do together
yes one lives in plano and the other lives in lewisville
with their wives
right well i my husband and i always felt that if you want to keep them off the street so to speak that if they're involved
because it's a large school
you're just sort are a little teeny fish in a big pond here and if you belong to you know a smaller group you
just have a better class of friends and stuff and i think it's wonderful i admire you it's a lot of time out saturdays sundays and nights but it definitely is worth
the time to
oh yeah
all those things or have served them and still are
they remember lots of good times and we'd still hear frequently from
former teammates or band members or you know people who stop by and say hi to my husband and i and
so are you active
with i mean do you coach any of these things or
oh
well i'd
it does and but as i say i really feel
to keep them away from the bad element at school or just at the mall or wherever every
every hour pays off in the long run as far as
keeping the kids out of trouble and i see frequently see that here just
because it's a high school and you know kids
that's right
that's right they're also you know have parents that
either can't or don't care about their activities and don't support them and
over the years my kids have had friends like in the band that
in three years of high school band their parents never saw a football game to watch them i think i we never miss a game we still go and the last one graduated in nineteen eighty two so but we still
you know go to watch these things and
it's a lot of hours for a parents but as they
right but it i recall my own parents being active in my endeavors and you know i think
you just can't spend enough time with kids in quality time as i like to call it and
you know it's worth every hour
every so you have two children a boy and a girl how old are they
okay well see mine are twenty seven and thirty so
well we have bermuda grass here do you have that there
it's a kind of grass that dies in the winter time
do you live in an apartment or a house
so you probably don't do any lawn care
oh okay well we used to have a service come in
and fertilize and such but we ran in some into some money trouble so we do all of that ourselves now does the grass die there in iowa in the winter time
is everything brown
yeah
yeah
so right now we do nothing because it's brown and it doesn't grow until
later on in the spring
but
no huh-uh it just goes dormant and then it starts it's you know it rejuvenates itself in the springtime there are people that
that reseed in the winter time and grow something called winter grass or something like that i can't remember exactly what it's called
and so it's green in the winter but you have to seed over all of this other stuff that's
so did you grow up in iowa
oh
yeah
did your mom do any canning and that kind of stuff
huh
huh
huh
we have a garden here but in texas it's really hard to grow a garden because it's so
the tomatoes come on and they kind of fry right on the plant so it's real hard and the you know if that doesn't kill it the bugs do so i have tried you know with just very little success
to have a garden here
did you enjoy it did you like to do it when you were there
huh
yeah you had a compost pile huh
how many how many were in your family
was it something that the kids mostly took care of
yeah
yeah
yeah
what was your favorite thing
to eat
uh-huh
yeah
so what took you to iowa
uh-huh
where did you graduate
no i grew up in california
yeah
yeah do you have in your
scarily very seldom
only in dire emergencies in fact i leave them home
i have never
i've used them but never to the extent of getting in debt like some people do
it's just that since my money is tight right now
i don't even give myself a tempting
because i've gotten them all paid off
so now i just wait
before i use it
but like i'll keep one minor one like sears in my purse just for identification purposes
because i won't use it period
if
i'll use visa
but otherwise huh-uh
never
never
um-hum check
very seldom do i even use cash
um-hum
how about you
see that's exactly i didn't get in debt but what i did was one year oh i can't remember when five six must be eight nine years ago
when i paid my taxes i realized that i had ran up so much on my credit card that i was paying interest that was
ridiculous i mean sure it was the tax write-off but
there was no sense to it
i mean there was no sense at all to it i was paying more interest on that card than the card was worth as far as i could tell
so at that point there we just stepped right on you know just saving all the way in and i'll turn around like on my car i'll borrow
against my insurance which i pay five percent interest
and buy my car that way
and that works
so i don't have to worry about it but i use override at texin credit union
so that i don't have to keep too much i keep enough balance in my checking account so i don't have to pay
you know a service charge
and then i yeah
if i write a check real large it'll go ahead and pull it out of my savings account
so i don't have to you know worry about it one way of the other and i just keep that minimum balance in there
so it just you know and i pretty much budget that way all the way around but as i said my money's tight
right now
yeah
there's no charge for it
so i do it that way but i do as i said i keep the credit card in my purse for identification
when somebody wants identification one way or the other
but usually i won't put anything on that card unless it's something i really unbelievably need otherwise i better have it somewhere else
because i'm like you i'm not going to have a balance on that thing because it's too easy
i know too many people that pay off that card well i've got this credit card well maybe i'd better use that one or something like that and i'm saying huh-uh not me
well it's like the little piece of plastic for
to get your money out or the credit union all you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other
and like i'll run down there like you know for vacation and things like that and i'll leave it in there in savings account till the last day
and then i'll put the card in and pull it out what i want
but i'll pull it out of savings because i don't keep any balance in the checking
but that's still that's easy enough as it is but i wouldn't use the machine to pay fifty cents or a dollar for it
i won't even go that far
but i'm like you if there's something
really that i wanted
i'll write to them before i'll put the credit card call in though i won't put it on the card unless i really
i'll take write them check for it
because it wastes too much time
on the credit card and i'm kind of i'm leery about things going on my card because i've had
you know had to go back and return something and it took so long to get it off and that was years ago
so i'm having real good luck with a credit card
i mean it came off there's no problem but it just takes too much
scares me
and like tom thumb's got credit card now they used for groceries
yeah over here in plano
uh-huh
and you can charge your groceries on it
and you can either charge your groceries on it you have a choice or you can write a check and they okayed it that way
so you don't have to keep going and get it you know credit check and things like that and they'll give you an extra twenty five dollars no charge or anything else like that but i won't even put that on the groceries
because hey what happens if the clerk marks in an extra number or something like that and i don't check it
no thank you i don't want anything going on my card you know in my checking account unless it's i know about it
but do you like discover card i hadn't heard too much about it
um-hum
uh-huh
hm uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
yeah when well talking about public education
i was i'm we're doing a proposal at we're doing at nc state
we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum
yeah well i went through private until ninth grade
yeah
oh yeah big difference
well
in public schools i guess
there are a lot of you know people can take lower level courses and get away with learning nothing
but in private school you couldn't do that you know you had to learn
uh-huh
huh
it's bad
yeah our state just cut a whole bunch of like
think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget
so we're making all kinds of cuts in college
people cannot i mean the teachers can't make tests anymore and the library's canceling all it's subscription
it's pretty sorry
uh-huh
yeah
huh
and
yeah
yeah i'm working on my projects trying to
yeah
nc state
nc state
yeah
well yeah i was
i was born in raleigh and then i lived in winston-salem rest of my life
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah where'd you go
where did you go sorry
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's sorry that they like pick on you know that the advanced students and pay more attention to them ignore the others
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
i think i'm going to chapel hill
the acc tarheels unc
they were in the final four don't watch basketball
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
ah i can't wait to graduate either now i got all these stuff due oh wow
overloaded
all right
all right thank you
all right bye
oh just fine
oh it's been beautiful here lately
yeah i've got a two year old and we hunted easter eggs yesterday and the weather was really nice
um-hum
we had a
yeah
it was raining last year we had
uh-huh we
oh it was awfully rainy last year it was a it was a very wet spring remember how they had all that flooding down
oh
did it
oh really
i did
yeah
i'm we're not from texas we're from further we're from missouri so it's
no i like the winters but i don't like the summers down here it
it's terribly hot in the summer here i just
when we moved down here our we had a our vehicle didn't have an air conditioner
it would be terrible
um-hum
oh
yeah
it's
oh it is you know
oh yeah that would be nice oh i get the our electric bill in here july and august is just about kills me it's because it's so hot
because i don't think they build them as energy efficient down here as they do up in the north i just really don't
because of the winters i kind of miss winter
since it didn't do anything down here this winter
no we didn't no we didn't did we
that was that is surprising
and i it was really odd
but we went home to missouri at christmas and we had well we ran into town and in the ice
as we were coming into town and then it snowed a half a foot
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
i'd rather have the snow than the ice
because in missouri we have a we have a lot of ice
and snow but the ice is really bad
because it knocks out power lines and you just you just least at when you've got snow just about everybody has four wheel drive vehicles
so the ice you know that's a whole
uh-huh
that's a
yeah
that'd be nice
did you all work at ti
ti colorado springs
oh okay we got we had a lot of people from my husband's old group that moved out there
yeah
and they're still they're still out there though
did oh they're they are everywhere they
yes uh-huh
it just everything just kind of gives up and dies here
no it the trees just go to about the first of december and then just oh well it's time to die so it just it's just an ugly mess
yeah
yeah my grand
this year
well yeah
yeah
well the maple tree the maple trees have a lot to do with it maples make a lot of nice color
which there are none down here
it's too hot for them
we have a lot of maple trees in missouri so we have a lot of nice color too but the northeast really has the
on the on the real nice color
but i like spring i like i like the reason it's i like that spring comes
yes
oh
oh definitely
oh my two year old she hates to be in indoors anyway and just
um-hum
oh whew
yeah
yeah
huh-uh
i know
yeah well when we moved down here it was it was june and it was just like a shock
how oh being it's just so much different
it just i just couldn't it was just oppressive the heat down here
and i just couldn't
so
well nice talking to you too
our most recent
in series of projects i guess was inside was we remodeled the bathroom recently
well it went pretty well other than the fact that we encountered some problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing
which one thing led to another
and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes
from the sink clear back to the main drain which meant you need take the wall out and start all over
it wasn't one of those
it started out as a sunday project and by the by the next sunday it was done it wasn't a one-dayer
believe me
yeah it's good for another thirty years
yes
well that's the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing
everything in there was copper and it was all soldered
that's what drove me bananas because you know i'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and
and cement
to fit them together and nothing wanted to go so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over
really
that was an all day job just to get it plumbed
fortunately i was very fortunate in the fact that when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked
everything worked and i just said that's marvelous i appreciate it
well i expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or didn't use teflon tape on one or something like that
but it all came together so i felt pretty fortunate about that
how about you
um-hum
what kind of paint
um-hum
was it not washable paint
um-hum
what color is it
pink okay
did you require more than one can of paint
um-hum
you didn't have to mix paint then right
okay
um-hum yeah
yeah but you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with
how'd that go
kind of fun isn't it
really
repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you when you buy your paper
yeah
normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats
yeah
hm
when you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall
or did you start at the edge
um-hum
um-hum
i've had my best luck in papering when i start in the middle of a wall and i'll start with a plumb line
and start in the middle of the wall and go from there
and go all the way around the room
well you
okay
well gosh all kinds mostly between the ages of two and ten
last like a few summers ago i kept two children every day for the entire summer and i mean they became like my children
and they live in an apartment complex so we swam a lot and we played on the playground a lot and
we would go to a movie on thursdays and
there was always an activity you know they had their favorite tv shows and things like that we watched and then we took naps and
i don't know it just seems like there was always something to do children are so full of energy
and oh they were they just
one parent
yeah she's just
and they would have dinner and then it was time for them to go to bed
now at this particular time the children were two
and
six
but then i also i've been babysitting this child for about eight years he's nine now and you know i've watched him grow up and he's like a little brother to me
and it's changed over the over the years
we get along a lot better now that he's older
and we do different things now we used to play ball a lot but now it's he likes to watch tv and he's into wrestling and i kept him on friday night we went we went to go see a movie and
things like that but i feel like i don't know when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them
uh-huh i go to lsu
communications
oh yeah i mean i love children i don't know seem when i was growing up my mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high
and i don't it would i think it was very beneficial to us i mean like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books and we went skating a lot and
you know she was just always there for us but nowadays if there are two parents to a family the mother works just as hard as the father does and the children either stay at home and get into trouble or they're stuck in a day care
and i just i just don't want my children to have to be raised like that all my friends they their parents worked all the time they got to stay at home by themselves and when i was younger
i thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things like i couldn't ride my bike across the street but they could because they're mom would never know it but now i realize that it was better because
they have got into a lot of trouble
because of lack of supervision
uh-huh
well i'm majoring in public relations
yeah
yes ma'am
right uh-huh
well i would like to stay at home with my children for at least the first five years
but what i plan to do in the future is go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters and work on my doctorate and teach college
and in that case then i'll be i'll be at home when my children are at home but i'd like to stay at home with them until they get in at least into kindergarten
where they're at school from what eight to three or something and then i would be at my school teaching
and
oh really
what grade
oh did you
what did you teach
oh i started out as a pe major
in education i wanted to be a pe teacher
i sure did
oh yeah
uh-huh
oh
yeah
that's right they need some attention
well see whenever my mom stayed home with us we did without a lot i mean we were it's hard to make it on one income but we did and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years and
you know we only had one car we only had one telephone you know we didn't get to eat out all the time but i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar
and i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up and i hope that i can provide that for my child too
oh we have
uh-huh
it is
it's way too late i agree
it is
because all the peer pressure
it starts in high school and the parent really needs to be there for the child
oh great
yeah
well i guess that was good that you were you were hearing it from other students
well
does your son work for ti
oh
oh goodness
have you had any snow up your way
well i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills mountains in utah
guess this last weekend and she had quite a bit of snow on the ground her way
yeah well the weather here is always a topic of conversation in texas
but
we have wide variations and have
warm weather when most people have cold weather but we have our share of cold weather as well the temperature this morning was right at freezing it didn't stay there but it was
right at
we usually have some of our coldest weather toward the
end of january but this year it wasn't bad at all i guess that's because we had so much rain
oh yeah
well my
my sister lives in houston and they
the river there was in the flooding stage near where her son lives and that
caused some concern of course
they have a lake cabin and their dock was completely under water on the lake
so we really had a lot of rain
right
yeah we had a lot of flash floods in the area we had a few people who ran into
water and a few fatalities just a few not more than ten
but
well the
there's an old profane
expression about texas weather it's always too damn cold too damn hot too damn windy
well el paso won't be cold
no it's quite southern and it's rare to get real cold in el paso
the
you'll be flying in there
well take off is fun from el paso because you normally the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain the rockies
and they're towering above you and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again
well
well i noticed on the weather map on cable network that
there was supposed to be a storm front moving into california and on down your way but i guess it didn't pan out huh
hm
oh boy
um-hum
huh
well we had a bad siege last christmas a year ago we went up to visit my wife's
sister who lives in calgary alberta
yes it looks like i'm gonna have to get up there again because we may have a leak
we've been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around san antonio but well i'm right plano is just north of dallas
and there are parts of downtown or near downtown dallas are under water right now i guess i saw on the news
well we're up we're north in
oh about i don't know eighty to a hundred miles south of the oklahoma line i guess
we did have a little bit of rain yesterday so far we haven't had any today and i suppose that means i should be
getting up there to look at that shingle but i had something else planned today so i guess i'll let it go awhile
no i as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet now this we just bought the house last year and just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles so
i've just recently had to start looking at it myself
so it's a small problem so far but i guess you just have to keep on top of it what kind of roof do you have
oh
uh-huh
oh it's pretty steep parts of it are steeper than others
and remember to yell geronimo if all else fails
it's actually just twelve years old now
thing is we've
the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some
squirming i call it of the foundation we're just on a concrete slab you know but the soil right under this is a clay and it
well it depending on it's moisture content it either swells up or shrinks
and course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot longer
and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from drooping and
but anytime there's a change in the weather like the temperature
drastic changes in temperature or in moisture you get little spider web cracks all around windows and doors
well this is all it's all drywall
yeah right
but somehow or other that does manage to show these little cracks i don't know quite how that works maybe it isn't drywall
i don't really know
yeah i think it is
i expect that's what it is yeah
yeah i think that's the way this is done fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet so i
yes well the previous owner had a major problem with it because
oh probably a variety of things his neighbor used to
yes
um-hum
have i no i guess not
yeah
yeah that's it
that's true that's true they in fact also i don't know if you're familiar with the japanese method of dealing with crimes
but they don't they have an extremely low rate extremely low especially considering the density of the population and stuff they have they have this sense of family that's very important to them and family honor
the offender's name in a newspaper that gets spread all over the country and especially in the region that they're in
it well it gives the person's name and the family is typically so embarrassed
that they have to they sell their house they leave they leave the region and move to the opposite end of japan and so it shames the entire family including the grandparents and maybe aunts and uncles
uh-huh
right
i'm willing to bet yeah
uh-huh
yeah well you know the i guess the thing is you know with the in part one of the things to blame is the disintegration of the family in general and the importance of the family and that's
but you know you can't just magically push a button and make that come back i guess but
probably related
but incidentally i just reading in the newspaper about this they're i don't know they were moving some of the highway things in here in texas the offices
and they had ranked dallas as being
seven out of seven on scale of quality of life and i assume that includes that includes crime nowheres nowhere else in the state was above about a three point two yeah and dallas was a seven point o
yeah
i really yeah i thought it was pretty surprising
yeah
at the ice cream parlor guy just walked in and
yeah i guess
but you know look at the what's the cost of keeping them in it's something like yeah it's like twenty thousand dollars per year to keep somebody in jail
hum
huh
yeah
yeah
huh
you rather have people to cry to yeah but i don't know you know i mean obviously you know obviously some more jails isn't really the solution either i don't know i mean that doesn't seem to be
terribly effective
yeah well there's there've been several you know those kind of died on the vine they were there were separate proposals around to do that kind of thing and i haven't heard anything about them recently and maybe i'm the one that just hasn't been paying attention
uh-huh
uh-huh
what the citizens do although i do see this as
something that definitely needs to be taken care of whether that whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or in the or the hands of hands of the government is a you know a different question i think as far as i'm concerned in a in other words i am in favor of drug or drug testing
i was drug tested when i came to my job here at ti yet but at the same time i don't think that should be governed by the government per se i think it should be more by the private institution
how about you
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
sure
were corporations and private industry to take command in this situation that maybe
course that might up crime you know and people go in and steal your television and sell it just because they can't they can't work anymore you know
i what do you think what percentage of corporations and private industry do you think use drug testing
oh really uh-huh
right yeah what kind of work are you in
uh-huh
uh-huh and did they give you drug testing
oh okay
uh-huh
oh so are they going to begin spontaneous drug testing
uh-huh
oh yeah
sure uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i do too
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah
sure yeah i would agree with you i can't see i can't see how we can expect the you know
there you go
well jean the subject is jury trials and should the jury recommend
sentencing
now my personal opinion i don't know here lately it seems
well up until a few years ago i guess there just too many liberals about and permitting too many
those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned loose on parole it's just not right
and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing
yes very possibly so many of us have led sheltered lives that when we go into a sit in on a jury i've never done it myself
unfortunately i wish i could have
i've just never been called up
well now that's possible
but i was called up as an alternate once but i never made it to the jury
not that i know of
uh-huh
i've never heard of it
i suppose it should be
exactly
is it guilt or innocence but then again so many times you get one or two holdouts and it permits the criminals to get a retrial
and now that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances i mean that's happened
and giving them another trial might give them additional time to prove their innocence
yes we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials
hum
um-hum
oh that's it and you just might resemble somebody
out here in texas we had a
great miscarriage of justice here it was finally after nine years it was finally
taken care of we had a black man was accused simply because he resembled someone who stuck who held up a 7-eleven i think it was
and even though he had witnesses that said that he was at work and he had all sorts of a character witnesses and whatnot
they found him guilty
well they said it that this happened during lunch time and he could have gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery
but after nine years well as a matter of fact they made a tv show about it after nine years they finally came up with evidence and to prove that he was innocent
exactly now that just was not fair
so
yes unfortunately that's what happens
well it's not the it's not the best system but it's the best one in the world
uh-huh
and unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things and they trying to solve them and everything and but oh i don't know i think the supreme court
well i'm still rankled about their decision to permit burning of the flag
well it the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action
and oh that just rankles me no i swear if i ever saw somebody that
burning a flag i'd try to kill them i would
well i happen to be a flag freak i served i was in the service i was in korea
and
well i saw what the red in the flag represents
um-hum
yeah see what they
see how they like it under another flag
um-hum
well jean we seem to be of
the same opinions here i hope they get something out of this
oh passing sentence well
yes but i think the jury should be able to recommend
yes
oh yes
i don't know if that's a regular procedure or what
but i know i'm always hearing that well the jury came in with a guilty verdict and they recommended twenty years or something
yes
of course now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five
um-hum
yeah but too many times they are permitted to go out on parole and
yes they just go out and repeat their crimes
well there well they say after three offenses why it's automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses
um-hum
yeah very true well here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently
race or nationality even
but like you said it's not the best system but it's the best one we've got
um-hum
sure enough
jean it's been awful nice talking to you
well let's hope neither one of us ever have to run into this with subject we've been discussing take care now bye
and also a few annual plants and then every year i grow a garden
yes
we have virtually no room out in front and then in the back i'd say we have about an eighth of an acre
and we pretty much fill it up with
like i said perennials things that aren't don't have to fool with every year but then i've got
a twenty five by twenty area
that i do gardening as far as you know tomatoes and cucumbers and beans and
no we have a separate area for the garden
yeah and last year was the first year we tried two new things we tried corn
and we tried a watermelon
i enjoy doing it on a limited basis i don't think that if i the reason i bought a town house is so that i wouldn't i get i'm allergic to grass
so i don't mow grass or anything like that so i think if i had a big home and a big lawn i don't believe i would enjoy it but just on the limited basis that i do it i do enjoy it very much
oh wow
how about that
well that's nice
that much land requires an awful lot of time
how about that
well i bet you could answer a question for me what's a good apple to bake pies with
yeah
yeah that's great well when i was a kid my father had all different kinds of travel trailers
he was always buying new things like that and i hated it i hated going camping and
when i got older i liked things like caesar's palace you know that's where i like to stay and
right exactly so this summer my boyfriend lives in california
and he loves to go camping and he let's go camping and i went
in california in the mountains
it was just beautiful and it wasn't very crowded it was during the week and it was just wonderful
oh they went all over
yeah i mean they even moved they did they went to parks like well we lived on long island and
we went to new jersey and things like that you know not far away and then to the extreme
they sold everything and bought a house trailer
and moved
i think they said
really
oh
yeah
yeah i wouldn't like to go to the same place all the time
yeah that's boring to me too
well there's so many places to go if you went to a different one every time you couldn't see them all so
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
uh-huh yeah i have it's been a long time though
uh-huh
if i get invited maybe yeah
that's the hard part
oh yeah
how long to go for
i don't know we've only gone that one time and
it was five
in philadelphia i think the worst is cars
because there isn't a lot of manufacturing right in philadelphia any more at least not any heavy manufacturing
right a lot of pollution from cars and also the trucks that drive around through so i think transportation is the worst right here in the city
oh right uh-huh
uh-huh
and plus we get the -fluorocarbons i guess from the old refrigerator and old cars
right
well you know in philadelphia they've got these vapor recovery nozzle on all the gas tank now
if you go to the gas pump you it just sucks it back out
it makes it really hard to tell when your tank is full though
because you can't really lessen very well
you have to just trust the automatic shut off
so you can't really get it full if you are going on a long its really hard
yeah from all the gas stoves and everything yeah
uh-huh
that's true though most help aid don't let me use
bathroom cleaner with bad chemicals in them any more
right they make me use simple green or they will let me use comet or self cleanser but
right it suppose to be none toxics and its suppose to be good for the environment
so they like that
i prefer
ammonia
and
there's something my mamma gave me
last time i was visiting her its a
it's called scrub free it really makes a bad odor though so my housemate don't like that
scrub free
right
you know i knew that the air in philadelphia was not the greatest when i first came here it i lived where i could on a clear day
see the walt whitman bridge but i couldn't see it for a couple of months until it got to be winter time and the pollution cleared up
from south carolina
but the amazing thing i was out at san francisco a few years ago and the air there is so clean
right
uh-huh
right on the top of the mountain yeah
right
oh cigarette smoke the worst place for air pollution of cigarette smoke is the laundry mat i hate that
right when people come in and they're smoking while they're waiting for their clothes and you take yours out
and they're all clean and you want to hang them up and
there all these people smoking there
fortunately i've started going at an hour where not many people smoke
but
i really hated that when that was a problem for me
boy
boy i'll chose regular cigarette smoke
but if there was as many people smoking cigars as there were cigarettes cigar smoke would definitely be worst
oh right
okay do i still can feel that the soviet union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world absolutely
and my reasons are based upon not only from what i read in the newspapers what i see on the newspapers but up against some of the
fun and exciting things i ran into during my six years as a soldier in the fifth special forces group
well that's what makes it a powder keg
the
i'll go back in time a little bit to about eighty one
when my first real involvement with the military started
naturally we were at the time the soviet union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat so we got lots quite a bit of
information as well as indoctrination on soviet tactics and weapons
i went to lebanon in eighty three before the marines ever got there with the un peace keeping force
and with the training i received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against
these weren't these weren't chinese made copies these were soviet made top of the line fresh out of the box ak-47s
as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into
in granada in october twenty fifth eighty three we invaded the place
sure there were cuban soldiers there but there was also a bunch of russian advisors that were damn good shots
the team i was with we jumped in on the western tip of the island down on point salinas
and for every cuban there was at least five russian advisors
and they were all shooting state of the art soviet weapons
in eighty four
i was down in central america as an advisor to the honduran army
again we were running up against cubans quite a bit plus soviet advisors
and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate soviet made material
do i consider them a threat absolutely
they have a university in moscow called the patrice de lamumba university
about like a and m or ut where they're teachings subjects like that they're teaching terrorism
some of the people we went up against in lebanon were graduates from that place and let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against
i'm surprised during this iraqi crisis we didn't have more
incidents than they did
these guys are top of the line
when they when they graduate from there
they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world
and they are very good at what they do
so until i see the entire
quote old guard
of the soviet military of the soviet government
completely roll over and disappear preferably buried
i still consider them a threat
their military is different from ours to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands
of troops
that irregardless of what soviet policy is they're going to do what the general tells them
well it's interesting watching the different soviet states albania lithuania
doing their little revolts down there
each one of those sectors has got a soviet general over the troops that are there
so far they hadn't run into the real psychos yet
there's probably five or six which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs that are in positions over some of these soviet states
if uprisings happen in their sectors
it is it's going to be a total blood bath
actually they're showing remarkable restraint
they get real nasty the hyundee helicopters come out and they
would level entire areas
okay you're from the dallas area right
okay you know basically the size of the area around richardson
you put five soviet hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area and there won't be anything left alive
and they can do that in about four minutes
and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by
they used them in afghanistan did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in
but on a highly populated area like some of the soviet cities would be
with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide
if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the then the nerve gas definitely will get you
the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time
they drink that much fuel
were you have you i take it you haven't spent any time in the military
as a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military
i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in never did make the newspapers but
during that same time frame didn't you get some feeling that i mean they're getting all these weapons and stuff
didn't it
it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff
in any of them since eighty one
it all boils down to whether it's our side their side it's a matter of money to a certain extent
the deal the iraqi's have with the russians was for oil
the ones to the south are more regional conflict
they're not really that worried about
invading north
they're more interested in they've got a screwed up situation i'll give them that
from mexico all the way down into central and south america the situation down there is weird and it's very screwed up
inflation is out of this world and the governments which
our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out
and generally the people are getting screwed and they're tired of it and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism
unfortunately yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard
that's the only drawback that i see with the entire thing gorbachev has made his attempt and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself
yeltsin's in tight with the old guard
so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point
you mean i understand when they pulled the troops out of
or they reduced the number of troops in europe after the berlin wall went down i thought that was great
but by no means do i
endorse or approve pulling everybody out
it may be
a much reduced force than what we used to have over there
but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it's a regional conflict
if
united states is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is
not only does it can talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk it's got to have the stuff to back it back up what it's saying
if you've only got a token force there you can't hold your ground
okay jay i was thinking about this topic and i was remembering that guy that does an advertisement on the radio
about drug testing and marijuana whether or not marijuana causes any trouble or not and he was saying how the train had wrecked
because the guy had been under the influence and he said whether you think you know you might think that it doesn't effect anybody but it does
so i think it's a good idea is what i'm trying to say
yeah
no
i can see now when you've been there a while though they were talking about random testing it seems like if there's no reason to suspect you
that i might be offended if they asked me to come in and be tested you know what i mean
and how often are they doing it
uh-huh
you mean in a year's time or what
uh-huh
because they'd be suspect or what
uh-huh
how do you feel about that
oh that's real good that's real good
drug rehab and they'll send you to it so if they did have a problem they can get over it
i agree with that
uh-huh
hm
did you see that special about all these people that work on the road crews they're putting these bridges up and so many of them had tested positive for drugs and they haven't been putting these bridges together correctly
and like yeah and then on the lines for putting your automobiles together same thing they're under the influence and they're not doing the job right
now that's scary isn't it
uh-huh
uh-huh well i've got an eleven year old son and an eight year old daughter and my son says i don't understand this drug stuff why don't people understand all you have to do is say no
you know and he doesn't realize the pressure that he's going to be under later when his friends start doing this
uh-huh
well i teach and last year a student that i'd had the year before so he would have been in third grade came to school with ice
and i
it i don't i don't know what it is it's supposed to be real inexpensive i know that
and anyway he's like a special ed child
you know and i could see he was probably selling it for these other people and we were doing these posters for drug antidrug campaign and all these little first graders were always drawing these pictures of ice cream trucks
and the teacher started talking to them and they said that they were selling drugs out of ice cream trucks now
uh-huh
uh-huh
so you think we should do this in every profession
uh-huh
uh-huh
what one would be an example like should i say postal service or not i mean are they going to screw up on mail
do i think they should
well see i don't really see the need of it you know
how many elementary school teachers do you think are going to be on drugs
my favorite
well i have several but my think my very favorite is
oh
i've been yeah
my mind just went blank
pros and cons i enjoy that
and i like the bill cosby show
what about you
i haven't seen that i'm going to have to start watching that
yes i watch that occasionally
yeah i enjoy game shows since i work during the day i'm
watch wheel of fortune in the evening
yes it is
uh-huh
are you pretty good
yes do you find you learn a lot on those shows
uh-huh
really
that's good do you ever feel sometimes you'd like to compete in one of those
uh-huh
competing
do you think maybe they pick them out of their audience
uh-huh
do you have any situation comedies that you really like
i saw that one time and i didn't care for that because it seemed like the kids were very obstinate and rude and it was they were trying to teach them manners
did you see that one
and i didn't like that aspect so i and that was the first one i watched but i should probably try to a second time
i don't care for her either
i just i just i but i like evening shade have you watched that lately
it really is
uh-huh
that's great
do you ever think about those twins and triplets that are on those shows you ever think about
how they can teach them at such a young age
yeah
but
oh definitely
engineers running the train was on drugs you know and people were killed in it and yeah when it comes to safety and people being killed i definitely think it should be a requirement you know
you're you know to heck with their rights you know they're interfering with people's rights to live
you know if they're in that type of position and have that much control over people
uh-huh
yes
feeling like that if you know then you can look into a situation and in case there are children involved
uh-huh yeah i can i can understand that i think it is
you know i think it's so sad these crack babies that are now coming into you know grade school elementary school you know that are so
you know they're hard to control they're hard to deal with and yeah i think that would be a good idea
being i'm a contract person with texas instruments and before i could even go to work here i had to be drug tested you know and they do a random drug testing of their employees
far
they don't require everyone to do it they just go through randomly and pick someone and you know and go do it and ti has an excellent
assistance program if you're you know found with drugs they actually give you i think three tries
you know to quit it or get off of it or whatever before you're you know dismissed i mean they work with you and they have a program
that you can go to that the company picks up the tab for and also it's really an excellent program i it seems like the older ones here are in favor of it the younger ones you know course are still
is it
um-hum
uh-huh um-hum
yeah this program you know encompasses everything but you know i thought you know it's not an instant dismissal if you are found to be taking drugs which i think you know is good and it's good on ti's part as i said i think they give you three chances
you know to come to grips with it before you're dismissed
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh well i get a weekend paper as well and in addition to that i get a local weekly i live in suburb of milwaukee and they get they
milwaukee journal because i don't have time to read a paper mostly that's my difficulty i get my news pretty much from the same source as you do although i do listen to npr
which has very good and that's national public radio which has very good coverage of the national and international news i feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well usually
no i'm not actually but i can run my radio in my office i teach at the university and when i'm not
teaching if i choose to have the radio on i can listen to that station so
how are you are you satisfied with the twenty and forty eight hours and the things that you do watch
uh-huh
um-hum
is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is the timely you noting of the events as they happen is that what you feel good about in the news coverage
uh-huh
well i myself the reason why i listen to npr and the reason why i watch macneil lehrer rather than the
than the network news shows at night although i do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which you know carries over a lot of the national news stories is that
the local doesn't either but i feel that macneil lehrer get a little more deeply into some of the issues that are really current
and perhaps newspapers do that but as i said i don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper and frankly when i have read a newspaper i haven't noticed that kind of analysis either
so
there's there is some danger to that of course too because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then
you know how good is it but
i like a little more indepth coverage and i think that's what you're maybe appealing to you too on something like twenty or forty eight hours
um-hum
yeah
i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware that
you know there that an event has occurred
i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture maybe because i'm easily confused by detail i don't know
so
when you have young children right
so those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the tv set for awhile without interruption
oh you do uh-huh
uh-huh when is your good watching time
uh-huh yes
yeah that's what
i have older children and getting dinner on the table i come from the east coast and i was
okay
hm
i like
shows like sitcoms i don't like have a favorite i don't watch a lot of tv but i like
like full house it's a cute show
and like growing pains and
just the cute little comedy shows i don't think i really have favorite
oh yeah that's an that's a good show too
uh-huh
oh yeah i don't know
oh family matters
um-hum
right
yeah
right
oh me neither
oh yeah
what was that
ah
hm
yeah
i don't really watch that too often
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah i used to watch it the general hospital that soap
but
oh yeah
yeah that's true
right they try to get your interest by thinking of something really good but it ends up being really stupid nobody likes it
oh yeah
yeah well that's good kids should be watching you know shows like that they don't need to see all this violence there's enough violence in real life you know let alone
yeah
um-hum
right
yep
yeah i could see that probably does that to a lot of people
hm
once in a while i'll be flipping through the channels and you'll see a really older rerun or something
oh yeah
yeah me too
yeah the black and white show
the private the idea of preserving privacy for the individual because i can't really see why anyone
who has nothing to hide would object
that's of course that is certainly true yeah
um-hum
sure
uh-huh
sure
if you had to have a drug test yeah
um-hum
um-hum
checked out or whatever i but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that i agree that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test
but i would think that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that for example that one positive
would not be accepted as an automatic
reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive dismissal or treatment or whatever
but that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps one or two more stages where further tests could be done
because there are there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with false positives for certain kind of drugs on the other hand
i think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested
because of the of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in industries well the transportation industry for you know specifically but in many cases
whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it's not even going to effect anybody but his you know himself and his own family perhaps
depending on the kind of drug he might be on but and eventually that's going to show up anyway
in the way he works and so on but there's so many things that it would make a difference i guess i
yeah
yeah sure
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
make it difficult enough
yeah
yeah according to what you hear the people who have serious problems i mean we have really i guess we're kind of lucky we really only know of one
young man who who's a they go to our church and it's the son and so on and he was friends with my children
and he's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up having been involved with drugs but
i know of a number of other people who have you know gotten all messed up most of these are young people i work in the education system and so i have a little more contact with that but
the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking and he may never really be
a productive member of society but sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life
because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are almost uncontrollable i mean he puts himself in the hospital
fairly regularly thinking that you know he he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not
i mean he's you know he's so messed up
and this was a nice sweet young man who teenager you know and he's now a young man about twenty i guess who just got
really down the wrong path and you know i don't know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well
it's horrible
well the limits would i think have to do with what i'd alluded to before that there needs to be a further
that one positive on a drug test would not
constitute dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might
have set up for those who genuinely have a problem in other words there needs to be more than
yes right there needs to be more than one test and there needs to be some
some measure of certainty before anything drastic happens there are lots of things that are involved there such as perhaps insurance
you know denial of insurance for someone and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this
that would that you know it would be unfair and people who are on medication for example or
there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination because it makes a bigger problem
so it seems to me that there needs to be some ground you know some rules that protect
i'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested i really don't see why
and
yeah
yeah i don't i don't know why it would be you know
bad to test just and it may be you know it's not feasible to do everyone but certainly random testing the fact that people know that they
yeah would be some measure of protection but the bottom line is that if you're going to stay clean and straight then
you're going to do that because you want to really
yeah
no that's very true
well it sounds like we agree anyway
yeah
i guess if that's all we've done and i guess we've talked long enough
it was nice talking to you
okay bye-bye
i have a dog who is given me a lot of trouble right now
and an aquarium of fish yes it's my dog's playtime in the evening and she thinks i'm neglecting her right now
yes
i have a bichon frise
she's a little bit oh good she's playing with the ball she's a little bitty white dog
right
fluffy kind they sort of look like poodles but they're not
yeah they do and you have to cut it and get it out and
oh she's yeah she's even smaller than lacey is about twelve pounds
oh yeah
i'll bet having your dog and the puppy
i'll bet that's cute
um-hum
oh
yeah
that's not good well my little dog has a playmate from down the street and we have play appointments and play days where
where the two dogs trade houses and play and romp just to keep each other company
yeah this one her playmate's a little
yeah we think it's kind of fun it's better than watching tv to watch the little dogs play
oh yeah well i had that
aquarium first and i got to where i wanted
yeah so
oh you do
oh
oh a parakeet does she talk to you
uh-huh
oh yeah
does she imitate the mocking birds yet
oh
that's the most fun when they hear the mocking birds and then begin to try to imitate the mocking birds and the mocking bird is imitating something else
uh-huh
oh
yeah
you know i used to do that for my dog too to give her some stimulation but she didn't seem to appreciate it she kind of likes the quiet
um-hum
well i thought it i thought it would be and i thought i was being a very good dog mother to do that for her but she didn't seem to appreciate it she likes the quiet
she also likes being able to hear everything that's going on in the neighborhood and i think the radio masked that
yeah
right and look out
and i had all these delusions about how my dog was not going to go in certain rooms of the house
kitty
oh how so
uh-huh
oh
okay we're talking about car repair the last car repair i had done on mine was last february
to have that yeah for the brakes
you know refinished i don't know i don't understand the whole process my personally which is one reason why i don't trust the auto repairmen i guess these car repair places but
i hate to take it anytime because i know they're going you know say oh you need this you need that and everything else in the book
the clutch had broken or something i don't know what was wrong so i took it to a transmission shop nationally recognized name and
they had said
well they he called me back that afternoon and they said oh yeah you need this you need that your transmission's faulty and all this and it was like you know six hundred dollars
and i said wait the car's not worth that much it's an eight year old car and it's not worth that much i'll just have to do later i said i don't do anything with it because i'm not worth that much money on it
and i went there after work my wife and i went there after work and they had the whole thing down and taken apart
yeah so i thought well he'll meet me halfway i'll meet him halfway so i had it all this work done for like two hundred and fifty dollars but still you know the element of trust was gone at that point
yeah it was i'm sure it was
so i got my
transmission fixed with all my clutch
just the other day my clutch cable had popped again and last year i took it my car to a friend of mine to have the oil changed he worked at a at a car lube place
and i asked him if he could adjust the clutch any because it was kind of loose and he looked at it and said sure he pulled the clutch cable out from inside the engine area and
pulled the clip out that was attached to it and put it back further on the cable well it was fine
clip that i had with me i bought an extra one and i just went there and replaced it and was back moving again within three minutes
there i was stuck on the road right in the middle of traffic but i managed to get it going again relatively quickly because i knew i watched what he did and was able to do it real really fast
i don't know i don't have much trust in those people but how about your experiences
yeah
yeah
what kind of car you got
yeah
uh-huh
okay
oh is that right
hum
huh that's odd
that's good to know though
well
yeah i do that myself i mean i take it for places so because i figure for eighteen dollars they'll mess with the oil and they'll mess with getting the things off and all that you know and
it's just it probably costs me at least six seven eight dollars to do it myself i figure for an extra ten dollars let them take care of it
yeah
yeah that's right
who me
oh my clutch has gotten out a couple times and
a chevette
yeah
it just totally disengaged itself and you know of course then we had no way of doing anything at that point
we had to tow it home and all that and it was like good grief and the car was new at that point it was only like a year or so old
and other things were going out on it you know and these repair people say oh you need your this and your that's gone out and it's like good grief i don't even know what they do
so how am i supposed to trust them i don't know
yeah that's all you can do
to have the oil changed at the place across from the ti plant in lewisville
and they told me he says oh your belts are all worn out and they need to be redone
it'd be like sixty dollars
so i thought is that right i don't remember that having seen that they're that bad so i took it to a friend of mine's house and he looked at them he took the belts off and looked at them and he says no they're not cracked or anything they're in pretty good condition all i had to do is tighten them a little bit they need little bit of tightening
there's some belts that needed to be tightened
they you know they were kind of loose and so but these people were telling me that they needed to be replaced
so
yeah
every time my dad had taken his car in to be worked on and they did something with the belts and they when they took the old belt off they cut it
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's what year mine is so that's the problems problem i guess
mine's still running it's twelve years old and it's got seventy two thousand miles on it now so
no not that much
well capital punishment's a hard thing but there've been several
there've been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to
to go along with that being the punishment given to the people
there have been some things you know i mean there's things done that are just
yeah that i don't know how
i don't really think there's any other way to deal with it
yeah i think that that's a really
yeah if it's a it's a it presents a clear and present danger i mean it
is basically set up in lawyers and anybody will tell you that it is set up right now all the laws protect the criminal they're the ones with the rights
they have the right to you know i think i watched something last week
but the victim does not have the right doesn't have the same
doesn't have the same the same emphasis on those things as far as they're concerned so now the accused can ask for delays and extensions and what do they call whatever they call them you know
uh-huh exactly a continuance
they can get continuances on for years before a thing ever comes to trial and that makes the victim suffer more
yeah that too
i think that you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone
has gone through
you know a trial i don't know how to fix it i mean it just seems like there
there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made you know when someone has been
yeah when someone well even when someone has been convicted
and i mean
it's just so
so abundantly clear that they did it
that appealing you know and continuing to appeal like four or five or six times
to have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and all that it's such a waste of time and energy and money
and it just that's what keeps that's what's keeping all the you know the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time like this
oh
well i guess there's extenuating circumstances to anything like that
you know like i could see
killing someone okay i could see that might be a situation where the person could be rehabilitated but i think just out and out murder and i'm talking about
cutting people up
you know where there's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever
that those kinds of things and any kind of violent assault rape included
needs to be addressed in that context
well that bothers me that bothers me a great deal i had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty
and the thing that was the worst about it is that these
that two of these individuals were well all of the individuals involved were very young
one was technically a minor and so he was sent back to mexico he was an illegal alien the other two had lived here they had graduated from high school here and they had told their teachers that
that i mean repeatedly during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to be that they were going to graduate from high school and kill cops
that was what they had told their teachers and so that's what they did and they were they were given i think oh absolutely
he stopped them for a routine traffic violation and they
with it and it was
it was really terrible i mean
i'd seen him like three or four days before that
we'd we've gone out
with he and his wife and that was really disturbing
you know that happened and that these people you know in the in the course of the trial you know came up with all these you know things about well you know they were disadvantaged and all this stuff well nobody's that disadvantaged
and there's just no i mean
no
yeah i think so too and that's
so i do feel strongly about
yeah
yeah
um-hum
the thing that even though juries sometimes make the decisions and still the people nothing ever happens to them
you know they stay in jail they get off time for good behavior and stuff and they get released and they go right back and do it again
yeah
the ghost yes yeah i saw it on campus that's very good yep
right demi moore and whoopi goldberg
right i don't remember his name
yeah
right yeah i thought that it made you think about
you know what happens when you die and everything and is are there really angels and ghost and things and so
yeah
so let's see what else have i seen i saw
have you seen one lately
oh i used to that's a very good show
is that still on
hm
yeah
she got married
gary yes right the longhaired guy
he did oh
an image of him oh like a ghost
oh that's weird
yeah
well yeah i know some of those some of those shows are very moving
i know i really liked some of them there there's one about someone got divorced i don't one of the partners
right
oh they're back together okay
yeah
yeah
yeah well yeah i don't have much time to watch tv i'm a grad student trying to trying to get a phd thesis out so
right but we go out occasionally and
there's some there's some good sort of artsy movies i saw a computer animation festival it was all about computer generated
or else actually it's just sort of animation in general some were computer generated and some were hand drawn cartoon like things
and there's some really neat stuff they can do now with computers and some of the cartoons are just hilarious
but
no it's just there's an annual festival i guess where they
they collect the best entries and they make it into a full length movie and each cartoon is completely independent and separate from everything else
and laugh you know a few minutes
but some tell stories you know some are serious some are funny but there all there all fun to watch
they're full you know they're for adults they're not just kids cartoons they're genuine stories and things
so anyway um-hum
okay so how did this topic get picked did you did it just get picked at random or
i don't know
oh okay
oh okay oh okay yep
all right well nice talking to you all right bye-bye
okay
well let's see well we keep our paper bags lined up in the garage for
glass and
glass and plastics and we make the dump over to the wal-mart bins there as soon as they're full i guess we collect milk cartons and
whatever other plastics are acceptable
no i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet
right well no i haven't seen any so i thought that it all had all been delayed several times so i have no idea what they look like and i'm
kind of anxious to see them
oh right
right
right
oh
oh of course that they did you know actually we had milk delivered to our house
in glass bottles and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house
you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass bottle in there so
yeah
right it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away so i hope that this time it stays i mean it's just
to see stacks and stacks of newspapers
just to the trash is just amazing so
you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them seems like there's a pretty well there's a pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics
so that's kind of encouraging i didn't know you know i didn't know if we started to do that i didn't know what to expect
right
oh right
yeah
right do you know i saw in tom thumb yesterday i saw the return to the small coke bottles
and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not
they were glass they were the glass well let's see they'd be i don't know maybe ten ounce or
six ounce or ten ounce
sort of a small size
sort of a small size and we anyway we just we didn't stop and look them look at them a long time but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack
stick them down you know sort of sort of a basket type thing with the divisions right so i just hadn't seen that in a long time
yeah well
no he doesn't like the paper sacks and but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too he doesn't just
right
that's nice i guess they dump it the same place i wonder where they dump that the same place
no
so hopefully maybe do you have any good advice do you have a car or
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
that's true that's true
um-hum
oh
that's true they do my mom has one
um-hum
oh
yeah
um-hum
and i'd like to get something made in the united states so i would look for that first but
if it turns out that a better price is from say japan like the subarus then i would go for that because the most important thing is price i mean because
um-hum
would you really
yeah
you would think so
um-hum actually i heard really good things about them and it's funny because i just spent last weekend i was down in washington dc visiting my sister and they are everywhere down there it's amazing because you hardly see any of them on the road here in philadelphia but i saw about ten in one weekend
and my sister had gone to the dealership and she was really impressed she the one thing that really impressed her which sounds kind of weird but they actually have women salesmen
it's weird because i mean have you ever seen a woman car salesman
really because i was surprised but and she said they were really nice and
one good thing about the car is it's really hard to dent you know when you're driving a car and you go in a yeah you know most cars in a parking lot like a shopping cart hits it or a car door hits it and you have like these dents well the lady took a hammer to this car and it didn't dent
it's actually supposed to be really good the smaller ones i think around are eight thousand and then it gets up to maybe twelve thousand
so they look really nice
yeah so i don't know maybe that's something to think about because they're supposed to be completely made in the united states not one of these deals where
it says it's made in the united states but the engine is really made in japan and all the parts are made in japan right
i think that's chevrolet
um-hum
that is really nice that's true i don't know anything about them at all do you know anyone who has one
i know
yeah
um-hum
hm
yeah that is really cute that's true
so
well i'm in rotc so i'll be in the army so on active duty so yeah
probably yeah is that a good way to go i guess i don't know which one
uh-huh
really
right
oh i see
well i don't do much of it here i'm from colorado originally and there are no bugs there and i didn't mind getting in the dirt there but boy i'll tell you what once i see these bugs around here i'm just kind of out of it
uh-huh
no i have to you know i have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really
hm
so then
yeah
well i liked it a little bit but i didn't i was working at that time full time and didn't have a lot of time for that and so that i think really
hampered it a little bit
yeah
no
sounds like
oh gosh i'm trying to think well i guess ours have mostly been down at our lake house we built a built a house down on cedar creek lake
so
i guess i'd have to say that because we've kind of let this house go
so we had a shell built and then we did everything else
so it was quite a bit of work
what have you done
uh-huh
oh do you have to have like a retaining wall or
yeah that makes them more difficult we we've just my husband has just repaired ours a lot it really needs to be replaced but we haven't done it
but
anyway well have you done anything else
um-hum
yeah
yeah i you know i'm wondering myself now why i checked this one because my husband is who does all the things like what you're talking about
i haven't
done those things and of course
you know inside stuff
but
now down at the lake we had to like put in floors and put in
wall and you know do the painting and the
cut and make the like the
window sills and
things around the door and all that kind of stuff you know so we did quite a bit
down there that i had never done or we haven't done that much in our own house
yeah we do still have a problem down there we built us a two story house and the bottom story oh it's more like a walk out basement
and it was built with these blocks you know these old gray blocks i think they're called hadite blocks
and we found now with some as much rain as we've had the past year it seeps through
those blocks and comes into the downstairs
and so now we have bought some
water proofing paint
and that's our next project the next time we go down there we've got to paint all those block walls downstairs with this waterproof paint and then hope that maybe that will do it
but what they should've done i think is they should have put plastic or something like that against the house before they put the dirt back you know when it was built
yeah
oh have you ever used that anywhere
now people up north that have basements i think
you and do you know if it if they've had good luck with it
we had a hard time even finding it down here in fact you know you go in a store and they say oh well that we don't have anything like that you know
and then finally we found some one somewhere that was familiar with it probably lived in the north
and well that's encouraging then because i haven't known that many you know there's just not many basements down here are you from around here
oh okay well we're from you know texas too so
but i we have a partner in this deal and he's from the north so he was the one that and it gave us a lot more space you know it gave us double the space
and toward the lake it looks like a two story house you know because it gradually the back it looks like a one story house you know
uh-huh built kind of into a hill a little hill you know
so it was a good idea to give us a lot more space for the money
you were going to talk about child care
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i see how much how much do they charge
uh-huh that seems relatively low by commercial standards isn't it usually about sixty to a hundred a week
right so you've been you've been pleased with the service
uh-huh
how long have you been taking your son there
uh-huh before that did he go somewhere else or
i see
you say you went back to school
oh i see uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh okay yeah i had a student who went there at one time
but i think we're getting off the topic so
and i came out very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers
and that was i thought it was well i mean it is important that people have the opportunity to select the service that they would choose
because a lot of kids are in you know in centers well not really centers but they're being cared for by neighbors and
that's the sort of they prefer it that way the parents do because they know the people who are caring for their kids and they don't have to take them very far
plus about a third of the kids are in church run centers and there was a big church state controversy over whether the government could
fund those are not i think they ultimately decided to but they placed a lot of restrictions on it so it wasn't clear that the church child care centers would want to go to the trouble
still i know a lot of people that do and you know i mean you really wouldn't well i'm on
gee i'm on the benefits committee at the university here and child care is a topic of conversation we the university started up a center this year but it's about two miles away from campus and i'm not sure it's going to be real convenient for people to take their kids over there
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right uh-huh
yeah it's just a lot of time
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i am sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire the building if they would've built a new building then it would've i'm sure it would have cost a lot more than if they if they put it down where they did where real estate's probably cheaper
um-hum
so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which seems most appealing to you
yeah
i think
well
that's right yeah
well i mean they yeah the issue is whether they can take it off of their taxes or whether the government decides which centers are qualified the other
well i think sometime that you get lost in that also
i really do i sometimes think that
a small company may offer
i'm not sure how to put this but that's not
perhaps better one on one relations a big company sometime you can get lost you can you can opportunities do arise
but the competition is much greater for that
opportunity okay
exactly i and i think you get a lot more support from your coworkers and often times in a big company you are asked to go and do things in other areas that
may not be your expertise okay but they require you to do this as their as your stepping stone or whatever you'd care to call it
and that can get to be sometimes very disastrous the consequences of that because people do the best they can
and often times it's not really what
was aimed at in the first place if that makes sense
i can see the results of that
but
yes i i'm i get a lot of gratification from my job some folks i guess they go to work every day and they just go to work for a paycheck every two weeks or every month or whatever
but in my particular job i really enjoy it because i do have an opportunity to help other people do better okay and i really like that
yeah i also teach school at ti at texas instruments i'm a i'm an instructor there so
i teach new
well not new employees but all employee any employees really that care to and we talked about the job opportunity system we have a system where we train people to become what we call automation specialists
and it's a job where if you as a secretary you decide you want to be an automation specialist which is a much higher paying job and a much more technical job
and then you would come to one of our in-house classes
on company time
and or on overtime so we don't involve the production process okay of personnel coming to our classes and we set up and establish these
sixteen and twenty week classes at three hours a day twice a week
for automation specialist training
when you finish hopefully you've acquired enough knowledge to
you know move on into advanced machinery type operations and
and that that's really gratifying to me i
i see a lot of young folks come in and gals and guys both and some gals that say i've i don't know a hammer from a
a nail or a wrench i mean you know and okay that's and that's where we'll start but and we have the other side of the coin where you have you know really advanced people
coming in and top notch
mechanical type people and they want to do better so they of they jump right on it
no that's a fact and
and train and train them we sometimes we have to simply for two reasons one
that we are changing jobs constantly where we are changing our methods of doing things and we are finding more economical methods and more
okay and the other thing is we cannot find the people outside to just walk in off the street and help us
so
but that would be the same in your type of secretarial job i'm that one time we the girls used to have just the typewriter and they
and then they had word processors and now they've got full blown desk top publishers so you know
it is i i'm that amazes me you know people say your job amazes me well my job is really nothing i sit there and i watch some little gal make me all kinds of charts and view foils and graphs and
and it's i it's you know they use laser printers and all that and it's absolutely mind boggling because i could probably turn it on before i get the screen to go completely blank you know and i generally do that
but i was in the same situation i had to learn
i had no knowledge of a computer at all i'm a master
mechanic but not a computer expert
but now i'm in to lotus and word processing and i can hold my own with that
but
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i feel that way and it's a long time to get you know you work for many years with two weeks vacation per year
and then if you have extra days out for
what other reasons there may be an and we try to deal on an individual basis with them but you can be penalized for that an and it it's penalized against your merit increases and et cetera
so i mean you are allowed a certain number of days what we call sick time and personal time off but if you know if you extend beyond those
an and at times we will adjust on a one to one basis
for some unusual circumstances but
to work for a company almost fifteen years with two weeks vacation it seems to me like an awful long time
well no it well in some instances yes
okay in some instances it would be we start with a weeks vacation and then it's two weeks after a year or so
but then that two weeks stays and then it goes to three weeks for a long time and then after fifteen years it's four weeks
but that's still that's a long time you know
i think i would like to see
i would like to see more
well
it's like the kids were talking in california about going to school all year but they have breaks every ninety days or thirty days or ninety days or whatever it is they have two weeks off or a week off or
and they find that that's much
better for them than having the whole summer off an where they're completely bored like the second month into i think i think industry would really
benefit from that
i'm not sure how we would accommodate all of our people being on vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded i guess but so that's a problem you know that's a problem pardon me
well yes that's and that's exactly what we do in many instances you know where our work load increases an and our vacation periods and stuff
of course we have what we called an sds a summer development student program so
we put a lot of school
college
pardon me
yeah
yeah they work for us and they go to school back in the fall
and hopefully when they get out of college they consider us to come on full-time
and they've established themselves with a work pattern an and the you know they're familiar to our
our ways and stuff and they're on our records and
we find that that's very helpful
you sound like a very young person
i
well i guess without a doubt we'd have to say automobiles although i suppose manufacturing contributes quite a bit to air pollution
yeah you know i'm wondering course freon is eating away at our
what you call that layer there ozone layer
i wonder when they're gonna what they'll be able to use in place of freon
well actually you know that is the way a refrigerator works
well basically what happens is you have to have some form of heat
be it electrical as in your home refrigerator or propane as the one on the ship that you said
you had and somehow heat must be created that freon
oh i'm not exactly sure what happens but apparently it expands in the heat and
in the process of expanding it goes through cooler coils and whatnot and it becomes ice cold
oh yes freon's freon is in a closed circuit
that's why our present day refrigerants systems are not dangerous unless the lines are broken
well did you ever see what happens when they replace the or replenish the freon in your automobile air conditioner
i mean there's a lot of it is turned out into the atmosphere
and i understand now i don't know if it's international or just here in texas or what but
service stations are going to require to have a special device
to catch this freon as it is expelled the excess freon
and therefore you won't be able to just pull in anywhere to or you wouldn't even be able to do it yourself at home
no that's true
you know i can remember as a child
spending summers at my grandfather's place and i'd be running around with nothing but a bathing suit
no shoes socks shirts or anything
i mean from dawn till dusk
and i develop a nice tan but my gosh it never had to worry about skin cancer
or for that matter you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably clear and get a drink of water without worrying
about catching some disease
hm yeah
i tell you funny thing happened to me with polluted water
ti sent me up on a trip to wyoming i think it was and i was out in this little
town kind of backwoods town you know where big night on the town is going down watching the traffic light change
but i checked into a motel
and after i signed in and everything why the clerk told me don't drink the water
it's contaminated
he said now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests but unfortunately we're out of it right now but as soon as we get it
i'll see that you get a bottle of it
well the next morning i got up the water had not been delivered yet and would you believe it i brushed my teeth with coca-cola
oh well they had this
it's some kind of a bacteria or carried by animals
and it they got their water from this beautiful mountain river
well maybe not quite a river but a little bigger than a stream
but this bacteria had penetrated their entire
pipe system or water system
and they tried flushing it out they couldn't get rid of it
i've often wondered now this is years ago and i've often wondered what they ever did course the oh was a beautiful mountain stream
bubbling nicely you know the which is what purifies water when it bubbles
yes and yet even at that it was still contaminated
yeah yes
well i'm beginning to wonder too i mean you you're always hearing stories about well the government okayed this
then all of a sudden you turn around and
my gosh it's okay for to doing it this way but if you turn around and do it that way it's dangerous
as a matter of fact i did
neither have i
yeah
i've often wondered about the la now that's supposed to be about the worst city in the country i guess for
air pollution
yeah um-hum
well
they used to do it down in florida now i lived down there for ten years
no they did away with it because they found out that
the people that were doing it was just a racket to them
yeah
um-hum well now here's another thing diesels
diesel engines are the worst
and yet they haven't done a thing to them
uh-huh yeah tell me about it i just got rid of a diesel engine escort
well i had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up on me here a few weeks ago
is that right well
uh-huh well now there was at one time
as a matter of fact it may have been buick i think because i think it was gm that came out with a
diesel engine that was converted from a gas engine
and they used the same pistons and cylinders and whatnot but all they did was change the
the induction ports and etcetera whatever needed to be changed over
and although they were it seemed practical at the time they were nothing but a headache
and they did finally did away with them and went to a straight diesel
well now course in california they're they have much stricter codes than we have elsewhere
now could be that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in california
i don't know what it is precisely but they're doing they do something
a little more stricter than we do
where in california you live
okay i was down that way once but i don't think i remember that is it on the coast
i went all the way down to imperial beach once that's far as i went
uh-huh
yes i guess we're gonna talk about camping is that right
okay
well yeah my wife and i like to camp usually just on short trips like a weekend or long weekend
and we generally go to state or national parks
well texas has a pretty nice system of state parks we've got state parks just all over the place on different kinds of terrain and most of them
well texas has every thing from desert to swamp so i don't think they have too many
now we may do some camping in arizona though i've got my brother and sister and father all live in sedonia now sedonia yeah
what is it
mayer
oh yeah
i think i remember going through there is that between prescott and jerome or over the other way
uh-huh well it be
yeah i think i do remember a little wide place in the road called mayer well anyway they everybody there says that you know there are places you can camp right around sedonia there are
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well we do we like actually we like to get off where there aren't too many people around
we did find a nice prospect down on the gulf
there's a national wildlife refuge called urandus i don't know if you've heard of it that's where the whooping cranes go in the winter or at least where a lot of them go
and there's and island right off that called matagorda and you can take a ferry boat out there and it's completely pretty much anyway complete wilderness island
but then you can take a take a little bus across the island to the to the gulf side rather than the bay side and
it's really nice out there lots of sea birds
uh-huh
yeah well i sort of like to feel less tied down rather than more tied down when i go camping and
uh-huh
well i really like arizona i like couple times this last year i've made it up to jerome just to enjoy the altitude and everything and it's really
neat up there somehow
i met the town historian
oh okay i'm in garland so well i'm in dallas right now but i'm living in garland
well i don't know if you know but garland has got a real big recycling center
that in fact we went to yesterday you drive up and you take the stuff out of your trunk and they have different bins for the different materials like
clear glass and colored glass and plastics and they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom
we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them
does dallas have a curbside recycling program yet
oh okay
yeah
hum
yeah like soda bottles are one type of plastic and milk jugs are one type of plastic you can it's it'll
most of the recyclable containers have a little symbol on the bottom with little with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three
it's just different kind of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic know that's what the different types are
yeah
yeah yes i know there's a long scientific name but it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff i like
i don't know if they do it all over but our kroger does a newspaper recycling every saturday you can drive up and they have one of the clerks out there no the bag boys out there
that will take the papers newspaper out of your car and they'll put it in their little bin
and they do the recycling i mean they collect the newspapers and their the plastic grocery bags
yeah in fact i have one today it's um-hum the only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom
they did a program or the one of their articles was on recycling and or it was actually on a town that has a dump that
they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there they have made so much money from that
that they built they bought a brand new fire engine and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough so they mought bought a new or built a new one paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill
they have built up one mountain they call it mount trashmore they built up one mountain covered it with grass and put ski lifts on it and in the winter they put snow on it and they charge to ski on it
so the city gets the money from that they built a golf course at the bottom and they get the money from that it's like that's it's a it's riverview ohio or some place up there
but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea they i mean their city hall looked better it was nicer than dallas' and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city
and they like the trash so i like well
but i thought that was pretty neat it would be nice if more communities could do that but you have to know from beginning and you have to have the space to do it and
this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling
oh it's we i know like i said i've got a two year old and a four year old and that's
my daughter thinks that anytime she sees newspapers bundled up they're being recycled so it's like well no honey so that like so that was one reason we went to show her
what people did with their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans and you make them into new things and you get the paper all wet and you make it into new paper and
well yeah that was the her next question was how do you grow paper
was like well from trees that's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees
but at least she knows that is something that people need to be doing and she got our baby sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about so i guess
is that it
okay start them off
oh yeah
well i don't know what your age is but i know when i was growing up that
communism course the big threat of communism mccarthyism back in the fifties and
and everything there we lived our whole life under the fear of communism was going to get us and now
communism is no more
so that makes a huge difference to us
pardon me
i was born in forty seven so i've got a couple years on you and i can tell you that things
things have changed a tremendous amount for women in the world
since i you know first started
i'm not sure i i'm not sure they're better
that's true
yeah i feel sorry for women who truly do wish to
kind of follow the older tradition and stay home and raise their family take care of the kids and people say what you don't work
well yes i work all day long thank you very much
yeah the cost the cost of living has gone
just sky rocketed
what do you think as far as the
social morals the morals of people today as opposed to
hum
i really do i feel you know i look back and i have two children i have a daughter who's fifteen and my son is twenty
and i mean it's very scary because they are living in a totally different time with totally different fears
than i grew up in
you know
five years ago
even ten years ago before the threat of aids entered
i think things were people were even possibly more promiscuous
because you know well it was live and let live and everybody have a good time and we won't even think about the consequences
i think the seventies maybe even the well in the eighties we started getting a
and i don't know i think there may even be a turnabout
in the nineties not immediately
but as people become more and more
terrified of the aids virus
i think they're going to pull back sexually
i think they're going to pull back and we may find the pendulum swings you know
back the other way somewhat
i think we it has to
do you have children
you're single then you are in the midst of this
yeah it
it's a different world for us
no
just three minutes
oh yeah it's been three minutes dear
okay i've enjoyed talking to you
oh
do you y'all do you get together with family reunions or
oh that will be fun if you haven't done it in a while
oh where is your family from
so you are going to have to go there
yeah
oh
yeah
my family is from kentucky most of them is down there
i have got an uncle in louisiana and another sister here in texas
we did when i was growing up it was every summer we got together now my grandmother just passed away this last year so
you know she was
uh-huh
yeah
well it
it sure does
well we in kentucky it wasn't hard because everybody lives so close together we just did it word by you know by word of mouth
you know
my uncle in louisiana he is the only one that
you know had to travel
we are just scattered all over the place so it is going to be hard this time but we have got a huge family
yeah because it is so fun i mean
we my mother has got like thirteen brothers and sisters
yeah it we just we had two baseball bleachers full of people and there are still about eight or six eight or ten people taking pictures
yes and it was just the last time we had one it was so fun
yeah
we have always had ours in a park or something but it's always been the same park and there is nothing really special there only thing is it is big and it is open
um-hum
uh-huh in missouri
well that was part of the problem with
the ones we have now the kids would sneak off and we were just being kids and we found what we thought was just an old water hole so we was going swimming
and like i said we was just stupid kids we was like eight and ten years old
kyle don't i have got a four year old
yeah but if we could have gotten it by a lake or something i thought that would have been much better
yes i remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it we were all kids anyway
oh but i love it all the different foods because that yeah
that's the yeah
so how long did you say it has been since you all had one
yeah
well i have been married almost five
so i guess it has been seven years since we have had one and since then we've lost
oh well just our grandmother that is surprising
um-hum
oh if i can ever get down to kentucky it has been like four years since i have been home
yeah that is the reason that is the reason i don't i would get on a bus any day by myself but i won't do it with the babies
because i have got a four month old and a four year old
so i am just starting
i won't be adding any more to the family reunion
yeah they are good kids though
so i am not too upset
anyways i've enjoyed talking to you
all right all right you too bye-bye
do you do you do you do your own gardening
huh see i got mine in well let's see i put in pepper plants this weekend
and
yeah i got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen and
i enjoy tinkering with it you know it's pretty hot down here during the summer we hit you know a hundred and two sometimes so you know we don't do too much during the summer as far as tomatoes and stuff like that but
yeah i can usually i can put in oh probably mid march i can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that
but then i have to wait for my tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks
as soon as we're sure we're not going to have another freeze then i'll finish it
yeah we've had just a few you know that freezes a little here and there but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of april and it's pretty tough
no i work
i'm only forty years old i have to work
well
i really enjoy it gives me time outdoors and you know i'm a golfer but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house and i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days and
getting ready to start for the spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn i usually have a pretty nice lawn it's a lot of work you know but it's
yeah it is
uh-huh
oh yeah
we're going through that we going through the dust storms down here now so
but i what i did with my garden is i have a two by six frame that's five by ten i have two of them sitting side by side
and then i put like a black plastic it's really not a black plastic it they call it weedex and i put that down and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that
and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times and i only have to water about two hours a week
and it's pretty nice especially during the summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting
oh
oh you have a spring how nice
uh-huh
but you actually enjoy it huh
get out there on your hands and knees and crawl around
with the worms yeah i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs and i haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet
yeah i try to
no i try not to use any insecticides at all i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn but i sometimes i can't manage
yeah
yeah
well mine's full of dandelions now so
no i never have i don't know how to prepare them
no huh-uh
really
huh i've never eaten dandelions now i've tried dandelion wine
but i've never tried any dandelions just to eat
yeah
all right
yeah
i'll try that i sure will
oh
oh
yeah oh
so you all are into
so you all are into the lawn big time huh
yeah i only got well i guess i got my whole section of my house is probably maybe a tenth of an acre
and i have a pretty nice backyard and you know i've got enough room to throw horseshoes you know couple of other odds and ends
no and it's nice i'm just inside the city limits i'm probably a mile and a half inside the city limits and i'm only a mile and a half from work
yeah it's pretty nice
i have the room outside i need and i don't really have all the room in the house i need but
no
yeah i have a question to ask you about gardening though you know those what are they called the are they called roly-poly bugs that's what my son calls them anyway
roly-poly bugs the ones that roll up in a ball
i don't know what they're called
they look like they've got yeah no it's not like a no
you find them under bricks and all that stuff where it's moist
and if you touch them they roll up in a ball
i don't know what they call them but i'm plagued with those things down here and i haven't figured out i even called the nursery either though see
i don't know
yeah under bricks or under
no
no they're not real hard
they're like a water bug of sorts i don't know what they called them yeah when you touch them they roll up
but i'm plagued with those
you know i think it's probably because we're in more of a tempered zone you know we don't really we only freeze down here in january and february at the most you know
yeah i got fire ants too
and you spray in one part of your lawn and they just move to another part so you got to spray your whole yard and then
your neighbor gets them and then he sprays his yard and you get them back again so yeah but we're not doing too bad down here really you know the daffodils are out and
yeah
yeah
yeah see mine are up and bloomed already
and they sure are pretty i like them and the snap dragons are starting to come up
yeah and then in my back flower bed i have
tiger lilies
and they bloom in you know late june mid july and they're yeah they are they're real nice but they're nice and green now you know they're up above a foot maybe eighteen inches
they come up real pretty every year no problem
is it still pretty cool up there yeah
well do you all have a what kind of grass do you grow up there do you grow bermuda or rye or
okay
yeah see we i have bermuda in my yard now i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there but
bermuda seems to be yeah bermuda seems to do pretty good down here
there is a group in town called nacogdoches recycles that will meet i believe it's once a month at the park and you can take plastics papers
or bottles
but it's up to you to collect them it's up to you to get them down there and then what they do with them i don't know
there isn't any somebody had talked once before to city council meeting about maybe having different colored waste cans
uh-huh because they do that in palestine and nobody wanted to go for that they were gonna charge a little extra on the bill and nobody wanted to do that
and i save aluminum cans and
to take those to the to the closest place is about
it's about thirty minutes away
yeah and it and the last time we took some things
the price is not really
yeah because by the time and you save them and squish them and
and that's the bad thing about it and newspapers we started saving newspapers and stuff well they just packed up and i have cats well they had a field day
destroyed those
mine have some kind of paper thing oh yes any kind of cardboard and paper and they just tear it up
um-hum both
i don't know what it is
i don't know what it is and you can't leave the mail don't i don't leave the mail on the coffee table or it's chewed up
and it was just really one i've got i've got several and one in particular but then she kind of showed the other ones what was going on
uh-huh so now it's just a big play time
yeah i think if they would make it a little more convenient for us everybody would
that's true
oh i know and we take the little plastic bags back to the to the grocery store
uh-huh
but as far as bottles and things go there isn't any place any close
yeah
um-hum
it really is
and i save all the little condiments and things and i
yeah things that i normally threw out because they just give you ton and now i've got a big basket full in the refrigerator
exactly they'll say do you want any no i do not
but try and we have a lot of newspapers and magazines and things like that but
that's
yeah and i've got a tiny little kitchen so the option of you know some people will maybe have four bins one for your garbage and then i have no room
yeah i have i have room enough for one garbage can and that it is
yeah
my dress for work most of the time is rather comfortable and casual
and a suit and all of that sort of thing but when i don't need to dress up for a meeting or a service of some sort i don't
yes
well around there you can probably wear t-shirts and other things but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and coats
the wind will take away a lot of body heat
no i'm not stuck with that kind of a situation
as i say unless it happens to be now yesterday i had to dress up and be more formal because i had a formal meeting at noon time
but then i can go home later in the day and be a little more casual
and then if i have a meeting of people that i know i can be very casual in the evening
yeah that's around here in a lot of places that's the way it is i mean there are expected dress codes
and the people need to follow that i think years ago i used to be far more committed to the idea of a dress code but i've
relaxed a lot more as i've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself
you mean you don't need to wear little old house dresses anymore
that's a good idea that's a good idea
but yeah what kind what kind of shoes do they wear down there
um-hum
we can wear pretty much that although tennis shoes are kind of out in almost every situation
unless you wanna look like a gook
a lot different
you too and thank you for calling um-hum bye
oh i guess mostly really i get the
i guess the headlines on the news and then i read the newspaper for a little more detail
i used to take some news magazines but i found that i just didn't have enough time to really read them
yeah to get my money's worth out of it you know i'd
i'd oh i was taking newsweek for a long time and i'd read it a little bit and put it back for a while and you know first thing you know i'm reading a three week old news magazine
but i do read the paper just oh just about every day
um-hum
yeah
yeah i'm i like to watch the news if i really know that something's going on because like i say you can kind of get the headlines and a pretty quick thumbnail sketch of what's going on
but then i like the paper because you do get more detail
oh i tell you
yeah i think it does i tell you it's really interesting when
when you are personally involved or personally see something that happened and then gets reported on later
it's you know i've kind of been in that situation a couple of times and it's
it's interesting to see how the how the reporters and how the other people you know yeah how they saw it as opposed to how you saw it
and sometimes it's you know sometimes it's just like i saw it and then again sometimes it's not
yeah
yeah but it's i don't know it's you know the problem is you really don't know i think so many times if the coverage is accurate or it fair
and that's the problem i guess
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah
yeah it's interesting to hear from the experts you know the so-called experts but i think sometimes they tend to go a little overboard
uh-huh
yeah it's kind of funny we were we were kind of discussing that at work one day and you know the introduction to the experts that they have you know this is mister jones he's been working on this project for thirty years you know he knows all there is to know about it
and we just kind of looked around at our project at ti and you know we've got people that have been on the project for a long time that you know don't know the first thing about what's going on
so we're kind of quoting those guys and you know and everybody's having a good time with it
so that just you know that's a little lesson on how the experts can be
but i
oh yeah
yeah
yeah the media was more mobilized than the military was i think
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well you know the situation the way it was there for a while you know you had you had tv reports coming out of baghdad and that's
to me that's unheard of you know that's crazy you
no huh-uh
yeah because here we are at all out war with a country and we've got our own people right in the heart of that country you know right in the area that we're trying to blow out
yeah
oh yeah
well the some of them
no huh-uh
yeah there's not much we can do
yeah
yeah
oh yeah really like i say you know if they've had enough ample time to get out and then they don't then you know that's their own problem you know whether it's
yeah that's yeah that's exactly right you know because that's exactly what we're doing
but no it's
there's a lot of lot of sources for news and i guess a lot of sources of news there just
oh you know news people every where all over it's just amazing
um-hum
yeah
yeah it's you know some of the stuff i don't i don't feel the need
some of the news items i guess is what i'm saying i don't feel like are really newsworthy you know the personal tragedies and that kind of things but
you know but oh the big disasters and the big natural disasters and stuff yeah that's news but
yeah that
yeah
oh yeah that's just that's strictly national inquirer stuff you know and i don't care a thing about that i haven't read anything about it or even watched anything about it
but
yeah
all right you too all right you too we'll see you later bye-bye
hey larry what is the last home repair job you did
had the either one
um-hum
how old is your house
well that's not that old of a house but things do change from time to time don't they
y'all have basements in pennsylvania don't you
we don't have basements in texas unless it's an a very unusual situation
no we build them on pier and beams as up for few years back and then what's popular now is just called a slab
and we don't have snow to speak of
if it snows in dallas we don't go to work and wait for it to melt and at lunch we have the day off you know it i'm serious we just we don't have any snow plows
the last home project i guess well a year and a half ago we bought a house that had laid vacant for about two years and had been
well sad situation estate thing and we've kind of put the whole thing back together the biggest thing i did was refenced and redecked in the back
are you kidding
i'd rather sell an extra insurance policy than use a hammer and a nail it wouldn't be straight anyway
let's see and we found a part time fireman and policeman and in their so called spare time they moonlight
and we get a lot better price than trying to use a professional yellow page advertised
personnel
um-hum
have you heard of that continuous guttering they have now
no kidding
were you were you did they make it right there on your property
oh okay
we got guttering bids we finally repaired briefly what we've got for less than a hundred bucks those guys were gonna sell me a three thousand
go ahead and they talked about bringing a machine out and just making it right there in the front yard and putting it up as they make it so i've never seen one
i just thought of a project i did my wife wanted an island in the kitchen
well we the house isn't that new so i built a
a
a table
from the local hardware store we have a outfit called home depot which is probably local down here but i ordered a formica top with rounded corners
and then they have premade and bevelled legs and braces and so i simply took my counter top and put legs on it and braces and put it together and
yeah had somebody come through and he said my gosh if you had bought that at a store it'd been seven hundred and fifty dollars and i got out for about a hundred and forty five i think
so i was happy
um-hum
how nice
are y'all in the mountains
okay
we've got a home and very large front and back yard we had a lot of dallas grass what they call dallas grass
um-hum
what flowers does she like
um-hum yeah they climb too
do you have a problem with any type of insects or gophers or anything
if you sprinkle lime on your young plants before they get too big that should help that
yeah that works that's kind of hard to get a hold of sometimes
what vegetables do you grow the most
do you have jalapenos
um-hum
do you have the small red ones cayenne
i've heard of the chili but i've never heard of the pequine what are they are they green red and yellow what
um-hum
what do you use them for mainly
well i don't know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a way we budget our money apparently
my wife
has so much you know gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and
we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i you know i have a set amount that i save every month
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
um-hum
uh-huh
right
well i found that you know as i've gotten older i'm in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to have a very strict budget i had four kids and
you know we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and
i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know -ill come up every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance
every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but
what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i'll just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total
and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside
and i guess that's a way of budgeting
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too
you know we've got two cars my wife has a car and i and i like to drive a pick up truck so
we're on a schedule where i try every three or four years to buy a new one and you know i'm constantly making car payments but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments
so you know i get one paid for and actually i'm saving up for another one besides so
it's
you know it's kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that
you're not paying for two at the same time i guess what i'm saying
well i've thought about it but leasing wouldn't i you know i don't use it for my business my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so
yeah i guess
uh-huh
right
yeah you're right i have been know to keep
trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put stuff into them you know
uh-huh
um-hum
those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say
so that it doesn't kill you all in one month
so what is your opinion on drug testing
well yeah you're it it's not just a you're talking about company's liability if the company is liable for something that a employee does while under the influence of
of a drug you know then by all means they should have the right to
to
to minimize their liability and there's also the case about just health and welfare of the employees
if a company has a healthy work force their insurance rates are low and not only not only they low there's all sorts of a of a benefits
financial benefits associated with having you know having people file fewer claims being sick
then there's the whole question that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is gonna be more healthy i don't think anybody would argue with that
right
right
well the
right the question becomes what do you do about somebody who testses who test positive
that's where the real sticking point comes in it's not i don't think there's any problem with testing people it's what do you do with the information
right
right well yeah i think clearly the person who is the line manager of the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing that should go to an entirely different
agency within the corporation
it's a local radio station it's called
klif cliff
no
well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news
yeah we have a well we have dallas morning news which is the big paper in dallas we read it i read it pretty much
from cover to cover
and so we really only have one dallas newspaper and one fort worth newspaper
financial trouble
oh when did it happen
i guess they closed down about three months ago
so how do you keep up
yes they're very voluminous
so there really is only one major la newspaper now
yeah
because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the dallas morning news
now they have started here running a three day or three times a week plano section
and it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in plano
but it's still not an awful lot of news
of course they tend to cover the county and we're not in dallas county so they tend to ignore places outside of the county
yeah
yeah
well it's funny when i tried to make the call the other days i thought i hadn't seen anything since dances with wolves but today i went to see regarding with henry
it was really good we jeff warner just got out of the hospital and jeff and deanna went and
another friend in the neighborhood and we all liked it we had both moms and fifteen year olds and a twelve year old and everyone enjoyed it and
yeah
well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see and so since he had this friend up from houston
yeah
oh was that good
oh
oh well good i'm glad to hear that because they
uh-huh
well i don't i don't know if you got to see weekend at bernie's that was out a couple of year's ago they had a free showing at the berkeley united artist
and i don't know who was here or whether jay just called a friend and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in but we thought we'd try it you know free movie
it was so funny and it sounds like what you were just describing soapdish too i mean we just we hurt by the time we came out and the whole theater was hysterical and it's just it's just goofy i mean it's
if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on tv i would think
because it's just a fun summer light comedy make your cheeks hurt laughing especially in the theater it was contagious you know i imagine the way soapdish was but with everyone laughing
yeah
oh gosh
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
try and find time it's hard
with jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go and
and that's what he would have liked to have seen regarding henry too but knew that
we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful we're really enjoying it but some of the different things we're doing
when the choir group went to see backdraft and they thought that was
it was funny cause he sounded like the critics he said you know the plot line and the characters you know aren't real big but the fire scenes and the you know that action part is fantastic
but he thought robin hood was great it was real different then you'd expect but he enjoyed it and so
yeah me too and yeah i really like him a lot which is why dances with wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months but it was i
in fact a friend from germany was visiting in march and we wanted we didn't ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it we were going to sit through it again because we really wanted him to see it too
i just thought that was terrific and i really enjoy harrison ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see
and he's very good in regarding henry that's not an easy part to play i don't think
uh-huh
a few minor repairs but i haven't bought anything of any consequences other than clothes and things and i will be in the very near future i'm gonna be buying a big computer and
so i've been i've been studying these things but i haven't had to return too many things i
i try to be very careful when i pick up something and look it over to make sure that it looks like it's going to work
and
i think it really turns down to
picking who you want to buy from and i hate to say it but the electronics devices that i buy the ones in japan in generally
are much higher quality from working
you that's right you were speaking of that about a week ago i bought myself a new digital watch
that was made in china
works just fine and it cost me four dollars
yes it's amazing isn't it
yes
uh-huh
that's right and that's been really way it's been for me for the last five or six years i returned a tv set to be repaired but the problem was that we had a lightning storm and
the lightning flashed in through the power and hurt something in it so it wasn't the set's fault at all it was just one of those circumstances
no
so it's nice but i know how it is if you're gonna take care of texas you have to live in texas i suppose
yeah
of stores that have huge quantities of clothes and articles and you know we've got wal-marts and gee bees and a whole bunch of things and
i don't know how we can support all of those things and the and the only way they can stay alive is to buy cheaper products so they can put them on the market cheaper for the public
and when that happens more of those products are likely to have inferior working ability and that's when you have to start returning them
so
yeah
if it looks beautiful and it's well made but people can't afford it
huh
yes
do you
hum
actually i had some i bought a water softener for my home
and i didn't have to return it but it didn't work well and i finally had to have the company come out and to check it out so i did have that problem
and it was a i think it was more of the installation was part of the problem than the machine itself
i think they're kind of ambivalent really
i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know
we're we don't know half the time we don't know who to support
that and you know maybe it's maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with
countries like that depend on us so much without you know just telling them running their country for them but
yeah it worries me that the economy of so many countries in south america and central america
depend on something that damages people like the you know like cocaine from columbia and
you know of course i i'm sure we have some enemies down there who would wouldn't care what happened to us but
the competing factions in a lot of those countries and i mean they've been hammering tongs for the last you know ten centuries
and it's still going on and
we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us i think sometimes
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah kind of nationalized it
for himself
yeah
dictator yeah
and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing it just
you know unstable
well i think it's long overdue i just you know there's so much difference in the economies of the two countries i i'm not you know i have a problem
with whether it's gonna work or not you know
there's
it seems like there's
in foreign policy a lot of the times
yeah
yeah
you know has a lot
i'm not
think that it really does much good as it as a deterrent the old thing in terms of the biggest day for pickpockets was at the when they were hanging pickpockets but in public but
on the other hand it the it seems like that there just aren't are
some crimes and some lives that there's no other at least emotional reaction to it what about you
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
utah have capital punishment
yeah
yeah
at this point it's fairly obvious that it was a girl was killed at a high school and it was pretty obvious that the
yeah
yeah
well now in utah what's the method it is it firing squad or what huh
yes
yes i think it's important that we
either make a special tax for it or implement the money toward that away from other areas
it's going to be such an amazing
insurmountable you can't even imagine the cost it's going to cost to take care of these people
and if they can find a resource of course they can cut the pain and suffering but if anything the cost
yes i do
oh well cancer the numbers are larger
however aids has the opportunity to become to become larger than cancer within a very quick time
um-hum
um-hum i agree
um-hum
um-hum
i think it's because the sheer numbers i really think it's that
it is
aids is a major topic right now it's trendy
in the news it's in everybody's point of view
but until you've really worked with it and seen it
that's the difference it is it is
um-hum
um-hum
right
well i remember the first time i worked with an aids patient i was terrified i have to admit it
and i know educationally wise everything i'm supposed to know
and it still scared me
that's true but you'd be surprised how many nurses don't
it
i'm not kidding i
i work in a public a county hospital and well first of all most of those nurses there are lvns because the pay is bad for them
and they don't they don't have many rns and very few bsns
so
the care is shoddy yes
the compassion is low the hours are long and there's a lot of people
so they tend to isolate them and leave them
for a large amount
huh
yes they're in isolation
they certainly are
they definitely do they definitely do
i know
and we our debt i i'm just so concerned
i know
where are they spending it i know
who are i mean where are they spending this money you know
me either
um-hum
yes we do yes we do
i
that's exactly what i was going to say i don't really know how much we're spending it may be one of those things that takes twenty years to find anyway or fifty
oh i know
i don't know
hi
yeah
right yeah that's the
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah
oh that's good
yeah well it's so far as vegetable gardening is concerned it has been many years since i've tried any of that i we did have we've been in our house where we're located now for about fifteen years
and about eight nine
about nine years ago i guess we put a swimming pool in our backyard
so our gardening is pretty much limited to
plants you know shrubs and trees that kind of gardening
i
in the years that i did have vegetable gardens there were you know there were times when i had really good gardens and there were times when they just they weren't very good at all and i guess the soil and the and the bugs together
um-hum yeah i wouldn't doubt that
i always like to try to grow squash and the squash bugs would just go crazy
and
and in my experience with tomatoes was that if i got tomatoes at all they usually got sun blisters you know or it would rain on them and they would bust open you know when the heat hit them
but
yeah but there were you know there were years i grew the little plum salad type tomatoes quite a bit and had real good luck with those
yeah and i still occasionally will grow jalapeno peppers we like jalapenos and they grow real well too now you can just stick one of those anywhere
one of the things that we're doing talking about lawns and shrubs we have a live oak tree in our front yard
and we just have more trouble getting grass to grow underneath that
and we're in the process or at least in the planning stage of putting in a bed around that oak tree
right yeah we're going to just have a ground you know put ground cover and you know maybe a few low plants under there
right
and
right
right we
we brought some plants out we're from both from east texas and we brought some plants in from there and one of the things that we brought unintentionally was violets
which is almost like a ground cover
and they really they really spread out and grow pretty rapidly when they you know when they're growing well
but
but they are i guess not an annual but a
they volunteer to come back every year but they do die off during the winter i've forgotten what the term is for that
but they do die back during the winter so that you know they are not really very satisfactory for a you know for a full ground cover because of that
but
um-hum
yeah i don't i'm not familiar with that pear tree but it's a non bearing pear is that right yeah
and then the of course the leaves drop off during the winter right so
yeah we have we've had real good luck with and again these are like volunteer trees that we transplanted from east texas but we've got a couple well we did buy one though we have a couple of red bud trees
and we've got one of those on our patio we've got a lot of rock and around in our one area of our patio
and we brought a red bud tree in and it has done very well it has a little larger leaf than
maybe even than a pear tree i know it's got larger leaves than a plum tree has
the leaves are probably oh four inches or so in diameter
and
you know makes a pretty good tree
it has of course during the early spring it has the red you know the red flowers that are really pretty
the only problem with it is it does have a seed pod you know a little it's a little flat bean type seed pod
that will drop off you know when they start drying out so there's a little bit of clean up work for that
yeah always it's
with our in our case it's fairly close to our swimming pool
and so the flowers blow in there they don't drop in but they blow into the swimming pool so there's a good bit of cleanup you know in the swimming pool from that but it's you know it's not too bad even at that so
right and
but yeah we we've really enjoyed that the live oak tree that we have is in the front and of course the live oak is
it's susceptible to bending by the wind it leans away from the predominant wind direction
and i think i think you'll find that we also have an apple tree in our side yard and it does the same thing the -ly winds
which are predominant you know during the growing season make both of those trees lean
toward the northeast
and so it's but that's the live oak tree that's you'll find that pretty much anywhere that there are if there's a grove of live oaks growing they're going to be leaning away from the you know the direction of the wind
if you
if you go down along the texas coast there a lot of them grow you know down there and you'll see them and there'll just be like twenty five or thirty of them growing real close together and they'll all every one of them be leaning away from away from the from the water mostly
yeah
right the
what kind of grasses are you growing
um-hum
yeah
saint right
hm
right
yeah what you what you will find with the saint augustine grass is it's very susceptible to both diseases and to grub worms
you know the grub worm is the larva of the june beetle
the june bug beetle and the grub worms in the late spring the beetles come in and they lay their eggs in the grass
and then the grub worms come out in the larva stage and they eat the grass off at the roots they eat the roots of the grass off
and we had saint augustine in our yard before i mean before we the house we were in before and one year all of the saint augustine in our backyard
well i do love to fish
well i hope it is there's not a whole lot of different kinds
i don't do a lot of deep sea fishing i because i get seasick but we have a lot of lakes here in this area
and i do a lot of fishing for bass we have a lot of couple of lakes in our area that are just filled with good sized bass
and then when i get tired of them outwitting me i fish for catfish
and we use worms and shiners which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows and then i also use spinner baits and plastic worms
it all depends on what i'm fishing for
and the time of day
i do there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here and
it's very convenient on afternoons when i wanna just get away and sit and think fishing's a good way to do that and i have a lot of friends who like to go fishing
no i don't i have a friend who has a little inflatable raft and we use that sometimes
um-hum
right that's the same way here isn't it you have to get back in the sticks in the
right
oh
we don't have
we don't have a big problem with turtles but
we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes
and i
well i can't think of a time that i've been fishing that i haven't run into one or two of them
no we occasionally i'll catch an eel on an on a hook but
never the snakes they just kind of
we have a lot of cottonmouth and so yes they are definitely
and they live in the shallow little coves that i like to fish in so i see them swimming by every once in a while
yeah they can they're certainly ugly
yeah
definitely
do you have bass
right well that's pretty much the same way here i
well we have those i don't i inevitably if i enter one of those i never catch a thing i just go out there and sit and watch other people do it
and oh yes
yeah oh definitely
certainly here they are
yeah it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and to fish
that's what i do a lot
um-hum
um-hum
i wasn't aware that there was a very large gay community in texas
interesting
yeah and atlanta is sort of the homosexual capital of the southeast so we have quite a few cases here and of course we here a lot about it because the centers for disease control is located here
my feeling on the funding issue is
in proportion to the number of people who are dying of aids
compared to other diseases like cancer and heart disease
we're spending many times more on aids research than we are for these other diseases
and i think a lot of it's just due to political clout and pressure
yeah
that well yes that's true but also we haven't learned enough about cancer to be able to prevent it but it many ways aids is completely preventable through behavioral changes
i do think that part of the reason that we haven't made as much progress in aids research and the reason we're spending so much money on it is that it's almost all of the research is in the hands of the government
and we all know how efficient the government is the way i look at it is if
if all the internal bickering between in center for disease control and the national institutes of health over who's going to get credit for solving it were to be set aside
and if private industry just through the profit motive more than anything else were set loose to go off and find
a cure with the promise that they'd be able to get the financial rewards from it i feel that we'd find a cure really quick
but as it is it's just being the whole program is just being mismanaged by bureaucrats
and it's real disappointing
you know so many of the other major advances that we have today are done by private industry but for some reason in this case no one's really willing to give them a chance
course you know i'm a big advocate of the free market anyway and it seems to me that so much of what the government gets involved in
just goes to pot
but
i
i do want there to be a cure
but like so many other things i think the just the way that we're going about it is not the best way
sure
it's a long time
and it's interesting that there are there do seem to be a lot of people who are hiv positive but who never get the disease
and it seems to me that it's likely that there's some other it's not just the virus that causes it but it's something else in your body that the virus triggers
that causes it and if they can find whatever that other that other
okay
mostly freshwater yeah i used to fish when i was real young down in galveston with my parents and
i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to do anything and i didn't know anybody who had a boat now so i don't fish too much in saltwater
oh really
oh neat
oh really
what'd you do with them
do they have a limit on sharks i mean is that like a sport fish can you actually catch those and there's no limit
uh-huh
right
right
oh really
right
uh-huh
did you
didn't like it
it looks complicated to me it's a rhythm or something
so do you do you fish mainly for trophies or do you do you eat what you fish
uh-huh
right
really
right
right
that's nice
well most of my fishing is done at area lakes around here freshwater lakes and
i went fishing at i don't know if you've ever heard of lake worth it's a fairly new lake in texas
and we went fishing there last memorial day and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep i was so excited and
right
yeah
right
oh yeah
that would be fun
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in rockport which is close to corpus
and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area
and we'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab
so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything
and something i had a rock to weight it down
something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish i'm sure it's not a fish right
and crab they don't bite like that they don't just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life it had real teeth like human teeth
and it looked archaic i had no idea what it was i called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in it's mouth
it not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed they say it's a dogfish from everything i've described it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does
it was the strangest thing it oh i'll never get over that to this day i don't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because i'm sure one of those fish are there
um-hum
i've never heard of that one
um-hum
huh
can you eat them
ooh i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly but
oh that's like this dogfish it was it scared me to death
it was it really it didn't look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died
oh
yes i can understand
oh it's nice and sunny here it's little christmas crispness in the air
and delightful to be outside
and right now i'm watering
yes
and my lawn is very green and my flowers are still blooming
oh you do
um-hum
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
well course that's a constant factor down here what you have to do is keep your keep your ground watered
and the heat really doesn't bother you if you have the right kind of flowers
or and the right kind of lawn for that matter
i have a tiff bermuda lawn here and it -quires a lot of water and you have to keep it cut very short if you want it to look like a golf course green
i don't get to it that often so mine doesn't look like a golf course but it is very nice and shiny and very thin grass
grows real close together
um-hum
turns yellow early huh
and it's not it's not a it's a disease and not a lack of a of chemicals
huh
um-hum
that's when you first notice it but you can put some chemical on that and kill them out and keep them under control you never destroy them
oh very much so we have a lake house down at cedar creek texas seventy five miles north or rather southeast of dallas
well we don't have an automatic sprinkler either see so
or automatic on the sprinkler system
but you know the rye grass and the wild grass that grow makes us a nice lawn
but
oh it's a very large man-made lake in texas it's about a hundred and fifty miles i guess in fort worth
and it supplies fort worth with it's drinking water
and then a hundred and eighty miles further south of there or rather a hundred and eighty miles from fort worth about
forty miles south of cedar creek is another mammoth lake that fort worth owns
that it uses to water
pets do you have pets
oh my goodness
we have a three dogs and two birds at this point parakeets
uh-huh
uh-huh
well we had that happen once my son had the bird back in his room because it's his well the first one that we had was his bird and
i had the ceiling fan put up and it the bird got away from him one afternoon and i mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall i thought oh so much for the bird no he's still alive and kicking
no i guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the right spot but it threw him up against the wall you know and he slid down the wall
oh gosh
oh i hate them
oh my goodness
you're kidding
oh well that's pretty good
oh yeah oh yeah
oh you're kidding
oh
oh my gosh i can not i just i don't do in fact my brother has a
a exotic pet shop out in california and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail you know i'm going don't do that because they won't come in my house
uh-huh
all of those things ugh they need to stay outside far away from me
yeah
oh yeah they are so expensive
well my son was just dying for a bird and i'm really allergic to them so i tried to stay away from them except i've gotten real attached to this one and we went down to canton one time oh gosh
two or three years ago now and he'd saved up his allowance you know and picked him out a bird and a bird cage and that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you
clamped onto my finger and would i mean i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage and he has tried to bite me for two years and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends he'll gives me kisses he talks now
and it's just hysterical i'm the only one that pays attention to him
and i'm a substitute teacher and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my mom's making me get rid of the bird we have too many pets i thought yeah right come tell me about it you know
they knew the sucker when they saw one so now we have two parakeets
well
i'll tell you i watched what went on with the twenty show i don't know if you saw that a few days ago that talked about nursing homes and
actually they specifically talked about some in the area where i am here in texas and
pardon
well i no i'm not familiar with those homes per se but they were in the area where i live
well actually i have that kind of situation because my mother lives with me and she's eighty seven
and from the time that we were tiny she said you know i want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home
so i know how she feels about it you know if i if i ever had to put her there i think it would be probably when i just could not handle it any more you know if i
she got to the point where she was totally bedridden and i mean i just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed i think that would be the
i wouldn't say any more than usual
i think it's very hard for her to be waited upon so to speak i mean i think it's hard for her to
have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to
yeah i think that's very true
on the other hand it takes on almost a switch of a mother child relationship
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
yeah
well that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's as you say lived on a farm for sixty years and then
go to something like that
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
that's right yeah
and
and power corrupts
so
well i do believe there are people that are truly concerned about
society and making a better a better world and go in it
for honest reasons and
maybe wanting to improve
improve the community or country or whatever
but to get elected you have to
it it's absolutely irrelevant the only thing people should be talking about are what are your ideas for
about education about health insurance about foreign affairs or whatever
and none of this other stuff should
and what are and how do you plan to implement programs
and you don't hear any of that
well i really liked the meyer of san francisco i used to live there and voted for him
yes agnus
and for example he had a really good plan for the homeless
which is a huge problem here
and it just got some award
a national sort of recognition as being a program that really looks at the roots of problems
but the problem was that it wasn't quickly implemented or that it wasn't the band aid
so it didn't look good immediately
it really
if you go to solve root problems they take a while
and i think they public
wants quick fixes
and they don't want thoughtful long-term
planning and
so we get disgusted if it's not glitzy
four years
i mean he's the police chief
and was just going to you know round them all up and put them out on a farm or something
oh dear i don't
i don't know and i don't know
oh god we certainly do
i last three years three and a half years
but i think he has been trying to
and
there a lot of places to camp in dallas
uh-huh do you do a lot of camping
uh-huh well that must have been fun though
uh-huh
well that sounds fun
yeah we've done ours i've only been camping twice
and one of them i don't really consider camping it was on the edge of the lake
and it was at a camp i don't like those camping grounds where you know you got r v beside you and then another people in tents beside you
i just don't care for that
right well
it doesn't we four years ago it was about four years ago my little boy was three months old and the first time i left him we went overnight camping and we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake
and we had a ball just sat out there with our we didn't even use tents then we just had sleeping bags and fire going and we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning
oh it did it did i didn't even think about frying potatoes but my sister-in-law she's always done a lot of camping
and she's good she'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out and you know
uh-huh
well yeah she was she is always prepared i mean she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake the only thing we'd had to do
we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill you know
we and we and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped
and we broke the i guess it's the freezing component and we broke that out of there and put it over our hole
yeah
well it held our pan and you know the potatoes and stuff we had a good time
yeah we're still waiting to go again
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
pretty
well i love to swim so i like to get out by a lake or a you know somewhere close where we can swim
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
how old are your boys
oh so they don't go camping with you
oh
think so well it's the water he's not scared of he'll go out into it until it's up to his nose
and then try to tread back
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
if you know what to look for
well that sounds so neat
yes
my mother-in-law and my well they've always done a lot of camping i grew up in louisville kentucky and there wasn't
i don't know but we just didn't get out my mother and my father split up when we were young so and my mother wasn't into that and that's who i stayed with
so we didn't do much outdoors stuff except swimming and we went swimming a lot
and
oh excuse me my baby's getting sick
i know
appreciate it i enjoyed talking thank you bye-bye
well right now i'm just working temporary just for a week or so at a communication center
and so basically i wear i can wear casual dress or casual pants
i don't really dress up a whole bunch but
just
uh-huh
oh they have really strict clothing rules don't they
um-hum
yeah i went to school with some nurses and the cost of those was kind of expensive i thought
they look like they'd last a while
uh-huh
disinfectant
yeah
yeah
yeah they seem to all be all the uniforms even like in the fast food and everything i mean they're the it's just different colors it seems like
they're all kind of alike
i used to work in a dentist office and there i had to dress up and
yeah and i usually wore a dress most of the time or dress pants and
uh-huh
i mean sometimes i think it's cheaper to stay home than because at home i just wear like joggers or levi's or you know whatever comfortable and i don't care what people think
uh-huh and to find ones that are comfortable you really have to pay
yeah
oh wow
like an office manager like
uh-huh
oh yeah
well you always try to look professional but it's just
i don't know i always have a hard time between comfort and
looking nice because when you're working all day sometimes you i don't know comfort seems to come first
i
uh-huh
oh wow
because i've seen a lot of people that always look really hot but i'd i could never make it through a day wearing what they're wearing you know i was like how did you fit in that but and the high heels i don't know i guess i'm just wacky
that's true that is
oh wow
and a longer skirt see that's what i like yeah
i think that looks nice it looks so much more natural
yeah well and quality because i don't know i try to find things that
even if i'm not working that i can wear or else that i know will last you know not just for this year it'll be out of style or something and
those usually cost a little bit but sometimes in the long run i'm sure they're cheaper
yeah
yeah
where i went to school though a at college a lot of them i mean i mean i've never been one to feel
pressured into wearing styles just because everyone else is but i couldn't believe how some of the college people dress because you know i always think of low i at least i was low income going to school you know and it was like
one being maximum control or minimal control
yeah
so i tend to agree on that you know but
made to kill somebody you know
yeah right or cleaning
but
i i've heard some
talk about you know having like a three day waiting period or something if you to try to buy a firearm or something
hand gun
yeah
right
yeah
i mean if you can if you're gonna commit some violent crime and you go and you can get a gun at your leisure then
to restrict it would certainly cut down on that but
you know that people you can get a gun fairly easily i would think i mean i feel like i could get a gun in an hour if i had to you know so obviously it's not gonna
yeah
yeah no time
right
yeah
yeah
right yeah
yeah usually not
yeah i agree at least you have a little bit of time to think about it
and i think i don't know that accounts for at least some of the shootings that go on so in the heat of the moment just go out and buy a gun right then and
the last movie i saw in a theater was hook
and it was very enjoyable
i'm trying to think there's a lot of movies i want to see
but it but what the last one you saw
hum
yeah we do too
is that good that's with i'm trying to think who's in that
oh okay
yeah
we want to go see jfk
i mean i've heard lots of reviews and stuff but i still want to see it just to
and
yeah it is and plano has grown so much that
you know the restaurants and stuff are all so crowded now you use to be able to get out to get a quick bit to eat and go see a movie and it's just not that way any more
so we usually stay in on friday nights and rent movies and i think probably the last rented movie i saw
well no i take that back it wasn't rented i think it was just on hbo at my in-laws house or something but it was hunt for red october
yeah oh that would've been a good one
that would've been a good one to see
yeah but renting them just doesn't do them justice sometimes
yeah that's true i mean i think like dances with wolves just
you know would be a good movie on television but it you know the scenery and everything was so beautiful on the screen
oh really
all of them did you
oh wow in one night
okay i was going to say that's a long movie
how many are there
three okay
yeah
really
um-hum
we went through a stage where we rented a lot of the alfred hitchcock
the you know the like north by northwest and rear window and all those and those are really good i mean you know the old black and whites and
yeah oh yeah
hum
um-hum
yeah
oh they're those are some movies
and they come on every now and then
are you still there
there was no static or anything i thought no
i thought i'd lost you
so you are headed up to tennessee
where about
oh okay that's right yeah i work for ti and i've traveled up to johnson city before and i
most of it was sold off to simon's but there is still about five hundred employees that work that are ti
oh
okay
subject is credit cards and how we use them
okay
i guess so
now what's been your experience with credit cards
yeah
well i belonged to american express many years ago
and they had a reputation or at least they touted that don't go don't leave home without it type attitude that it was good in europe and everywhere
and i went on traveled in europe and i was just absolutely appalled at
the they it was useless
and i think
being overseas for about five weeks there was three occasions i got to use the card
one little hotel out in the middle of nowhere in scotland one little restaurant in denmark and things like that
and later i well i get in a scrap with american express because they made some mistakes in my account and it just took too many letters to get it straightened out
yeah
well i
yeah
well it was something i don't remember the exact details so long ago they tried to sell me some kind of a special card
you know gold card or super card or diamond card and so to do that they had to change my account
and so
some bills came in under the old account after they transferred all the money out
and rather than credit you know move the bills to the new account and pay them off as they should they sent me this statement showing this huge interest charge on
on the account
and it took me a while to get that straightened out
yeah well i tried writing letters to get it straightened out but it took about eight months and i finally said cancel the account and
after about four months they quit sending me letters
and now i only carry one really my wife insisted that i get another credit card and so i do have a visa card
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well i have another credit card our company when you travel because of the tax regulations they don't like to make cash advances
because there's they're concerned with the tax liability there so rather than make a cash advance they issue a credit card and you just charge as you go
and
send your paper work in and by the time the credit card bill comes in presumably you have your check from the company the
-kay you ready
that's it
what kind do you subscribe to or do you
i take a computer magazine
and also
better homes and garden
no
well that's true i like it when they have short stories like redbook used to always have a good short story in it
and i haven't bought a redbook in a while so i guess i really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore
well i think it is surely it's an institution surely it would have to be
but
well i went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that to entertainment
and i was real disappointed with it
i don't know it just
not enough
and that's one thing i don't like about people it's just you know doesn't seem to have enough story to it
no not really
i mean not the one i take now it's a it's a magazine and it goes into all the movies previewing the movies
that are going to be released or it's behind the scenes
and i'm a real movie buff so
that's why i thought i might be interested in it but it just hasn't been what i thought it would be
and my mother has subscribed too the reason i get the
home journal and the
computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me
otherwise if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the
grocery shelf i'll pick it up then
yeah it paid for itself
well i do like recipe and crafts
well that's true
do you
okay
i have two children and they're older now but i found it very difficult to find good child care when i was looking for a place to for stay while i taught school
and
i wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old i preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home and that's what i looked for and i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school and that worked
yeah that worked out real well but when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation three i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and be around kids their own age because i think that's
that would prepare them for school also it's real important that they do that they get that preparation for school
so but i had i have switched schools several times because i really didn't care for what was going on at that the school i wanted them to learn to play i didn't academics forced on them at an early age
yeah for the for the kids yeah
uh-huh
okay
wonderful
oh great
oh that's wonderful
oh great
oh that's wonderful too
uh-huh
oh that's wonderful
oh dear
sure yeah
oh you know that's an ideal situation but not many people can afford something like that
sure
uh-huh
sure
oh i do too
oh yeah but they're are just so many people out there that aren't that lucky
because i'm a single parent and i you know my husband and i ex-husband and i got a divorce when the children were small and so i was a teacher i still am teacher and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was
that was what i wanted where i could have piece of mind and when i taught school and i knew my kids were being taken care of yeah and plus i
i wanted them to get something out of it i just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and
that's it
right
i agree with that
well the thing is i teach fifth grade and i can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other children and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically because
they were not they're should be there's to many things in their way and so i want my i wanted my children and they did learn to get to get along with other people
yeah and i mean i feel a lot of maladjusted adults and i bet if we trace back to their early childhood we could see some
you know times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with people
uh-huh
i bet you could too because it you know kids have to learn how to get along with other people and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really you know good adults or
successful adults i should say you know really
but it is a big problem and you know i have lot of friends right now that have young children and they
daily have problems with whoever is taking care of the child or they switch a lot which is not good for the child either
so you need because you need that consistency when they're young like that and it would be ideal like you hope when you have children your wife gets to stay home i would have given anything if i would have been able to stay home with my children yeah you are
right
oh great
um-hum
oh that's wonderful
oh that's good
you're very wise
sure
uh-huh
oh don't they though that's what i have right now thirteen and a sixteen year old oh it is they really are expensive yeah
exactly well and they most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars so
you know right now i'm looking for a little truck for my for my son so that you know an older truck so i can afford it but you know
i just look forward to him helping me out because i for years just car driven carpools all over the place and
and it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store will you take
his sister somewhere or something like that
right exactly
right
that's right
it does forever
oh they come in see this is the first time i've done this
oh in ten minutes you have to talk that long
uh-huh
oh
i see
i see are you from the where are you from
oh my gosh i'm from plano texas which is which is outside of dallas
yeah because that's where ti is that makes sense
that sounds
but i gather you do not separate the bottles and cans
uh-huh
yes
yes i know not only have i come to washington but i find it very amusing that the
thing that was just instituted here is very similar that is we also have blue bins we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck
and land fill space is indeed the driving factor here and in fact despite all of our open space out here land fill space is still very hard to come by
ah but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
yes other than nuking it in fact los alamos has done a fair amount of research in recycling things in general
it involves for instance creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and other things from
waste material in general and purify the waste of specific nasty elements
and the other thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody has
they've looked at plutonium and uranium and some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
and again this is driven by all of the documentation and e s and h considerations that people are worrying about i think much more than they should
actually i've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable back when i was in graduate school i did all of the recycling of the paper from the computer center
and in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable recycled paper
i think that's a wonderful idea
if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would speak more directly to the space need than the land fill
and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
well i'm kind of leaning towards
i don't know i'm thinking about what from one to ten what my number would be it'd probably be somewhere closer to less control because i don't see i'm not a member of the nra although my father is but
i guess i believe i think the nra has gone overboard the wrong way you know they're sitting there on number ten they're saying absolutely no gun control we don't even want to think about it and
and i think that's a dumb situation because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose you know if you're going to hunt with it if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week
it's not a big deal for them to go if they can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket you know i mean they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record armed you know felony record you know
any of that kind of stuff and it seems to me right now that there's not
there's not that much of a check i i'm not really sure what texas law i think there's a check for
for felonies on your record if the gun shop owner does it you know but
yeah if and if it's a private sale of course then there's nothing
um-hum
yes but maybe well prevent a few john hinkleys
you know i that's the kind of people i like i say i don't think the guy who's going to rob a 7-eleven is going to rob a 7-eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or you know whatever
but
you know
yeah and the people who want it it's not that big a deal like i said to wait
yeah it makes you wonder what they need it for all of a sudden here hum
yeah i imagine his opinion is a little bit towards the one there on the scale of one to ten he needs some more gosh if i was a cop i'd be
too many people have too many too much access
and i guess i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of i mean
some of these saturday night specials that these companies put out that are a piece of i mean they're basically it says here buy me and go rob a 7-eleven that's
yes they that's really gotten bad
or your child accidently if your child is old enough i mean there're a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve or fourteen or
and especially some of the minority children whether you know a racist or not that's the truth and if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up
because there's been kids that age who have killed people and you know you know there was a law in
i think it's in oregon where they've now made all toy they're making them like neon colors you know yeah and the kids don't care my kid doesn't care he picks up a stick and goes bang so it doesn't make any difference to him
yeah
yeah so you ought to do i think they ought to do that with toy guns they ought to make them very reasonably do something outrageous to them you know so that they're not so that they're very distinguishable from a real gun
yes
that's kind of they encourage it
hum
hum
i don't know i
that's kind of an odd thing i don't know i have a gun and i mean my folks have always had i learned to shoot when i was real little i think that's a lot of it too is that people
need to teach their kids what not to what to do and what not to do because i started shooting my dad
started letting me shoot like a little air bb gun when i was probably five or six years old but
you know it was this is how you hold it this is the only place that you do it which was you know out far and away and you don't ever touch it unless i'm here and you don't point it at people and then they had then i went to the texas
parks and recreation i guess but anyway the hunter safety program that you have to do now i think it started in about nineteen seventy if you want if you want to go deer hunting and your birthday's after
nineteen something fifty five or something then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses or you can't get a deer license
and it and it's basic stuff it's like it's don't you know when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence don't point you don't lean your gun against it you know and you and then you crawl over it and have it shoot yourself and it
those things happen it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people
oh yeah
does he got them locked up all the time too when he's home
don't even think about it yeah
yeah
hum
um-hum yeah if you make it where it's not something
yeah not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared of if it if it's just one more piece of something but they've got to understand like you said never touch it but yeah
ours is a we have a shotgun and it's up in the closet
and then the shells are in another part and sometimes i think about it and i got it because my husband used to travel and be out of he was out of country one time for three months
and i was like you know we're in a nice neighborhood but still and you and then i've got it so far sometimes i think i wonder if i
hum
i know i used to think about it was a lot easier when i was when i was when i was single it was one thing and when i was just married with no kids when it was just me
it was an easy decision
and then you know what how can you even afford to think about what you're going to do with it because you don't know where your kids are at the same time ugh
yeah we do too yeah i figure they'll make enough noise but
yeah it's i kind of think we have two big dogs in the backyard i always kind of thought that too kind of an extra buffer
yeah anything that the well any advantage they can take
yeah i think that's about all i can
we're in pretty good agreement actually on it would be an interesting it would be even more interesting you to meet some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum that's opposite
me too it's nice to find there's another reasonable person in garland well it's been nice talking to you bye-bye
well my family has a has a sailboat and we haven't actually been out in it in a while but we do
there's a lake right at by our airport here in dallas and lake grapevine
and actually i have not done much sailing i had
i would i have crewed in it
all kinds of plans to go out and take lessons and do it and
for a while there we had flooded lakes and didn't have a chance to so i haven't done that yet
i'm trying to remember probably
i really can't remember
it's a boat that my sister and i had told
my father who's in his seventies we had said you know maybe
it would be maybe sometime we'd like to learn more about sailing and he who he is the one who loves sailing and he's the one who's been in it
and he just went out and bought a boat we didn't mean it that seriously so he went out and bought one he is not fun to sail with it is always a crisis and so
he turned me off against it when i was young and then later different men that i have known have had boats and they made it fun
but he doesn't
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i bet that's fun
uh-huh
oh
oh how fun
yeah
yeah
i bet
it is you can have a motor on it and a lot of them do i just because if you get out there and there's no wind it's pretty hard to get back
i find it very relaxing i think they're absolutely beautiful i you know i really as i say would like to learn to do it myself just got turned off early on by
a particular manner but it's a wonderful feeling my son and can sail and he and i have gone out
i find that
yeah the closer to the wind you are
then you've seen sailboats out where they're just way over
and that's his favorite way even to the point where you've got to have someone on the up side you know putting some weight on there so you don't go over
well you know i mean since he's doing the other there you know where am i supposed to go so that is not my favorite but a friend who i dated years back and i would go out and that was just wonderful you'd
you know take some take a picnic and go out and you can go in little coves and
it's so quiet it's it that that's something i love i mean i like ski boats too
and the speed and you know going around but there's something extremely peaceful about a sail boat
yeah
yeah
yeah drop an anchor and you know there've been the times when the anchor catches in something and you get
spend a lot of time yeah trying to get it back up et cetera but
really comfortably about four adults
and
well not this one but some are there's so
okay so my children are twenty and twenty four and
my son just moved
to arkansas so he's married so course when they're here when they lived here and i have a daughter whose twenty and we spend a lot of time together
i was a single parent and i spent most of my life with my children i did a did a lot things with the kids
but yeah it's a i don't i
i one thing that happened is when my son graduated from high school and he went off to college
then it drastically changed prior to that we had sit down dinners and we talked and we did a whole lot of things and then when he left
you know i think that might i don't know i don't know you know it's been so long since i had little children at home i'll leave it up to you as to what's really going on these days
yeah
uh-huh
right
oh so you're not working now great
hum
yeah
right but you know if i know now that i can look back and i think about how much
how much time i devoted to my children and
not necessarily but sacrificed a social life because i really did devote myself to my children basically i mean
i mean i was i mean i did some things but i mean i really did but i have no regrets about that and i you know
and i can look back and it was so much fun being a kid with them and getting to do all the fun things that
you know you get to do it that kids get to do and that you wouldn't do by do you know with other adults
so it's great fun i really envy you
this is a wonderful time of your life
um-hum
well i can remember my mom started working
the youngest and she started working when i went to first grade and i can remember
just a couple of few times that she would stay home and i don't know if she was sick or just wanted to take the day off or what but
come home from school and you know like you'd tell that she'd just mopped and she had you know food was cooking and the house smelled so good
i tell you what i'd i don't know if children who maybe children who have that everyday don't appreciate it as much as you know
but it really was really was a special and i wished that she could have been home more it would have been greater because she was
because she worked she was always kind of high strung and you know
didn't have the time to spend with us individually so
i think it's great if you enjoy staying home with your kids while they're young and can do it
that's right
well and so you probably have a lot of friends who have small children do you do you find the trend is
away from what you're doing or that they're not spending that much time with them put them off with
sitters and how about
right
right
yeah
well that's great
well
well i meant you know i meant
if you don't ever have to go to work and you and you're happy you know even if your
kids all the way through high school and then it doesn't mean you have to go back to work
so
okay the hours are at least to be home you know
that way maybe then you can find out if you're really happy doing that if you want to do it full time later on
well maybe now that you've had your own children you'll like to be around little children or have a little better tolerance
that'd be tough yeah
nice talking to you and maybe i'll talk to you again okay bye-bye
all right that's a real different topic i'm not sure i'm familiar with
with what they mean of invasion of privacy
yeah
yeah
and says mrs miller have we got a deal for you
it's like how do you know my name where did you get my phone number and why do you think it's a deal for me
i mean those people they'll call you any time of the day or night with try to solicit and that's an invasion of my privacy i think
oh they do already
well and i've even had the computer generated calls on sundays too
um-hum
but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls
but don't answer your phone hello the computer's geared to start talking to you on the on the word hello
uh-huh
oh yeah oh yeah
are you and your roommate a similar size
and she still goes through your clothes
uh-huh
ooh
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah i agree
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah
uh-huh
my mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets
i mean we're all grown all her kids are grown and we have our own families and now if we go through her cabinets she's like well what are you digging for
yeah like what are you doing don't you have your own house to dig through
yeah so
i guess that privacy is really
and at the work place i suppose oh well actually yes i can say definitely that privacy at the work place i hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
because that was that was where i kept all my stuff and i could tell i mean even if a pen was turned the wrong way oh yeah
it would drive it drove me batty for a while yeah well i worked a second shift
and everybody else in my area worked first shift and our shifts overlapped
so i would come in and there would be people sitting at my desk working
and i'm wondering you know
what is this it's my vitamins
i wonder what is you know yeah what is why are they working at my desk and can i have it back
can i have it back soon maybe
oh yeah no mommy is going to take the vitamins
i'm sorry i have a small person
yeah
oh yeah well you know how you left it the day before
oh yeah
so that's
yeah i agree it's pretty tough that way
and
i know even like with your school books and paper
do you miss your papers sometimes
yeah well actually i do know and i have used it once and it really is an invasion of privacy but
in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live by their street address yeah
and that i mean i've used it once
hello okay
do you work at ti
yeah
what company are you are you working at all
oh okay
yeah
uh-huh
what
oh yeah don't ever think of those as a benefit but they sure are
yeah what is their sick leave policy
is it paid
do you get penalized for taking it off
the reason why i said is ti the hourly employees
they have i'm not sure up to five years they have a certain number of days and after five years they have unlimited personal time off but
if they miss more than say ten point five hours in a three month period they get penalized for it so really they don't ever huh
huh-uh
and they lose their certification pay which is like fifty five cents an hour for three whole months so it's really not a very good benefit
yeah
yeah that's the biggest thing and people come to work sick but when their kids get sick it's like well i can't afford to take off but i have to
uh-huh
that's true it is it's not really consistent
yeah i really wish that somebody in big companies or any company would take a hint from like that movie nine to five did you see that where they had the child care right there on the
that was so good and that would help the morale of parents i think so much
because i hate to see that i mean probably ninety percent of the people that work for me are single parents and they have to you know use child care at least for a couple hours a day
so i don't know i really think a big company needs to take responsibility for that
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's good
i know it's real i don't have kids yet but it's tough
what kind of
how many vacation days do you get a year
that's great for how many years you been have you worked there
oh wow that's great
um-hum
huh
yeah
ti isn't doing very well so like i'm negative vacation because i've only worked there three years and i get five days every six months well
every about two three months we shut down for a week because you know there's no demand for our product so
yeah and so we've shut down six weeks a year whereas we used to only shut down two
and so it's kind of hurt
yeah
and luckily my boss has maybe you know allowed me to work it off but a lot of people you know go in the hole and take you know weeks without pay and it's tough
i don't ever but the people that work for me do yeah
i mainly the reason because i'm salary so i don't ever lose pay i mean i just go in debt for vacation so yeah
yeah mainly because i haven't had really had to use it much i mean
yeah i have to pay for my husband which is kind of expensive for him i mean it's like
sort of yeah the reason why i don't know much is because i don't real i haven't really had to use like my medical i know they increased the deductible last year which kind of hurt
and i don't know and after that they pay like eighty percent and the dentals the dental covers quite a bit but like i said i've never really been sick or anything so i've never had to use it
is that like match savings
yeah it's fifty percent matched
some companies i know are a hundred percent matched yeah like harris semiconductors in florida
really
ours is only up to four percent though
yeah
because i mean i only put in like a real small amount because it's four percent you know after that you put it in and you get like interest i mean i've saved quite a bit it's helped me a lot but
you have to roll it over to an ira if you ever quit
but you know that's still a good deal
yeah it teaches people to think of the future i think
really
ooh
wow
that's kind of a rip
huh
ti didn't even give raises this year so
no they gave a few bonuses but for the most part no nobody in ti got raises
yeah
yeah
really
so how do you feel about capital punishment
really
oh i'm pretty much for it
wrongfully yeah
yeah it would never be equal
right
right yeah
well i guess
you know i guess i can see it from several different perspectives but
you know when i hear about things like you know what they've what they've been reporting about in milwaukee
you know i to me i don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy you know maybe there is i don't know
but you know and
you know he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society he's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation
i mean i don't know i just i really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko
and you know for the things he's done i don't know i guess it's either you know put him in jail for the rest of his life
you know or capital punishment i guess you know and
uh-huh
oh really uh-huh
right
yeah well i can i mean you know there is always that chance but you know
i guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever i don't i mean i don't know but you know
that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be
you know you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that you know for any for any situation really
but
you know when i when you find somebody just like that situation i mean it was disgusting when i read about it today and when you find someone like that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven
i i'd you know i guess i have a hard time feeling merciful toward him and you know
right
right
right and trying to rehabilitate him too and you know
right exactly you know and nobody wants that you know everybody would be just be scared to death
you know we've had a real problem here in texas with prison overcrowding and they've been releasing people left and right and you know they've committed murders and rapes and everything else and
you know you just think you know where's the justice here i mean you know they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving
oh really
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right exactly yeah well you know that's exactly i mean
i'm not saying i think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case you know especially because there are some cases when you just don't know and i think there's a shadow of a doubt
you know like with this guy in milwaukee i mean it he pretty much confessed to it i mean they you know just everything i mean cannibalism and everything else
i really would have a hard time especially if i was on a jury not wanting him to you know be executed yeah
because i mean that's just awful
right and well i have a i have a hunch that you know the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway either i mean you know they i don't know from what i hear about jail life is not any way to live but
i don't know it's just
and i
um-hum
really
yeah
yeah
yeah
that
yeah well you know especially like repeat offenders it just appalls me that they can be out
you know they even get a ten year sentence and be out in two or three or four years
you know that's scary because you know i'm not sure
i think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're you know going to be committing any more violent acts or not
right
and it it's really scary i you know i don't know what the perfect solution to that is but i know that especially with violent crimes where you know you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else you know then
i don't know i guess
i just really don't see much use for this guy in milwaukee you know for instance i mean that's just i could see capital punishment in a case like that
and you know for other people too that do things like that
but when my wife and i are both participating in this survey and she picked up the phone and when she heard the topic she said capital punishment so she was
so she tried to enter her number and it wouldn't work so she said whew it's for you so
but you know i don't know i struggle with it but i really think that in
in terms like this i
i think that it that it might not be such a bad thing
because i don't know that anybody in i don't know that anybody would feel good you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community you know i i'm you'd have to be scared to death
now that's what i really
never stops ringing right
yeah
hum even in an office
uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
um-hum i know
oh yeah well you know these people they sell your names i mean you know i that's also an invasion of privacy i think if the whole thing is a
oh they do
well sure it is
um-hum
that's right
yeah that's right
but
oh i'm from texas
oh we're in plano
and that was california i was thrilled to death because that's the you know the furthest i'd gotten any call from you know and
oh really
oh
yeah see well that's there was another call on saturday that was also from that was the one from california
originally from new jersey
yeah
oh really what part
oh that's nice over there yeah we're from more from a sort of towards the shore central new jersey you know we're like
uh-huh
yeah so their
well yeah i mean yeah and of course they call you know before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous you know i said this is absurd i the you know i the minute i get home the phone would be ringing
oh it's great i mean
well you know in fact i've been missing calls from the ti switchboard because i always have it on you know and i'll get that message that says to
you know but i just got totally disgusted and you know people asking for money for everything you know i mean
exactly and you know the policeman's association
okay
do you have yeah there's a recycle center in plano isn't there
oh really that'd be neat
yeah
that i would love i wish carrollton would do that
well i'm i fortunately live pretty close to the wal-mart and there's a pretty good size recycle center behind the wal-mart so it's convenient for me to do it but curbside would be much more convenient
yes i know
oh really
yeah
yeah my husband is a landscaper and so they all bought the or the mulching mowers so that they don't they don't bag anything anymore
yeah it vacuums it up and back up into the air several times and chops it up so fine that
you know it really is what from what i understand helpful to the grass and then plus you don't have the big bags of grass every time
yeah so
yeah we have at this center we have plastic glass aluminum and newspapers
but the i noticed going to work the other day there's a warehouse or paper company and they buy like your office paper that you've used
yeah and so i've started that in my office but it's kind of it's not as convenient because they want you to have a certain amount before you'll take it to them
but i was reading in a magazine the other day and i hadn't even thought about doing this that a lady mainly for cost cutting reasons
has sent out a memo to everybody in her company that says if you're sending out interoffice memos it's got to be on the backside of a paper that's already been used
well i know i mean i showed them the brochure that the city sent out that you know explained how many if you
recycle this many cans this much power's saved and all this stuff so i think they're beginning to get a little more aware of it but
yeah
oh
yeah
it really is
i've gotten my husband kind of trained now because it's real funny because i would pull a jar out and rinse it out to put in the glass and he'd throw it away
but you know i don't i don't have any kids yet and that's what they kept stressing in a lot of the brochures is if your kids are going to you know be able to survive at all without having mounds of trash around them everybody's got to start doing this
oh that's good
well that's neat
huh
yeah well i'm anxious to get it little more implemented into my office i've got the aluminum cans out and i've got the
newspapers where everybody's pretty much aware of that because they get yelled at if they throw their
but now what i'm going to do with this recycled office paper is just get separate trash cans and
so
yeah
so i don't know we'll see but that lady said she was real surprised that she did get a lot of protest at first but she said it's cut down on their office expenses a lot and
it's just recycling so anyway we'll see
yeah but i mean i guess there's only so much they can do as far as advanced stuff now but something else that i'd really like to get into more and i haven't is
the like the downy softener products and stuff that you just buy the concentrate
i wish they'd get more into that
yeah and even just the companies coming out with more things like that
so i don't know i know a lot of companies are real dedicated to it i just got a brochure from my insurance company the other day and
but i mean they made a big deal to let everybody know that whole brochure was recycled and can be recycled again
yeah it really was
oh yeah
yeah
oh my gosh
yeah
wow
yeah
oh
well
one of my girlfriends recently had a baby and she goes about half and half
she uses the cloth diapers at home but she said when you're traveling it's just almost impossible
so she says she feels like she's doing her part some because she's not using them all the time
well mostly a little fresh water fish but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because i used to live in utah
but down here i haven't fished much in texas
yeah and they really like that
now i have never caught catfish
uh-huh
because they fight the best
oh is that right
now in amarillo did you fish anytime
uh-huh
uh-huh right
oh how about that
oh
oh i think that is really interesting
um-hum
i think the
see and i wish i could go fishing here because i don't really know much about the fishing here i guess it would if you did it like you were just saying
that's pretty much like rainbow trout you bait the hook you throw it in
you troll it a little bit and then you wait and then you troll it a little bit
no i don't
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
you are now i've never used those that's really interesting
yeah
what kind of fish do you like the best to eat
oh do you
yes i've done fishing like that but tell me what
oh i know they're sort of like well i want to say flies but not exactly like the
yeah
the yellow ones
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah my mom she just loves to fish and she has a lot of those little
they almost look neon you know they're just real colored colorful things on her onto her ends yeah and she she's really a good fisherwoman
yeah
well you sound like you're a good fisherwoman too
forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that
the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting fuels are being experimented with ethanol and
other types of fuels
i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i
i don't know for sure i just know that acid rain apparently is a big problem in canada from what comes over the border from us
yeah
yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes i guess there's been a lot of pressure to
do away with the cfcs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem
discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially
well it is scary and i think it will
continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively
we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment
and it's really bad in places like los angeles and it's gotten bad in denver and it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky
and people in this country are really wedded to their cars and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems
yeah
yeah
well that makes a lot of sense i mean i hadn't thought about it that way but it
yeah
set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a
big structural change in the economy
in this country whether people are willing to get out of their cars and in this country the solution that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars
and i'm i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but
i think we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and i'm not sure
how long it's gonna take or what it's gonna take because they keep saying that the economy
is gonna depend on how many cars and houses we sell
what are your music interests
yeah i did too and then
oh really
was yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah i he is really good yeah i've
a big appreciation for music
do you
yeah that's nice to do that is
yeah
so let's see what
well what kind of music do you not like
yeah
have you ever been to the to the dallas symphony have you is it are they good
are they i have never i've never been
oh really
i've heard i've heard that is a really
probably cost
yeah the
was it i how i can't i don't know what that's about
oh i think i know who you're oh i know who you're talking about she's got black hair
and well my parents
yeah my husband likes country music real well and he likes some of the new groups like shenandoah and yeah he really likes shenandoah
oh i've never cared for hank williams junior
yeah
wow
i've heard the name
huh
i've never seen a gene autry movie hm
yeah
yeah those go back quite a ways
yeah
it's hard to
oh yeah
yeah
well that would that's neat
that would be great if they weren't too worn out at the time
well that's true
oh yeah
well that's a shame
a lot at the store at or in record stores you'd
no
um-hum well those things were big and thick weren't they
they just they're not meant to last at all
oh no
radio yeah
was it kept it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does
oh yeah
what day what day was that on do you can you recall
i do but they're but they're both out of college so i have one who's living in an apartment in another city
and i have one who's actually living with me because of the economy and the job that she's got but she's about
she's on the verge of moving to her own apartment so what about you
uh-huh
oh little ones then
yeah
wow oh you mean like state parks that kind of
uh-huh
uh-huh
you probably have pretty ones there when you were saying parks i was just we have a different terrain here so
um-hum
yes so the mountains would take a while to get around to find any there are some as a matter of fact but what other things do the kids like to do
like weekends or during the winter do they ski or
it is expensive yeah
yeah
um-hum
hm
yeah that's fun
yes that's
um-hum
um-hum
well the twelve year old probably feels he or she's much older than the four year old so there should be different activities in their minds in at any rate yeah
well that's good
and we still we
like disney movies we really got into them when they were young there were a number of movies that we liked and we just simply liked the experience of the movies and
ironically my twenty my twenty four and my twenty two year old last year for christmas we rented jungle book you know
and i gave one of them jungle book and one of them fantasia for christmas this year and it was one of their favorite gifts so
we would all just stop and watch whatever the mountain lions were doing or whatever was going on
yeah which was which was fun yeah and so
yeah we did and we enjoyed that my now we my kids back when they were younger got did we would go from here to like colorado and ski
and they did both learn to be scuba divers
we went once on a vacation with my parents
to an island and they snorkeled and that really got them you know fascinated with the deep and so they actually went through all the course and all the trouble in the middle of missouri as we were living in kansas city then
and went and i don't can't remember what it's called but it's
five heartbeats
who was in that
okay
when was it out
um-hum
yeah
that's
yeah i saw that one that was pretty good that won
best picture i think
and
costner got best director
one comes to mind here and i i'm not sure about the name has meryl streep and
what was the name of that
anyway the premise of the story is that
you go to a after you die you go to a place called judgment city
and anyway i can't the other the other actor
yeah and
defending your life defending your life and it's an excellent movie it's pretty entertaining
let's see what else have i seen lately
home alone
okay yeah
yeah well did you ever see home alone
that was a that was a that was a good one too
yeah it's pretty good and
i don't know i can't believe i'm just drawing a blank because i've
um-hum
that kinds of reminds me like did you ever see this is going way back jagged edge
that was a good one too yeah
but
yeah that's
oh okay
um-hum
yeah
what i've seen
and
and a pop you know so it's it gets pretty
yeah like if i so if i take a date it cost me you know twenty bucks easy
and
i don't know
i was going to say
you know you can find certain restaurants that are nice and have good food for
eat for thirty dollars
yeah the problem is you always have to wait until they're out
so that's what you're
you're dealing with
that's true that is true
i ought to open the paper here because i know i've seen a few that have that played but
i just can't come up with any names here haven't been to one for a little while
but
did you ever see kindergarten cop
that was pretty good
yeah um-hum
but
okay
yeah whose in that
um-hum another one i saw is called the object of beauty
i don't recommend that as much as defending your life but it was it was all right kind of funny
but
what else has
been on and about
yep
i'm trying to i wanted to get to the silence of the lambs i hear that
oh did you see that
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hm
hm
yeah i'll probably try to go
to see it in a little while here but it's been out for a while
you heard anything on like out for justice
has he had has he had very many other movies out
because it's a macho movie
speaking of that i think terminator 2 is supposed to be out
i don't know i've enjoyed a lot of his movies they just they're action filled and they're a little bit of humor and
the
yeah
you ever see
sleeping with the enemy
i haven't
i haven't heard much lately i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews
yeah
you expect more out of julia roberts though
did you ever see the original fx movie
oh okay because i was going to say i always enjoyed that i remember that movie and it was i mean i got into it
and they have f fx 2 out
i don't know if
yeah it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it yeah it it's
i can't put it exactly on the lines of the jagged edge but it you know kind of on that end you know you get these twists and
it's usually pretty good but
what's that
yeah
yeah
that's probably true i just
you see the same story lines different characters and
i don't know it's hard to say and i know i don't
you know i'm i don't keep up with it
you know but
i don't try to just for that reason it is a it does cost a lot so why
go out and see something right away you know you kind of wait and if something gets really good reviews maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks you know to go to it
but
you know i haven't been to a an opening for oh you know ages
just because
oh most of the cars i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or
or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that
oh yeah basically that's it
yeah i've got an eighty four chevy van that's a one ton van with a camper conversion on it
it's got the good old three fifty standard engine in it regular gas engine and that engine i understand i can i can actually work on that engine
yeah
uh-hum
right
yeah
i had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago and it was really fairly easy take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it
a few years ago i had an oldsmobile diesel and the it after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it and i bought it when we were living in lubbock when i came back here i brought the car back here and
i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the thing i mean though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff and the injector pump went bad so i
found an outfit down here to rebuild it and reinstalled that and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time
yeah
well the injector nozzle and stuff in you know the big diesel farm tractors you know what are about the size of your
thumb and the yeah you can get to them and the ones in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with
what the availability
you mean the diesel availability
yeah well i'd bought a gmc diesel pickup
and loved that thing you know i really liked it but it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really
needed and it was the van that i needed then to buying the you know traded it in on the chevy van but i sure enjoyed it
yeah the three fifty regular gas engine
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
think that little the little chevy v eight when it started out in sixty in fifty five i think was two sixty five something like that little
they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred small block four hundred that was the same block you know just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more yeah
well that was that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up
the two little cars i've got now
bought a mitsubishi mirage here a couple years ago and it was normally carbureted and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
the friend of ours over here he's got sixty five or sixty six mustang with the six cylinder
and i was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road it's amazing
you could yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah well when they went to the started with the newer engines you know when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble because the three fifty with all the
you know like well actually i guess here within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i've paid any attention to it the three o five was that v eight that they put in the three quarter and half ton van and it had all the air pump and
i don't know all that all that stuff and all the antismog stuff and boy that was really a mess back under there under the in that van
uh-huh
oh it's that one that's about what an inch and a half wide got a bunch of groves in it
yeah
yeah and we'll how many times have you done this now is this
yeah i hadn't not gotten any calls here in the last this is the first one in a week or so and
if it's
winding down or what
finding a taker
yeah well
okay all righty bye-bye
uh-huh i have got two one is two and the other one's four and this is my first year of staying home i've always had them in child care
uh-huh
uh-huh
well it was our second sitter the first one didn't quite work out there were some things going on that i wasn't really happy with and so i felt that
that i need to move on with them and so i found another babysitter and she was wonderful except i thought that there were too many in the home
and it just seemed like it was so hard to find really good child care she was wonderful it's just that i just felt there were too many in the home it was in home child care
uh-huh all right
uh-huh right
and
and then i worked in a child care centers and i wasn't really happy with the particular one that i was working in
so i just always had a fear about you know child care centers so that's why i put him in a in a in home day care
independent and i could go back to work
hm
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
oh no yeah
um-hum
um-hum
wow
um-hum
um-hum
hm
um-hum
oh
uh-huh and how old is he
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
oh
yes my little boy goes to the methodist in garland um-hum i'm real happy with that one
well i've heard that the methodist ones are excellent uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah because this is first united methodist in garland that he goes to and i'm real happy with that
uh-huh
yeah well that a
and i taught early childhood and i really enjoyed it but it was just it was taking a lot of my time and i noticed i was spending less and less time with them and it just seemed like they were sick more often and i just couldn't get the time off to
so
yeah it is it really is yeah it really is and i felt
right
indeed yeah
yeah right well i've got three kids the oldest is nine and the youngest is three and we have actually a live in child care worker here
that we you know a nanny that lives here and that makes it very easy for us
and prior to that we had you know to take child care we took the kids to somebody else's home and that worked out okay but it wasn't that great
well we you know it was just
a young adult in the family just about
well
a little bit of a problem but you know that's just reality of it and you know you have to work with them and tell them ahead of time that somebody's leaving and somebody else is gonna be coming in
and help them adjust to the situation
oh the youngest is three and the oldest is nine and the middle one is six and the after -chool school situation is great it's really convenient to have
somebody whose job it is to make sure they're that they get home and you know are taken care of properly
you know all old enough to go to school have to use some after school service our local ymca has something like that
but it
well yeah to a certain extent
i guess you know my wife does more of that sort of i mean she
she and the and the caretaker have intense discussions about that and i suppose i'm
sort of a slug for not getting more involved but that's the way it is
oh it works out pretty well i think it's a good plan i think it's kind of disgraceful that it's so hard for so many people
well yeah
but it's absolutely you know situation like ours you know where we could make enough money to cover it properly
you know both we both work and then we pay the pay the nanny and we pay the workers compensation insurance and we pay the withholding taxes we
basically well i'm a vegetarian and my husband is kosher so if do you know what that means kosher okay so a lot of the restaurants we select are
based on the variety of food i don't particularly like to sort of american you know meat and potatoes type of restaurants
i love ethnic foods i love chinese indian tai
well as long as you're not eating meat it's to be kosher the meat would have to be kosher
yeah exactly vegetables and the same with you know a lot of people wonder do you know do you find restaurants that will just have vegetarian meals and even
if like you know you could go to a chinese restaurant and eat the right italian you know that
right
yeah and even one of my favorites is el torito's i don't know if you have that it's mexican it's like a chi-chi's
really why
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
we certainly would if
oh does she now do you guys like to go out for sort of fine dining or are you more
um-hum
uh-huh um-hum
right
oh
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
crepes yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i was i was wondering if you guys eat a lot of fish yeah
uh-huh
no
sure yeah i have heard of that
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
i see it's sort of like some people and ketchup yeah
uh-huh
oh really
oh wow well you know i have a problem because i tend to find a restaurant and being on a on a tighter budget you know we don't go out to eat that much so once i find a restaurant i only want to go there
and i'll go there for you know two months straight we won't go anyplace else
and then you know i finally get sick of that one and then i'll find another restaurant i love salad bar restaurants because
i find that when you order a salad at a restaurant you don't really get a salad you get like lettuce and you know what i mean and the croutons
exactly but a salad bar that's my favorite i mean if because i just feel like i can make my own meal and there's usually a lot of fun stuff and obviously it's a lot of vegetables but
um-hum yeah i know what that's like uh-huh
um-hum
oh that's good
uh-huh um-hum
oh really
now is she does she like mcdonald's french fries oh okay
oh
um-hum
um-hum
yep
well that's great
it just more yeah i know what you mean
yeah
oh do you
but still uh-huh
well you know it's funny that you say that because our grocery store i personally i think the grocery stores in rochester are very they'll allow you to bring your own like tupperware thing like your own container
to fill it up i think that's great and you weigh your container you know and then you weigh your salad after that
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
oh jeez
oh man
yep
uh-huh
a lot more waste yeah
um-hum that true
uh-huh well i don't usually resort to fast food if i do i feel like it's a salad or something at mcdonald's but i do rely on pizza a lot
i mean to me either ordering in or just going to pizza hut or something
okay well they just they'll do everything with pizzas as a matter of fact last night we just went there and they have a great pizza called spinoccoli and what it is normal pizza but then with spinach and broccoli
and it's really good and i feel like
yeah tell her about that and i feel like i'm getting a little bit more health out of that pizza then maybe just well i wouldn't eat pepperoni but you know sausage or something like that but
so i
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
oh yeah
really
um-hum
cashews or something like that right
um-hum
well spinoccoli she can't patent the idea though because pizza inn already has it but it's a it's very good well they put it they i guess they put like the dough and then the sauce and then
um-hum
um-hum
well we've got a lot too i'm in texas in garland right outside of dallas
asians vietnamese we we're getting a lot of mexican americans you know we've had those for a long time
and i don't know what the solution is
to get them on their
yeah
right
hum
uh-huh
and there's a lot of graft like people trying to tell them oh giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it
yeah
right
you mean really trying to plant something that's what you're saying farming
ah
oh that's terrible
uh-huh
and not being cared for yeah that's true well what did you do when you helped these people how did what did you do through
about how really to go about helping people to learn another language i mean it's like people don't know what to say it's not step to step
and their teachers and
their parents so much more than my children do you know and
i like it and what i've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this asian center that a doctor falk has started that works with the school district and doing what
trying to get them set and inculturated
into the system i thought that would be good experience for me and i've applied at another district where many of the children are asian
and i think that would be wonderful too
right
well and times were different too
my neighbor let's see is jewish and he's going through the i don't know jewish league or something and helping a family that's come over from russia
and he spends well right now he's down to like once a week but he was going over there several times a week to meet with the family and help them with the language and he thoroughly enjoyed it
no
um-hum
having to do with computers but their training isn't what we need in this country and because they're so deficient in english they haven't been able to get jobs
so they'll have to go back and get a degree here you know almost start all over
no and this woman was stocking the shelves in a drugstore
is it saturday
uh-huh i can't i can't remember
yeah the episode that i watched
and he seems to do that sometimes
yeah i thought it was a pretty good show
i also like i like to watch like sixty minutes and twenty
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
i imagine that keeps you busy
yeah
oh wow
that must be tough
it doesn't matter just a healthy baby
yeah
yeah it's not quite the same
well you know it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be
you know i remember like the flintstones and the jetsons and those were just kind of good old cartoons
yep
yeah and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
so tell me about your home
all right
yes
we're talking from dents into holes
i understand we've got i've got a daughter
oh
kids are hard on houses
yeah
we live in a mobile home and that's probably not typical america but
and
seems like we're always working on it
as i'm sure it is with your house
yeah
ten girl
so you know just like yours
ours is always
you know we're something else goes wrong always you know it's
no appliances we had a couple plumbing problems we've
yes
yeah there are there's big military constituency
oh no i'm i work for ti
oh yes
what division are you in
oh
it's not a hobby you know it's something to do
i get to hear about texas again a bit
get to talk to people all over the country the other night i talked to someone in maryland i believe it was
it's interesting isn't it
you know the gal i talked to in maryland
didn't own a car she's never traveled anywhere she's never been anywhere she
you know i talked about one of the biggest problems in the united states being
our roads
and she didn't understand
she doesn't drive
she lives on campus college student
buses and
public transportation
her parents live by the public transportation
well it would be nice but i kind of like the freedom too don't you
right
if it's anything like
dallas always has been no one wants to be at downtown dallas much
is the crime rate still bad
oh
huh
yeah
huh that's terrible
so garland how nice is it now it's been a while since i've been there
yes it has
well yeah it is
where you from
kilgore i know where kilgore is
i'm originally from lubbock
yeah
seemed like the thing to do at the time
oh i love it the mountains
i love the mountains
back to the topic
it seems that
more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days
yeah
yeah everyone says
you know when i bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said no you're crazy to buy a mobile home
but now it seems that with the local economy bad and ti and straits it seems that
oh they're doing some backpedaling
no i'm renting at the time so
turns
yeah
well mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one
ours is wood ours is wood sided
and it has a traditional v top roof
and it's nine hundred and eighty square foot
one two bedroom one bath
rooms are nice sized
well you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into
two bedrooms one bath it's comfy
yes
i don't know whether it is or not
it was already setup when we bought it
oh yeah it's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere and
you know so it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be
oh our payments are like two
twenty
fifteen
and
what
yeah oh yes a mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper and
well actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used you know
three or four years used
well yeah did
no what i meant not in quality what i meant was
four years equity costs five hundred dollars
so you know there's not that much time left on the loan and
i
don't know
tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for
you know if i need to pickup and move somewhere else
somewhere else is easy
sure
sure absolutely
oh absolutely
when i you know when you talk about the deal like i got yeah
yeah it would be cheaper
especially if it were a paid move or something
you know there's some paid moves occasionally
i don't know but
they did when i when i moved up here so they might want to move away
six or seven
a little bit little bit mostly i just love walking the mountains driving in the mountains
oh that's exciting
i'm a little bit more against it than that because i see this as an absolute parallel to the mccarthy witch hunts when anybody who held
liberal opinions or supported civil rights was considered an evil satanic agent of moscow
quite often i there's the legitimate concern of people who are too stupid
not to use chemicals that can impair their behavior in a job
where they better be on top of things like running trains flying planes or driving buses
and also the strictures against driving while impaired should apply to any chemical of any kind whether the government has authorized the use of that chemical or not
and they take your license on the assumption that you're guilty which makes sense but this is not the issue here
it's not the issue in question though because what the government is trying to do is to truly impose thought control they are saying there are things you cannot do to your mind and body because we have not authorized to do it
and further more if we think that you are
we're going to make sure that you can't get a job or that you'll be fired from your job if you are engaging in this behavior
now blood tests aren't really being called for what they're doing is calling for piss tests which technically it's leaving your body but whatever it is they shouldn't even have the right to ask
they shouldn't have the right to prohibit these chemicals what they should have the right to prohibit is misuse of anything
yeah i think that it's just a witch hunt and that the people being hit the hardest are the ones that cause the least impact something like eighty percent
of the tests and the positive tests and the arrests contain concern marijuana the only commonly used drug that has no traceable deaths from overuse none even aspirin kills thirty two people a year
and if by all standards that can be compared potential for abuse general impact on society physical impact on the individual this drug should not be outlawed but the right wing does not want to hear talk like that
and so on top of that goes the whole republican drug testing intervention and control of your body attitude
an interesting side note of this is the motorola company lost eighteen months of development on the oh four oh chip because they instituted drug testing and the entire development team for that chip left the company
and that's why it took this long for the oh four oh to get out they scuttled their own boat and cost themselves millions of dollars for that
i'd say it's pretty much it's right to privacy the individual can do whatever they want as long as they don't negatively impact other individuals it is then that negative impact that should be looked at
not the not the direct cause of it it's under those grounds that we don't have alcohol prohibition or tobacco prohibition
yeah that's true too especially with tobacco
and alcohol they did try to ban it they failed utterly they failed miserably and led to the creation of the modern day mafia
and that's pretty much what's that's pretty much what's happened with other with the current prohibition
to tell yeah that we are getting a stray
well actually my hobbies now are t-shirt making i'm making t-shirts and sweat shirts in fact that's what i was doing when you called
right now i'm making christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing
no i'm have material that i cut out and then you
there's this stuff called wonder under that you that you iron it on and then you iron that on the t shirt then you paint around it so it's real fun i started doing it as a just something fun to do and now i'm selling them and
that's great pretty good i just started last week and i sold seven i really wasn't expecting that so
i guess in my spare time i'll be making t-shirts so
that's right you know
that's correct what are your hobbies
um-hum
oh my gosh
now how'd you learn to do that
to fix them up you just get a book that tells you how to do it or what
um-hum
where'd you get the car
wow
well that's true
that's true
well that sounds neat
let's see
well let's see i've done other hobbies i'm a hobby person i've always done a lot of craft stuff i always have done needle point and cross stitch and all that and
i collect dolls i have a huge collection of dolls which is still in new mexico with my parents uh-huh i'm from new mexico
so
let's see what else i started collecting music boxes i guess that's a hobby
so
probably about twenty
um-hum
they all play different songs
the most expensive i don't know i've gotten all of them for gifts i don't i've probably only bought a few of them i usually get them for christmas gifts or
and like when people go you know to on trips or something
so that's pretty neat
never collected those
i have dolls from all over too that i started when i was a little girl and i have a lot of dolls people would always bring them when they'd go to the countries and
and i did that when i went to europe one summer i bought a doll everywhere we went so
it's about to come to me it was great it was quick i was in the it was in high school it was in a tour and we went all it's kind of a
it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries and it's called people to people and we'd stay in people's homes and then we got to also tour big cities and i really enjoyed it
uh-huh it was in high school
but it really
exactly that's true
yeah that's true
no i always thought i would but who knows now i got married and
well he likes it all right he's been pretty good because there's t-shirt stuff all over the house
a real like strict dress code as far as you know suits and everything i can wear pretty much what i want as long as it's decent
you know i can wear blue jeans i can wear a dress i can dress up
so it just depends on the mood i'm in and where i'm going you know if i got a customer coming in then i'll dress up if not you know hey
blue jeans
uh-huh
well that's all
yeah
oh we can't even wear shorts
oh no shorts are no go here you can't wear shorts you can't wear like halters and stuff like that and to me really you can't wear anything that's
outside clothing you know like for the summer time and in the winter time i guess you can pretty much wear what you want as long as it's presentable that's what i consider
you know just don't get too outrageous here
and not too dressy like you know after five stuff i've some of them get sort of touchy too so
and the women you see you have you can't wear halters or nothing like that i mean at all
like even if you got a jacket on you got to have a bra on and all that stuff
i really would to save a lot of money if you had a uniform
because when i while i was in the service and see i had clothes that i could wear whenever i got ready but
nope
that's right
i wouldn't mind having a uniform people think i'm crazy but
uh-huh
that's right
yeah because it doesn't mess up your clothes either
you know because like at work if something gets on my clothes and ruins it it's just ruined
yeah well see if you work at a fast food because i work at wendy's sometime on the weekends
there's no big deal
but you know of course ti i'm sure if they ever went to uniforms they're not going to just give them to you
yeah the yeah that's what they are too
yeah
yeah because they're always in the high space up you know working on stuff
um-hum
yeah well see i just have my the whole building is computerized okay and so it's all air conditioned but my computer is like by my desk and then
you go to another cube and then somebody else's but the computer rooms now they're real cold and i don't have to work in one of those
yeah
oh well then yeah it's
no matter
and seems like it kicks in extra hard
um-hum
cold huh
i think the reason why we can't wear shorts is because then the women and the men would be in competition
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
you kidding me those are real good for men to wear so
um-hum
now my boss now he golfs every weekend
so he's got different outfits
and he cracks me up with these color codes
so
yeah uh-huh
now oh yeah
yep
no just when they go to play golf
now i think now ibm has a strict dress code when i went to apply for them before i came here and men they used to have to they have to wear white shirts i don't care what their job is they have to wear a suit
and see to me i think that's ridiculous because you're working with all that xerox machines and stuff like that all that black ink huh-uh no give me a break dude no i think them people should be able to wear blue jeans
you know because that stuff gets really bad
yeah
they have a dress
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
god
i don't think that should be your hair i mean yeah i guess so because some people do get wild with their hair
i don't know
it's funny because my son is fifteen
and he's into this fading crap you know
the fade like it looks like no hair
i tell him he's got to have hair all over or none one or the other you know you're not going to be going around with nine hundred ninety nine parts in your head and people's names carved in your head and
i told him no hum-um we can't have that
i'm not one of them liberated parents i guess i don't know
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
it sure is i play at least three times a week
i'm on it
no
well i'm one of those rare left handed golfers
and i do enjoy playing
right now it's three
well if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down
well we can usually play here year round
sometimes in january it's not too comfortable to play
but there's usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play and i'm pretty much addicted to golf so
i get out there one way or the other
it's a good game though it's very challenging and the reason i like it so much is because i'm
essentially playing against myself
that's the way i look at it i play in a lot of groups and but i
they keep score and
between themselves but i really don't care i go out and each shot i say well this is what i'm gonna try to do and then i see how close i can come to that
yeah and inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another either i'm not driving very well or i'm not hitting long irons very well or i'm not putting well or
but sometimes it all comes together
well we just had the tour championship here in pine hurst
and i went to that and craig statler won in the play-offs
but we this is a big golf area
we have a lot of
pretty well designed and then of course pine hurst and
we still have the greensboro open here every year
yes we do as a matter of fact it it's only been that way in the last five years but now you most of the courses have a
two day advance tee time you have to call
that's some cold golf too isn't it
we have cold
usually january and the first two weeks in february
but last week we were in the seventies and
something's coming through now so it's like in the low forties right now
but it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties
we have very windy winters
but we don't get any snow anymore i don't i don't know what changed that pattern we used to get
four or five inches a year now we get nothing it's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall
no but i have played golf in the snow before
yep get out my orange golf ball and go out and
and after the fact the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it
what do you think is pennsylvania kind of out of line there
what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying income tax on something that you purchase mail order
well i mean it seems to me that
generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania it's because
i'm sorry the commonwealth of pennsylvania it's because i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so i go outside the area for that
and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed
even though you know the revenue stream went to another state i don't i don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer
well i think that if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion
right but the point is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question that's a cost of doing business the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer
ah
do you mean businesses from the point of view as of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax
or purchasing
yeah see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't i never see that end of the business
so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer
but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that
the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something can be avoided
about the only memories that i have of boating my husband's family had a motor boat when we got engaged
and they took us out on the lake several times and i really did enjoy that i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything but we did some water skiing of course and
driving around the lake in the boat and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting
you know they you they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever the
the laws were there and if you didn't obey them
you know there were a lot of accidents i guess but i found the motor boating was real fun
oh
that sounds like a real challenge
uh-huh
hm
yes i do believe that there is too much immigration now
did you
well it's not just that are there enough jobs for people here now
and yet they're letting more people in daily
yeah i wasn't talking about just mexico i was talking about europeans the eastern block
it's terrible
there's and there's nothing we can do about it
the government seems to do as they wish when they wish
are successful
i saw it on the news yes the bulk of immigrants legal immigrants to this country are successful you know they pay to end up as tax paying citizens
making
above middle class income whatever that is in the united states now
well yeah you work for ti
they say that's due to their work ethic
now i don't know if that's true or not it just might be a matter of luck
but then america always has been
for the immigrant
huh none of us would
yeah
there you know there's only a very few native americans here
yes they are
well most of them you're right but then i drive through riodosa
and i think well not all of them have it
desperately bad
you know you've driven by
you know the mountain gods outside of riodosa haven't you
oh it's beautiful country up there in the mountains of new mexico
oh just gorgeous and that inn is huge and
but now like i say
that one tribe is the exception not the rule
you know most tribes were treated dreadfully
and still are yes
oh a native texan
oh
well i'm a native born texan but you know how it is
we go where the work is
in lubbock
yeah in seventy four
so yes i am i am a long time tier
the ones we see are americans by marriage a huge number here in colorado springs there's an air force base and an army base
so there's
people that marry gis korean americans german americans a few japanese
few chinese you understand
yeah
well that's not really immigration
yeah
yeah you can't stop them and once they're here to some extent we support them
i don't either but what i suspect is that illegals were hired
for a hundred and fifty years of texas history i don't think they can stop it by a federal edict
i don't think the federal government can stop it by waving their magic wand and saying it will happen no more it's just too inbred in the culture you know
i grew up in dumas and lubbock and every roofing crew was illegal
sure
see
still some migrant labor is legal
you know
it is in texas too
yes yeah during cotton harvest and whenever the tomatoes and all are
well
well the truth of the matter is i don't know what your home payments are but you couldn't make a living on what they earn
you could not
have you seen how those poor people live
migrant labor camps oh my god they live in cardboard boxes
and i
yes
and i don't hold it against the people
they're hard workers trying to make it
no
no they'll ask for a handout first
no what they're doing is they're asking for handouts
because if you took them into your home to work in your yard or whatever they'd know where your house is and how to break in then
or
now that's not true of all of them there are
i don't i don't know but i'm sure that times being as hard as they are
and times are hard
not everyone's that way
you know good people are being put out of jobs now
from ti
oh so you don't
oh and you got transferred to a different
right
yeah i've noticed
rumors still persist i try not to believe them and listen to them but they still persist that the plant will close
yeah so you're in division what now corporate okay yeah that must feel somewhat safer
bumping and
uh-huh
um-hum
oh you're in new york i was gonna there's a place if you ever make it to dallas they have the best prime rib it's called lawry's like lawry's seasoning salt and it is absolutely wonderful
oh is it okay
wow
uh-huh
so that's i think italian and mexican food are probably my favorites
uh-huh
oh okay
uh-huh
oh yeah get fresh seafood down there
uh-huh
but it sure is good and it's supposed to be good for you
right
uh-huh do you like spicy foods or
oh uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yep
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah those are the things i like the most i like fish and chicken the most
unless it is unless it is i catch a fish and i prepare it
and then i just you know i just broil it and put lemon on it
um-hum
sesame seeds and bread crumbs
yeah
right uh-huh
oh yeah uh-hum
oh there's a restaurant called string bean on spring valley and central
i like that it's just it's just home cooking
um-hum
right exactly uh-huh and that's the other restaurant also think they got black eyed pea
so
i don't like greasy places
yeah
right and i and i got
chicken marinara the last two times you know
it was i was great because that's what i like i don't like it you know it's like a baked
you know a piece of chicken and then i get like
green beans and mashed potatoes
you know
um-hum
no that's true
yeah
yeah my brother tried to make a bunch of things way back he tried to make bagels one time
and the dog never you know he treated it like a milk bone and he never did finish it he barely made a dent in it
and then he tried to make grapefruit citron one time
it's supposed to be a candy
and it didn't turn out very well it was you know
it like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into
into a kind of a candy stick so
um-hum
um-hum
huh
well you have to put eggs and everything don't you or
yeah just about
uh-huh use about half the sugar or
make everything diet
mostly i just cook for myself
um-hum
it's easy that's for sure
yeah
hum yeah i always put cheese on them
um-hum
yeah
but you know there's hardly any i guess there's hardly any protein it's mostly starch
fills you up and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get
oh yeah it really is
then you have to make a salad or
um-hum
right
um-hum
except you get to taste the product instead of
oh yeah
right
uh-huh
did you let the can cool off
yeah
huh yeah
right
that everything is paid
and that's basically my budget
so we use credit cards and let's see what else and when i get a
when i get a bill in the mail i write a check out for it immediately
put a date on the outside of the envelope stick it in my little franklin planner
and
i carry it around and then on the day that i'm supposed to mail it why mail it and that way i know how much i'm in the hole
oh wow
oh yeah
yeah
now you have a consensus
ahead of time huh
ah that's very good i've i'm i tried that in the beginning and when i say tried it i we tried to sit down there was no consensus
how many years now
let's see
twenty six twenty seven years now
well it's what it is it's just a kind of a commitment not to spend too much
the but the budget idea sounds pretty good i think if we ever
had one of these financial crisis you know like a oh
are what i do with her is i we have two bank accounts
one i wanted to
i wanted her to learn how to balance her checkbook because she's
she just
want it just tell me how much is in your account
and so finally we got we have one of these things where we get money
the company puts makes a direct deposit
i think that's good
i think that's good one of my friends suggested that
that life would be a little easier around our house even yet if i had her do that because
yeah it is that guy that does the traveling show that's on broadway and everything now
yeah that's supposed to be great i don't know as long as there lawyers making up the majority of the state legislatures and the national congress
i'm afraid not unfortunately
but i don't know it just it's pretty disgusting every time you
it it's not just the unethical part of it it's the self-serving part of it
that bothers me about the politicians they're all out
either for a particular controlled interest group of some kind or maybe several and rather than really honestly decide issues on the basis of what is good for the country
everybody decides them with this the constituency in mind or afraid that they're gonna hack off the wrong group or the other vote wise
and yeah exactly and so we if we just limited terms senators especially
and even supreme court judges this appointing them for life is just absurd they wind up senile old men making decisions at eighty years old
just say that the most you can serve is a couple of terms and then get in there and then you could get in there and do the best possible job that you really feel like you should be doing and then you're out of there and go on to something else instead of this
yeah i know
i just think we ought to we limit the president why not terms of the others and give there's plenty of other qualified people to run
um-hum
exactly
hm
yep
yeah that's probably true
i haven't
yeah i don't
well that's it when the very people making the laws are gonna be the ones who would have to pass those against themselves it sort of
goes without saying that it'd be awfully tough unless you could get the best thing that could happen to the state legislatures would be to be full of just
independent businessmen or just businessmen working for companies that could somehow get their salary made
at the present time we have none we intend to purchase a pup in two months
yes
no we've
my we we've got a five year old but we've had one pet since we've had her but he didn't quite work out
so
we are we've been now petless for a couple of years and
we're going to get another one this summer we're we've a got a vacation planned and we want to wait until we get back from the vacation before we
bring a puppy in
yeah
what type
uh-huh
goodness
right
yeah they're big dogs
yeah are they primarily outdoor dogs
yeah
and the scratches and the smell and the wherever yeah
i firmly believe that large dogs are meant to be outside we had danes when i was a child and
and we had our danes in the house
and we went through a time period that we had three danes
we had
yeah and we had we had a litter
and she had thirteen puppies
eight of which survived and
and she we ended up keeping one of those puppies
we had the mom the dad and one of the puppies and it was horrendous
we wound up getting get getting rid of the mom selling the puppy and just keeping the dad because dad was the favorite one anyway
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
oh
yeah
we had a schnauzer that got milk fever right after the babies were born and we had to feed all their feed all the babies there were five and there were four of them that survived
yeah
yeah she did survive
no
no she didn't even she did not even take the this is the laziest dog that ever lived
when she had these puppies she crawled up onto my mother's stomach in the middle of the bed
had the puppies and woke up my mother
to cut the sacks off she didn't even lick the sacks off laziest dog on earth she never she never nursed them she never cleaned them she never did anything to them they were like they didn't exist
yeah
yeah they just poop and it's yeah they
yeah
like a nice aquarium
oh yeah
yeah
that's great
the cat was always happy
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
we've we'll probably get real small cairn terrier
and it'll probably be an indoor outdoor dog
but see my oldest is five and a half and so she can take part in some of the
responsibilities a three and a half year old really can't quite take part of many of the responsibilities maybe feeding them
oh she's got respect for animals thank goodness
uh-huh
yeah
i think that's eighteen months
i mean i think that's just kids trying to figure out you know what's going to happen and it will happen again and again and again
yeah
yeah it has to be a real mellow kind of animal that can
survive it and child
well that's what you i mean that's what you need in a pet if your going to have small children too
but
we
oh wonderful
you know i just did last week as a matter of fact i'm wondering if their subject is more products by mail or things that you buy at the store but
i bought something through the mail through a merchant through a company that's generally got pretty good products and
post office or some place to return it usually
it was hannah anderson the children's clothing
do they
it really is
it took a while because it was the holiday weeks
it was difficult to know when the person was going to arrive we're fortunate in that my husband works most of the time out of our home so he was here but
it would've probably been an inconvenience if it had been a home pickup and we hadn't been here but they were also willing to pick up at work
it was defective we returned it for the same thing in a little larger size but it seemed that it was stitched around the collar such that the second time she wore it ripped
and i think that's unusual for that company because they do usually have pretty good products but to answer the question that we were posed about whether things tend to be poor quality i think definitely i think a lot of the things that
are not necessarily low price tend to be manufactured in a lot of cases as if they were lower priced
um-hum
yeah
exactly yeah and it it's unfortunate you really cannot depend on the department store's name for that necessarily i don't know if you have nordstroms in dallas
um-hum
they are really nice stores and i think i assumed in the beginning that they would probably carry overall pretty good merchandise you have to be just as careful there as you do at any other lower priced store
yeah surprisingly
no
um-hum
um-hum
you know i don't know that i bet they probably do but i i'm not sure that i've
associated some of what i've seen as lines that they always carry as their own brand or just something that they've gotten at a at a lower price because it's a large volume some of their children's lines
i tend to look there for kids' things because they don't they sometimes have things that you can't find elsewhere because they have a pretty large variety but not often for myself
and you don't always have the convenience of returning it if it's not right i tend less often to do that today than i might've ten years ago
um-hum
exactly
um-hum
um-hum
whereas you might take a chance in a store and bring it home and consider it you
you find that it's a lot more inconvenient to have to arrange for returning it if it's by mail
yeah it is funny you know i'm also amazed at
that's what
um-hum
right well they've been independent candidates before but never
as popular as he seems to be and i mean it seems to be doesn't really matter who it is it's just that fact that he's not in either party
that seems to be why he's so popular i guess
hm
well if we i mean sticking with this topic
i would just say that you know it's interesting that it doesn't really seem to matter what his views are you know i mean he seems to have some views which are pretty conservative and which are pretty liberal
but it seems like people are more interested in just the fact that he's an alternative you know than to
to what you know i guess he hasn't really outlined a platform yet you know and people keep asking him you know what do you feel is the a plan to deal with the budget or blah
and he really doesn't have any answers i guess but that doesn't stop his popularity from swelling you know people are just sick and tired of everyone else i guess
it seems to be i don't know it's kind of like people always
they're always they're always trying to find third alternatives like
you know limiting number of years in office for instance
but you know all they have to do is vote him out of office you know it's almost like they want to be forced to vote the way that they
it seems strange
right
exactly
hm
chances are what do you think how much of the vote do you think he's going to get and do you think he will take it more from the republicans or the democrats
um-hum uh-huh
right
exactly
um-hum
personally i have a i have a problem with
have problems seeing what he and i would have in common you know
yeah
he's for the concept of life in prison without parole
yeah he upsets people up here every time he does it i don't what it is down in florida these days
yeah mario up here is claiming that
on appeal then another appeal then another appeal ends up costing the taxpayers more than just putting the guy away for the rest of his life with no chance of parole
so you know if it comes down to a money issue
i you know in that case then i'm all for putting them behind bars as long as there's no chance of parole but you know what it's like when they
yeah they fill the court the jails up and suddenly let them go and they're back on the street we had this murder up here
art shawcross up in rochester killed nineteen prostitutes up here
and he was let out on parole from up in
watertown and
he was just well actually he it was on purpose i guess
he was he was a real psycho though and as a matter of fact it this happened under cuomo's watch so the bush administration was thinking if cuomo is going to run for president they were gonna do instead of
yeah instead of willie horton now we have the art shawcross deal you know
yeah well of course you know we have new york city up here i'm in being in rochester we're kind of
they consider us more in canada than in new york state area
but up here you know we have we don't have too many serious problems with crime but i know in new york city it was a real it's a big deal they would like to have it back
they're building more prisons up here to try and put people in attica is not too far away
from where we are and that's at capacity and of course you know new york city is just packed with criminals that have done everything
so i you know i don't where it's going to go to in the end i just think that
yeah i we heard that yeah
okay well i heard dallas is pretty bad with the crime
uh-huh
um-hum the same way here in dennison i mean back a couple weeks ago they found
some people i don't -member at some fast food restaurant they had been i can't -member if they been shot or if they just been thrown in the freezer but i'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast food restaurant
and i've worked in fast food restaurants they don't have that much money on hand they really don't
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right my husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager
and he well i don't know he decided not to work one night or something and one of the guys that
was working was shot and kenny quit the next day he just he couldn't deal with it
uh-huh
everywhere
um-hum
it just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though the worst part of it
i lived in louisville kentucky for a while i lived on the outskirts too but louisville was pretty especially during like the
kentucky derby at this time of the year it's horrible to live in louisville
but
uh-huh
the ones that blink off and on for the self i mean
right
uh-huh
how many kids do you have
oh a boy or
oh that's what i've got it is scary are your are they babies or
oh well good that they're a comfort to you i've still got babies i've got
i'm used to living in which we don't live in the city but we just
it's still more crowded than what i'm used to i'm used to having you know eight or ten houses on one street and this one's got houses on either side and you know real close together and just
right
they
well the one of them's a teenager lives next door and her friends are pretty wild
they've stolen gas out of our vehicles and well he went and got a locking gas cap for his they weren't stealing it out of mine so much because my car the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to siphon gas out
so he went and got a locking gas cap and they tried to break that off he
well we can't say they did but
we're pretty yeah
it had to be somebody that you know could do it in the middle of the night and you know they'd seen it earlier
um-hum
well the only things that we can do as citizens is you know like those watch groups that they'll have but they can be dangerous too and i've thought about it you know
this isn't like walking around and looking for somebody you can get yourself into trouble
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well i watched it on tv oh i guess last year sometime they'll break in at the day in the daytime and
i hear that you know it if you lock yourself out of your house and you try to get in your house it'll you give that half the time it takes you to break in a professional could break in half that time
yeah it is
because my husband'll leave every once in a while for he works on the railroad and i'm scared here by myself so
and loud
um-hum
uh-huh
now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog that's a deterrent because they know that dog's going to bark
but it's easy to fool a dog too you know throw them meat or
it's a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat
yeah it was
and maybe we'll meet up again alrighty bye-bye
yes
well yes in fact we have had a minor problem we've we tried to use the child care facility at the tennis club that we belong to and just didn't feel that it provided the kind of quality care that we want for our child at this point
so it is in fact difficult to find quality services
no my wife doesn't work so we were just planning on trying to use that as a as a break in our activity and to give her a little more free time
but the center that we went to had we've felt like had too many children for each counselor and so you know any child that had any kind of problem or was just upset wasn't going to receive the kind of attention that we wanted our child to have
and i'm sure that's the problem with many care centers like that
it's a difficult task to provide you know reasonable cost child care
no it was i think it was four dollars an hour
what i was what i was thinking of was that you know for the
for the sitter to be able to provide low cost care they you know they can't pay too much for the counselors and
can't provide too many counselors per child
but it's you know we're used to
used to just felt more comfortable
with
you know with more of a babysitter situation where the child has the full attention of someone
right
right
yeah
right
hm
right
right
right
yeah it's difficult i don't know whether we'll find it easier when the child gets a little bit older say one year old when it doesn't seem quite so vulnerable
to you know to the outside world and my wife keeps wondering you know how anybody can turn the child over to
day care and i just tell her that you know it's just it's not a matter of choice for most people we're fortunate we have a choice
right
right
yeah
yeah
yeah it does make it difficult to because now our child's six months old and
you know essentially my wife hasn't been away from him from more than a few hours at a time
so that takes its emotional toll on her
yeah we think so we think that is important we're just not sure at what
okay based
uh-huh
uh-huh
right i think if it's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody
you know when they answer the company i think it'll make it a lot easier and they'd run into less problems
right
uh-huh
oh gosh any people who had tested positively getting them into a drug program or rehab program
and anybody who gee is you know doesn't accept the rehab program then they're more or less getting laid off
i think that's really hard to because you know you never know i don't know it's it that's a it's really weird issue i'm sort of on the fence about it
but i you know that that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow oh we can get you into a drug program but then you wear that stigma you know
where like a lot of people are saying well i only smoked a joint last night i don't have any problems you know or something like that yeah
right anything with an a you know if you drink a lot of caffeine or yeah somebody was saying telling me if you drink it in you know an awful lot of caffeine that can show up as a positive test
uh-huh
yeah it hits me as the orwell thing big brother is watching
orwell
and you know his book big brother is watching
because i feel there'd be more trust in the employees
but i can understand why they need it with all the you know train accidents and everything else
i think they will too because you know it's just going to follow
i don't know i we haven't had any of it in our school system
right
well and eventually it's going to be not only the you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers
and if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids
and then they've you know caught everybody
yes
yeah it snowed this morning and it was all gone by noon
well i don't know yeah i guess it's not really cold
oh yeah
like the usenet news groups
oh yeah i saw it on something called comp dcom telecom
i'm a county engineer i look mostly at sewage
oh yeah
well we'll see
hey whatever you like
okay
all right taxes well
i think people are not getting the money's worth and number two i think people aren't willing to pay good money for a decent value
so i got to blame everyone on that
well i think there's some entrenched greed in general mismanagement in government
well we've you know we've got a lot of people who are dedicated and trying to do a good job but we've also got a lot of people that think the world owes them a living and you know they don't want to do anymore than they've
you know than they did last week or they don't want to do any more than the least they can possibly do they have no pride no pride at all
yeah well there's a lot of money in that and where there's a lot of money there tends to be a lot of
what is it greed deceit mismanagement
who was it who wrote animal farm george orwell
absolute power corrupts absolutely
it seems to me that there's this basic idea that you shouldn't let people starve to death
and that you should have some sort of
christian charity toward them
and that people just aren't willing to let people starve to death in the streets if they don't want to work
and therefore they're not willing to change the systems
i got another theory if you want to hear it it's not really mine just that the powers that be mainly you and me
are keeping this whole class of people poor and helpless just so they're out of the way
well we're definitely keeping them poor and down trodden and helpless
you don't think the welfare system fosters a whole class of people that
yeah
i mean it
yeah and you know i sort of i feel a bit guilty about that because you know i vote
and i'm not agitating against it i'm not agitating for it that's for damn sure can i say that on this
lucille hughes
all right and what
yes
um-hum
well i certainly am too now tell me what you expect from the mavericks this year
yes sir
ah well do you think it's time that we go for new coaches is that part of our problem
well it just it's so discouraging that they can't really i mean they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far
i i'm awfully sorry that the mavericks can't come on and do roy who's your next best team or who do you like after the mavericks
well
we certainly need to support them do we not do you go to the game
well
yes it does i'm sure it would it's such a monstrous place down there but maybe next maybe they can do some i don't know who do they need to trade
yes sir it seems that way to me i course i don't know any of the newer ones that they have and i'm not well of versed on their capabilities but we really need to do something
i really
yes sir
and they have just done as much as they can for that man and he apparently can't straighten his act out so we need to build on something more positive than that
oh i do too i certainly would agree to that
that's right
well
it is tragic i don't i mean we're gonna have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes i think
it
yes sir
i think you're right i believe that one so
i don't see any problem with testing for random drugs
um-hum
yeah
well i'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon and i just came from saint paul interviewing with three m
and they have a policy for testing if you if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start
and i guess the only
drawback i can see to drug testing is in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result
then there could be some sort of problem but
yeah
right
electrical engineering
oh wow
they test you before they before you start or before you even interview or
uh-huh
oh
what happens if you were to fail then do they give you like one more chance or two more chances
um-hum
no i'm just about to finish my masters in may and just interviewing with companies right now
um-hum
oh
do they test you at right now at work too
okay
um-hum
wow is it formal policy that they said that they might test
okay but you said you saw robin hood
yeah have you are you planning to see the his new one the jfk
yeah i usually wait for the reviews too although sometimes i've gone and i disagree
you know with them not usually the paper as much as the ones on radio and tv i don't always agree with them
um-hum
oh like the man on the i think it's krld that reviews movies gave star trek the new movie like a four or five
and i was surprised because everyone that's a star trek fan that i know that has seen it just loved it
um-hum so don't you think again it's a matter of opinion
i don't like always to listen to what someone else says because i think sometimes they just don't happen to or if you know if you're real tired sometimes something doesn't appeal to you
that's right i've seen a couple like that you haven't seen cape fear yet
oh it is very frightening i mean i think it's more so than silence of the lambs it's a little bit like that did you see silence of the lambs
yeah well it was pretty gory and so was cape fear real kind of gruesome
but you know that's kind of like when is he going to die and probably never
which one is that
hook yes again i've heard mixed reviews on that you know i think this morning krld had a gave it a six or something which for him is probably pretty good
i guess there'll never be another et
i know that was a classic and i'm glad they didn't try to follow up with a sequel sometimes it ruins it
well i think so it was on what thanksgiving i was in florida and i watched it again have you seen the butcher's wife
uh-huh
um-hum he does put in a real good the it's a real lighthearted movie if you're in the mood to see something just kind of lighthearted you would like it isn't a real thoughtful picture
just kind of fun you know once in a while it's nice to just go see something that's just lighthearted and fun
um-hum they really do and i've never been a star trek fan but i have friends and relatives that wouldn't miss a star trek movie
yeah
well and sometimes you know you miss all the crowds if you don't have to go the very first day it opens
yeah
yeah i think so i don't think you need to be one of the first do you belong to any of the fan clubs you know the
um-hum
yes well it'd be interesting to hear why people think that
i'm fifty three most of my big vacations i think are probably in the past i've been you know to europe a couple of times and
and to
rio huh
oh okay england holland france
one of the most interesting ones was berlin we were there for five years and this was back in eighty five before you know the wall came down
so that was very interesting to go into
you know a communist country and all that course it's kind of laughable now but you know that's the way it was then
five days i'm
five days
my husband's brother was the commander of the air force base in berlin
and so we were visiting them
we went there for about ten days and that was quite a beautiful place
and so
to
yeah and to visit relatives my brother worked lived in jamaica for a number of years so we went there you know for a week so
yes uh-huh in fact that's probably where we'll go in the remaining years we'll probably just stay right here in this country for we i think we could afford more back then than we can now
we're caught in this economic crunch
we also had a time share condo if you're familiar with those so we used and it was our home unit was in vail colorado
and then if you didn't want to go there you could switch and go actually anywhere -where in the world
yeah a little but we waited we were too old when we started going to really learn the you know like our children learned well and skied well but you know
that's something you really i think should learn when you're younger
you know you wait until you're forty five and start learning to ski well then you're afraid you're going to break something
now i've done all the talking you tell me what you've done
well you're much younger what age are you
well that is young go ahead
yeah but that was the trend back then you know
you had your children in the early twenties
oh
oh and such beautiful country up around you
oh
right
oh
um-hum and they you can take children now can't you
yeah okay i knew i knew something about that uh-huh
good grief that's just almost unaffordable isn't it
well i wonder if they couldn't just provide interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that might be a step in the right direction i don't know
uh-huh
you mean the employers uh-huh
because everybody's competing for jobs
well i used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do i have to think about it some more now because my doctor is actually he's canadian
and he told me that there're a lot of lot of counts against the canadian system which is basically the one people are talking about for here i don't understand the arguments exactly he says it restricts your choice
of doctors and so forth i'm not quite sure i understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does
i mean we're on a private insurance plan right now actually i have my own business and we our health insurance is through my wife's employer
and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to and where we can buy or medicine and
and it changes every year it's always so confusing so
um-hum
well yeah
of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the limits of compensation but of course that is restricted choice so
i don't think that the restricted choice really
has to do with the difference between public and private health insurance i think it has to do with the attempt to limit cost doesn't it and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way so
well i guess the most sensible thing i've heard about this is they say people are trying you have to recognize that if you're going to
have the very best health care possible and available on demand whenever and wherever you want it then it's gonna be expensive
and if you wanna pay less then you're gonna have to settle for a health system that is not quite that lavish
and
yeah well what happened to reagan's safety net anyway did he take that back to california with him
yeah they'll be needing you in a couple of years because they're running out of kids down there at the other end and
well if they're smart
uh-huh
right
well i just heard i guess
well
i mean i don't know i think i think i'm worth twenty five million if he is but
as far as
i mean if they're going to pay nolan ryan four and a half million i mean yeah he's definitely worth it just because i mean ryan's only got a couple good years left in it where sierra's got at least another ten or fifteen years but
i mean that
well the problem is you have tom house who is going to he'll blow their arms out i mean
and sierra i mean those pitchers
you got a they've got to resign them just to keep the credibility of this franchise i mean because if they don't resign them i mean that's pretty much going to be the last straw they've kept valentine way too long
and it's you know i don't think i mean he's even said he you know that probably will not sign for as much as bonilla did but i mean
because apparently he's he he's real into arabian horses and one of the minority owners is a big time
arabian horse dealer or whatever and he's i guess there has been some he'd want he wants to stay out here and get some land and develop that because
i was listening to a show the other night apparently he doesn't want to he doesn't really have the stomach to go into a large market and have to prove himself all over again but
he's got it made if he just stays there so he'll probably stay and
oh i'll stay for a million but
you know if somebody that's going to pay it i mean you might as well i you know can't blame him for taking it i mean that's
uh-huh
i still follow it and everything but it's just
yeah it's the only thing going in the summer but football is definitely a little bit more exciting right now but i mean you know
oh yeah i agree
yeah that's one thing that's
yeah the worst is when they kick the ball off after when it's a commercial after they score a touchdown
then they kick it off
then the commercial after that they bring them you know that's the one commercial i think they need to eliminate
yeah someone's got to pay for it but
well i think they're just hoping something happens to them like happened to atlanta which is a fluke i thought anyway
yeah
okay you got another call
okay
oh yeah
i mean with the lineup they have
probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching reasonable doubts which had a you know capital case in it
mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day
well
i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation
but i do know that some people
almost all people usually die before that point
they just get too old
as far as capital punishment on it's own merits
if you're black and you kill a black guy you know it's you know two hundred hours of community service
yeah
well it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship
you know we're the majority so we can do whatever the hell we wanna do
and you're the minority and you're stuck with it
but the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent
the handwriting's on the wall there isn't it
you know
as far as capital punishment
i think that ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment i think the guy should have ninety days
and if he can't produce evidence not argument but evidence
in england you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent
and
once they found you guilty you know the judge said he's guilty kill him
well there were some people that had a problem with that
because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed and he'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me
and or he'll have somebody lie for him you know people lie it's a strange thing but they do that
and
to prevent that kind of misuse of power
they wrote into the constitution a protection against judicial mishap
and the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy look at that guy at e systems
they were they convicted him
of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit
he was too far away when it happened he had witnesses that were you know they weren't dope dealers they weren't drug fiends they were employees of a
an establishment that had a very high level of security sensitivity and these were really responsible people
you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy
you know they all look the same to me you know
big lips flat nose yep that was him
okay well let's see invasions of privacy actually
i can't think of too many except oh occasionally my employer
or
sometimes it seems of a bit of an invasion when i when i get calls from phone solicitors
like well
i i've discovered it's kind of fun to try to
take control of the conversation
like you know typically
they're reading from a script
so if you start asking questions right away
or do anything that's a little out of the ordinary they get really thrown
so like often what i'll do is i'll call up and say
and what's the name of your company you know and this by this time they're really shook up and then
i ask her carla could i have your home telephone number please
yeah well another thing you can do is you can pretend that you got them on call waiting
ah
yeah and those are used as pin numbers a lot like with my bank
if i want to move money around over the phone or check my balance or anything the pin number they want is the last four digits of the social security
really
i didn't know that huh
well now where do they use the stripe
oh you mean like when a cop pulls you over he runs it through a reader
really
yeah well like the stores can probably develop their own databases but they can't get into the department of motor vehicles
i'll bet that's it
yeah because they
well then you know about caller id
yeah
hey did you get did you get the number for this off of the internet
oh okay
yeah most of the most of the people i talk to on here are on internet
yeah did you get it off of telecom digest
oh yeah i read that constantly
yeah i post on there from work under paul cook at proctor and associates
and at home as tad cook
oh yeah well i got mine from a friend of mine owns a unix consulting firm and gave me a free account there a few years ago
so i can just dial it up and
yeah it's real neat
oh i'm yeah we're in actually almost exactly the same exchange i'm real near his office
but it's pretty neat he doesn't have a full uucp fee but i
i yeah i'm on this moderated one a mailing list
do you want to go first
well you go ahead
oh yeah
oh yeah uh-huh
oh it sounds fantastic
oh yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
is it cayenne pepper you mean
yes
uh-huh
yes
and how much shrimp would you use
two pounds okay
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
oh yeah
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
a glass dish uh-huh
okay uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
and it's are you cooking the whole head at one time okay
i see
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh that sounds fantastic
uh-huh
sure
and it's not much work
that sounds
oh yeah
sure
now how many could you serve
yeah okay i figured about that
oh that's good
see out here we have so many ethnic people we have italians and we have portuguese and we have russians and polish and
it depends out here like the type of people you're going to entertain
you know so it's hard you just have to pick something for the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time
and they're big on finger food here too you know chicken wings and ribs and that kind of stuff barbecue
and cooking out in the yard it you know when it's nice barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff
no but i have had shrimp
oh of course that's
yeah
really is it like shrimp
it's similar
oh it does
does it look like a lobster
oh it looks more like a crab oh
are they thin long
or wide
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah yep
and where did you say you were from
louisiana oh well do you do cajun cooking
oh i love blackened you know the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff oh we have a few places up here that do that
and if ever i see it on the menu i always get it
it is so good
now how do they do the blackened
but do you have to have a certain skillet or something
no
i did have i don't have it now but i have mostly teflon
you now but
does it have to get extremely hot
yeah
uh-huh oh i see
yeah
oh i see
oh
oh
oh really
oh now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time is that what you're saying
oh uh-huh
because i could have the chicken on the skewers
with blackened seasoning
and oh that is so good delicious
uh-huh
oh
it is i love it i in fact i was in texas for a little while and i liked the barbecues and the mexican food
i have a passion for all that type of different tastes because i have been brought up mostly italian american food because my parents are italian and portuguese
so we cook a lot of pasta and gravies and pizzas and you know roasts and that kind of thing that's why i enjoy going to restaurants and have you know trying different things
i would love to
i
really
uh-huh
is that right
uh-huh
now where do you go when you go there right on basin street and those places
uh-huh
oh
oh i see
oh that's nice
uh-huh
really
and don't they make a lot of i'm trying to think what they call their soup i don't know
yeah jumbo gumbo right is that with seafood
oh you can
that looks good too i've seen them the chefs on tv do that and oh it looks delicious
see we do a thing we call it a sea bake you take clams
i guess we're on
you usually get a message
hum
i don't know huh
okay
okay
yeah
well not really from you know i wasn't from here so the teams i really root for in football are the niners and the seahawks
yeah san jose actually but close
yeah
oh okay
okay is that where you are right now oh okay
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah it makes sense because you know you you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can you know do a bunch of different things
hum and i don't you know my main sport is baseball but you know you know i've been enjoying football but i don't know it as well
i just you know cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they is it is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the walker trade or what was the whole deal on that
oh that's right that's right they it went the other way what was i thinking they gave up they traded herschel to minnesota yeah okay my brain's really working well tonight
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah i mean
this is the way it is well kim i mean didn't the cowboys even finish they finished pretty close to five hundred last year didn't they
because they only won one game the year before right
okay yeah i enjoyed that because it was against the skins
no i live near baltimore and
talking about how they're going to get a baseball team and everything it's like you guys aren't going to get a baseball team i'm sorry it's not going to happen but of course you know the one the griping is that if you know if washington doesn't get a baseball team then baltimore shouldn't get a football team
which is probably true but anyway i just i've never liked dc a whole lot and i really hate the redskins and a lot of it's because you know i got a lot of people you know at work with and everything that are big redskin fans
yeah i've never liked philadelphia the city a whole lot the only reason i really enjoy the eagles at all is because i really like randall cunningham
well considering how well he gets along with jimmy johnson that doesn't surprise me
yeah there was
there was this there in the baltimore sun has this cartoonist in the sports section and
when last i guess it was january when jimmy johnson got named coach of the year or whatever
it was the same day that buddy ryan got fired
and he had this cartoon in there about jimmy johnson's big day you know the first thing is the phone call from the you know from the league saying he was
yeah
no i lived do you know what ellicott city is
it's just west of baltimore off route seventy
yeah but well route seventy and route forty
yeah well they've built a new baseball stadium downtown it's opening next year this little
the inner harbor
yeah it's a couple of blocks west there's a big
there is an old railroad yard basically there's a big long railroad shed and then there's an old station
but you know they're building the baseball stadium and they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get an nfl team
so it's real easy access from south of baltimore like you know like the airport or more importantly for the orioles from washington dc
because the orioles say they get twenty five percent of their population i mean their attendance from dc
um-hum
yeah they really ought to change the name i think in indianapolis i never been real thrilled with well i've
no i transferred to delaware and graduated there
yeah
yeah but it's close to philadelphia and baltimore so it's
kind of all over the place but mostly east coast lately
had a tremendously organized budget i've you know kind of know how much the monthly bills are by
you know looking at the previous month and i know about what the minimum payments are so i just kind of put it down on paper and
and estimate but as far as actually having a real tight organized budget that you stay within i've just always kind of freelanced as far as that goes
oh wow
you've got two now under four
i've got a senior in high school who's just getting out in may
yeah i'm forty four
and
we actually ran one checkbook with i mean one account with two checkbooks off the same account for a for a long time
but that's real dangerous when one is supposed to make a deposit and doesn't or writes an extra couple of checks and either forgets to tell the other one about it or something you know so we finally switched to
the two method too it seemed to work better
oh sure
well we been we each have our own business and so especially once that got established it was easier for her to run her deal and me to run mine and not really
mix the two and the you know bills that are
if we're both paying on a certain thing like the a school tuition then one or of the other of us writes the other one a check for their portion
and then one person mails it all you know to the to the bank or whoever
if it's something we're doing that way if it's if it's something that one or the other of us is handling in its entirety then we just pay it like you do
well
it's kind of the way it is it's never been like my brother is organized to the n-th degree he and i are exactly opposite he's two years younger than i am and
he budgets every penny he knows where every little thing is and he's a real tight wad with the money and i've always been a little looser
and we just kind of like you say if we need to watch it we watch it and not spend any you know big amounts of money
during a certain period of time if we got a little excess and decide to splurge and buy something you know then that's kind of a joint
thing too so
oh yeah those are
that'll do it everytime
i hadn't really heard that before
i had at one point thought about doing the peace corps myself many years ago
you know many years ago it seemed like they had involuntary enlistment and mainly like in the fifties i know a lot of men that were into the military you had to go into the military
i don't know about that a lot of people i don't think would like it because it's gonna interrupt college plans but a lot of people don't have plans so for them it might give them a little help to
get some kind of more awareness about the world and be of some use for a while
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i had a friend though in the seventies join vista
which is a similar program although you stay within the us which can be very beneficial too i mean a lot of times there's a lot of help we can do within the us and that
i just don't think they even i don't know if they have those programs anymore or if they even try to publicize it and recruit and i think that's a shame because both of those programs are excellent and
i don't remember i just i haven't seen it recently
right
yeah i think it would be extremely beneficial to just about everybody
i could see that there'd be some people that you know would throw up their arms about it and go i'm going to harvard and i you know this isn't something i wanna do but
um-hum
and i have had two little sisters and even though they were local to me it was almost being in a different world because both of my little sisters came from very poor backgrounds
so that was beneficial to me as well as the child because made me appreciate my background a little more and i helped to give this person
it's usually a year and they try to find somebody in the local area to you and you know the age group that you wanna work
what i was doing at home in fact i work at nights here so that's another long story we'll talk about
it's funny that i got you though
i asked my wife to hand me the other phone because i was just i was busy and i had just gotten a call and i couldn't answer it and i said well i'll punch it on this one
and it's a walk around phone but it's not a it's not the other kind you know
so it didn't work
okay
no i'm using a regular phone now
if it's a what kind of phone do they not a dial but if it's a touchtone it's okay
i realized that once i used i should have i was going to go in the kitchen and punch one on the touchtone
and i realized that i had screwed it up so it was my fault
that's funny that we had gotten it
i'll switch over to birds you know we don't really have birds as pets but we sure because we have cats
we always wind up with i haven't yet
a bird or two in the summer because the cat will catch one and usually we'll catch the cat because the cat doesn't seem to kill the bird right away
we wound up with a lot of birds over the years and
there are organizations we drop ours off at fort worth if they're still alive and you keep it alive which is hard to do for a couple of weeks
if you take it to an agency they'll send it back in the wild somehow and so we wound up because of our cats with many birds over the years again they're not pets exactly but
yeah
the lady next door across the street from us just lost
is it a cockatoo what's that one that's white
it got loose and i've forgotten what how she did it and she had it in a cage of some sort
and what they were doing i don't know but it flew away you know and they called it and everything and drove around the neighborhood looking for it but
yeah it's free yeah
i'm surprised that a bird i guess they can find their way back but i wonder exactly where a tame bird would go
no she never got it back i've heard stories like this before with parrots and all this because people let them out in their house you know and fly around
and
no i know
but i've forgotten she had it outside somehow and somehow they mixed signals or something and it got loose of course again the animals are so much faster than we are in one way or the other
you know i was telling you the story about fencing i do like dogs i would i've always had dogs my whole life as a kid
well yeah i do i
yeah i do i think that all the animals have personality i'm not the cat person i my sister had cats when we were little
we always seem to have a cat and a dog together which again when you bring them up i do notice that
they get along
and my wife was the cat lover and when we started out as a young married couple we just had an apartment so it's kind of easier to have a cat
and then she just never wanted a dog and then we got here to texas she's from texas again and
she had this thing with the fence and i guess i have so many
interests i don't really quite have the time with two daughters and everything
i certainly saw your point with the greyhound that there's there is a limit
to a pet
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah no i think so too my wife just she keeps convincing me because my parents my parents are dead now but my parents and my brothers and sisters always had dogs
and when we would visit them she said you can smell dog over the house i said well you're really right
and so i never she always had a good argument why not to get a dog and we haven't since we've been married
oh yeah
no i think you're right people are surprisingly are allergic to cats too we do have some friends on and off that will
i guess it's the cat the short fur on the cat is one of the allergic reaction things like
cedar trees and all of the other stuff i guess the cat has a real fine not the that the real short hair dandruff or whatever they have that people do get allergic to cats
in their eyes you know they just walk in the house even though we lock up the cats and they're crying
and so some people unfortunately of course i wouldn't have an animal if i was allergic to it either
my wife at one time said she was allergic to them
i was going to say a
well i think the animal's good for you just because it gets you out and everything i
oh yeah
oh yeah
right
i have some friends that have horses you know
and when my daughters were a little younger you know i thought well maybe that's a good maybe i'll get them you know this is texas and i'll get them a horse
well we went over and we rode their horses and everything but and just listened to the stories and the money
the horse was sick all the time
i don't know if you if you have any friends with horses but they get all kinds of eating disorders if they don't if they don't eat the right grain or if you
if you give him an orange or something you nearly kill it i mean it the stories he would tell it must have cost him a couple hundred dollars a month
of course he had several horses for shots and different things i thought my god and i just saw something interesting consumer reports they talked they had a animals and they compared
you know whether you should have a bird and the pricing and it had a comment around a horse something to the effect of
right i think the best thing in the world is to rent them i think that
that and boats are probably the same way i'd love to have a boat too but i think i'm not too sure i would get that much use out of it you know
my goodness from what
my goodness
yeah
oh yeah
yeah plus i'm not too sure yeah i think they are experiments too and they don't know that much
my sister spent a lot of go ahead
huh
hm
my goodness
yeah
oh yeah they're a problem the different rainy seasons here i don't how long you been here in the area
oh course you were here before
yeah
okay
oh really
yeah
oh really
oh
oh yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yes
right
right
i imagine in texas there would be a lot of steak restaurants is that right
yes
um-hum and now on this area of course here in maryland you're close to the chesapeake there seems to there is some there are some steak restaurants but they lean more towards seafood here
you probably have seafood a lot also
right well do you have crabs and lobster in that area that's
yeah that's
right and you probably have would you have crawfish
yeah
yeah
well a lot of what you said sounds similar to us i remember that before we had children we have
two boys that are like nine and six and actually the oldest one is just starting to
learn to behave in a restaurant so before we had kids we would
definitely dine out more frequently probably several times a week and it didn't have to be
necessarily anything fancy but it was more a matter of before children say we were both working we didn't feel like cooking we just went out
and now you know as you said once you've children that's not always an option i worked off and on you know because they were little and
and also you know once you're home and you have them
sometimes it's not worth it to go through the trouble of digging the sitters and everything just to go and so what i have found now that
you don't want to just necessarily run out for you know a one hour and come back i noticed with us it's more when we do go out then we do try to make it something nice maybe a dinner theater or nice restaurant with friends
sometimes lunches when we can do that that's okay too but
it definitely you know it definitely changes is changed we maybe eat in somewhat nicer places now but that's because when we do go
there's so there's a special quality to that because it is a few hours away from the kids
and but not as often we don't do it as often
and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into going again with them
and of course when you take them though you're going to go to something like a mcdonald's level or maybe a little bit of a family style restaurant
but in this area there are quite a few decent restaurants that are not too expensive and
i tend to agree with you too we look for more
yelling and you know you look for different things and that crowd seems to change and you know you're not as much part of it
and you don't there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs you know and that type of thing you don't necessarily have to go downtown dc to find decent restaurants and
there's a lot that are moderately priced also whether you're in the suburbs or go downtown so there's quite a selection in this area
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
oh i see
yeah that's nice
um-hum
wow jeez well if i'm here also there's been such a growth in housing not in the last year but before that it was just
i don't know if you've been in this area in the last few years but it's just been incredible and has it's gone crazy i mean where we are was basically a farm ten years ago and it's houses are stacked and what has happened really is that
some of the commercial
places have not caught up with the population here and so we do have a problem of the half decent restaurants when you go on a friday or saturday night you're looking for quite a long wait
and not all of them do take reservations either so you sometimes have to allot yourself enough time
you know to go out you can't figure on going out and being back in two hours you know
the other thing that's changing here is because of the age set here a lot mostly people in they're i'd say late twenties to early forties in these neighborhoods that
we haven't done it because i don't think it will work well with us having two boys but some of the more expensive restaurants now i understand are catering
to children and making half price menus for them whereas before they would be totally discouraged from bringing children in
and they're doing this basically because they're so many working parents in this area and that they were losing the business because once all these younger people were having children they weren't going to the restaurants
um-hum
okay i'm a walker also um-hum
right
oh boy
about three okay
um-hum
oh okay
oh yeah okay
yeah
oh boy uh-huh
oh is that right
and for me i've found that as long as i try to take almost everyday at least say a twenty minute walk or a half an hour walk maybe more if i can that it's really makes a difference in my weight control
in the winter months well here you know i'm sure down there the winter's a little better than here but in the winter months january and february are
you know you really start to feel it as far as your clothes how you feel and i was doing
once in awhile floor aerobics i developed arthritis and i had to give up the floor aerobics for a while but walking is something that i continued to do
and i don't know i find for me that it's just something that i never have gotten tired of whereas when i take an aerobics class by the end of the twelve weeks i'm glad to finish it
i you know i found that it's not really necessary to knock yourself out to that degree to keep fit and i really think walking is probably one of the best things because it's something if you live into your nineties you could continue to do
i see
right
oh i see
yeah
right
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
twenty minutes to half an hour i must have walked about five minutes a day and
and then
when i well then i had two kids and you know that makes it a little harder sometimes and then i was working and then when i found when i when i got the arthritis one of the bad things about it that comes with it is fatigue and
and i found that i was tiring very quickly and i couldn't walk like a used to but i saw a big difference in my figure you know and i'm just i'm doing better because i'm under control using medications so i'm getting back into
this walking everyday but it's really true once you haven't done it for a while it's very difficult to start back again but once you really are into it i was definitely addicted to walking i had to have my walk everyday
um-hum
yeah no i yeah that's true i fortunate enough that he doesn't travel that much and that whenever as soon as he gets home from work or whatever i'll say after dinner well you know i'm talking off for my walk you know
but right now i'm taking water aerobics also and that's a little bit different it's more strenuous then i figured it would be
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i agree i agree there's something about being in the water and exercising and you come out and you have a big appetite
okay you too and have a good summer then down there okay uh-huh bye-bye
yeah
you bring your bags back you know they the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them in the one of the receptacles there but i didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that hm
um-hum
interesting
right
right
yeah i think they already do that out east they have to it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that but i think that's the way we need to go it's pretty bad all these years we've been
especially in this country all the
the plastic and the paper and everything we just used to throw out
um-hum
yeah about six months ago i started and yeah and so what i do is
it's not bad you just have to have a place to keep everything but it you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it
just put your paper in the same place every day and it'll start stacking up take your glass you know pickle jars or whatever liquid jars you know and just
rinse them out a little bit and put them all in a place and plastics
throw the lids and everything out but put all the glass in one place and plastics like milk jugs orange juice jugs things like that
yes those also and then of course cans coke cans whatever
but i haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they're taking all that i've just read a lot about it and i'm keeping these big piles of it right now to try to dump it out this weekend in fact
um-hum
and i said hey i understand y'all are taking these bags back you know what do you do with them and they had told me that when they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest and i said what do you mean the ones that don't belong there
yeah and it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number like bags from drug emporium have a
well i thought it was interesting that they gave us a scale i have to kind of think about that as to exactly where i stand i'm more against gun control than pro i think probably
um-hum
agreed
the military type things
no i come from a family of hunters and lots of brothers i have five brothers and they've all hunted and
my in fact i didn't ever hardly ever even eat beef until i was about five or six years old as
my daddy's theory was if you hunt it you better eat it until it's gone and then you go to the grocery store and buy what you need and so we always ate venison and it's still just about my favorite meat
and my husband has bow hunted through the years as well as hunt with a gun but pretty much now our theory is
you know we'll shoot with a camera unless we need to we you know we both know how to hunt and take care of meat if that occasion should ever arise for our family and we own guns we really have not
in a safe situation because you have to assume in my mind that anyplace that's out far enough where you could shoot
somebody else can be out there plinking at you and your kids you know i've never allowed my boys to have bb guns which by the time my brothers were my sons' ages
you know they had plenty of bb guns and used them and everything on you know and it was kind of that you know same kind of theory then you know that if you shot it you better figure out a way to bring it home and eat it or better not ever let mother know that
you know that you were out you know indiscriminately taking out birds or squirrels or whatever
but on the other hand we've eaten a lot of raccoon and possum and turtle all kinds of
all my i have a little grandmother in oklahoma and you know that's she'll cook anything if you bring it in and you know that's and so my brothers would always hunt those things and
you know we're a little more but on the other hand i don't have a whole lot of patience with people who don't want to talk about that kind of the end of animals and yet they're more than willing to go up to skaggs or you know
kroger or whatever and buy their chicken and their meat and come home and cook it and you start talking about hunting and they just cringe and
you know ooh you know i don't go for that you know i that to me is the other end of the coin that's hiding your head in the sand
you know i have a respect for life and for meat i eat it sparingly but when i eat it i know that you know something had to die for it so even if it was in a butcher lot
um-hum hum
yeah
that's right
how do they get access to that kind of thing you know where
or a little child i mean think of the times we've seen
you know a criminal element is kind of out of my realm i mean personally
you know or someone else well i guess i have in a couple of cases of suicide but still that's not exactly the criminal element that i think of as
you know what i am saying go down to the local 7-eleven and
and i understand that these magazines you know and whatnot that cater to that crowd are very you know the mercenary kinds of
things i can't think of some of the names right off but i've heard them that they're just replete with advertisements for these really
militarily sophisticated types of mercenary type things is what i think of
and targets yeah
well there used to be i grew up in irving we live in plano now there used to quite a few along the trinity river bottom and whatnot that you could go to and out in euless and
area out off one fifty seven and you know those are just es extinct now not even available you know they've been built up so much around it's no longer
um-hum
and yet you know i would think that a practice shooting range the kind of people that it would generate is the last place you probably really have a problem with guns
but it's a nice thought you know
so is he there for instruction then is he there for instruction the trooper
ward off trouble
yeah
yeah
oh
that's true
well i've been very happy with you know the
the education that my boys have gotten through scouting they're and my husband they're all scouters and you know a lot of times those things are encouraged you know at
um-hum see there's scout camps and whatnot but once again you know they don't run a range you know that but that still is you know all of that i guess is secondary to
well
i would i hate to see them being put into a hair or a health facility care environment because they then feel like you know the family has abandoned them
is what i get the comments from elderly people that i know that it's happened to
because the families then seem to neglect visiting them
but if that is the case that they have to go to a care facility like that i think that care facility has to be thoroughly investigated as far as the medical
evaluation what kind of credentials do the medical people hold if they're qualified what type of recreation do they have for them their food situation
the environment that they are exposed to the majority of the time that they're there is it bright and cheery
and to put them in with people that
have the same type of lifestyle that they would feel more welcome in
in making new friends because they can relate to certain individuals because of their personalities
so i guess i would like to hear how you feel about it now ray
oh my
i see
yes he did uh-huh
um-hum
that's wonderful that's good
wow that's wonderful
sure he it didn't have any hindrances for him
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's wonderful
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i see
sure i understand that
um-hum sure
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
wow i didn't know that they were that
were you satisfied with the facility
um-hum
um-hum
right
oh
um-hum
so you established a relationship with the personnel there um-hum
okay
well then you did see some compassion from the people there
or were they just very businesslike and perhaps not of that faith
okay
okay um-hum
okay yes
i see uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
right
sure
that's right
oh yes sure
oh absolutely
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum so he
yeah so he kind of adopted you and your wife
uh-huh um-hum
um-hum
well i'm sure he looks forward to that
um-hum
um-hum
right yeah
they're abandoned by their families yeah or if they or they might not have any at all
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yes
um-hum
of course yes
um-hum
like the old indian people used to do
um-hum
well pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard
well we just bought our house last july and it's it the house is forty years old so there's an established lawn and what not flower beds things like that but they've gone a few years of neglect
so we're in the process of revitalizing the whole situation we've got
trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up get rid of a few weed problems and things like that
so
i live in dallas
okay
yeah
um-hum
i'll bet
i'll bet
right
right
yeah it's pretty high actually it's done it's in the north end of oak cliff in kessler park area
and we've got about
yeah it's a little aggravating we can't we can't put in anything too big
as far as shrubs and things like that because they've got to get a chance to find the find the cracks in the rock
but
yeah it is it's solid limestone
you just we're just happy that there's trees already there so far anything like that is
a major undertaking i guess sprinkler systems or anything start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock
but and it you know not even
consider considering a pool or anything like that that's practically has to be blasted in i guess
but and it makes it makes for a different challenge i've never well i moved to dallas about five years ago and
i never really messed with anything gardening or anything like that until now but i keep hearing all the stories of different parts of town
in fact we even we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that
and the first thing the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in
because he said i've got i've got a dozen different varieties and
that's basically what he was trying to tell us
yeah
yeah it
yeah that would in fact we put in some more roses yesterday
different a few different hybrid tea type varieties yeah
okay
yeah
yeah that's we that's what we're searching we've got we've got all the different lake editions around the house and we're kind of experimenting right now we do we've got the direct sun in front and the backyard has two
great big spruce and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall so the backyard is just complete dark all day long
and we're struggling to find something for those areas
no they're in pretty good condition
we've been we've been pretty lucky on that
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
that's true that's true
it's bermuda
yeah
okay
right
yeah
okay
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh wow
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
um-hum
okay
oh okay
sure
uh-huh
wow
that really is it would it seem like it be just the opposite when you get
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's true
that's true
um-hum yeah that's something i've been
been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year
and you know we're trying to decide what to what to put on one side of the house and things like that but there's so many things that they last for just a couple of weeks and then it then it's just a bush there from then on
it's kind of it's kind of disappointing
um-hum
yep
oh i do cross stitch and some needle point
and needle point and i also crochet
yes
what kind
what kind of hobbies do you have
oh yeah
what kind of music do you do you do you perform or do you
wow
um-hum
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
um-hum
oh uh-huh
for ham radios
um-hum
oh
yeah i've always thought that was interesting i've never know anyone or used a ham radio but i always thought that the concept was really interesting
um-hum i didn't know how far of a of a distance i guess depending on what kind of aerial that you use
yeah
oh uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
regularly
that's exciting
well actually yeah i've done some original work not very much in cross stitch
but i did do one for my husband's mother
and unfortunately she passed away the day i finished the day after i finished it
and she never saw it she never knew anything about it
it is and
it's kind of spooky the
the thing that i did i did the twenty third psalm the last verse
and it was i presume you're familiar with that
and
yeah it's in it's one picture and it is hanging on the wall and i entered it in the state fair of texas under original art work and i won fourth place with it
but i do pictures all around i've done some pictures oh i've done polar bears and sayings and i've done sunsets and quite a few wedding and baby announcements
most of them are already worked out i have worked up some but not many of them and the ones that i haven't worked out there's magazines everywhere
and there's craft books and there's several designers that once you've been with a particular craft like this you get to know the designers and
you end up having some favorites in the designers
well
well i do
well and you can easily there's parts of me sometimes there's even a little bit of blood in some of my art work from needles
well i don't feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we
sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore he actually died a few months after that and so
as at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do because he
it was either know a nursing
home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days
well the
see well we
he wanted to get into a mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list
right we wound up just choosing a another mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into
or we no actually no it was even mennonite related i'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home mostly
the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in
what do you think
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's important i'd say
okay
yeah
right so that
right and that becomes difficult then
but he was essentially too proud and too
independent so that even though his heart was
getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he
lived in
his own house as long as he could though he was living alone
had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain
and this eventually
things just went too far and he
he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home
right well that's
yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to
help decide what's the right thing
and
um-hum
yep
so i don't know florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it
oh they did
um-hum
yeah
not quite no
um-hum
uh-huh
okay
okay
yeah
okay
oh that's good let me ask you this do they require you to presort it
okay see that's something in minneapolis they're really strict on in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really
oh okay yeah
yeah
right
uh-huh
it can yeah
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
it is you know big hassle
yeah that's true i mean up here they give you one of those containers and you put everything in it
so it's like if you use a lot of stuff you it's like well you know let's say if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend
it's gonna be hard pressed to put all your recyclables in that one place you know so it's kind of a pain in the butt
but i don't know that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know have those garbage people that make how every many make twenty or thirty bucks an hour have them do a little bit of the sorting
you know and maybe come up with a better system make it a little more convenient
but i
yeah
oh you can actually rent those
okay that's interesting yeah up here the city provides them kind of like
oh okay so
so where exactly are you in terms of like sarasota are you north of sarasota or
east okay and sarasota is on the west coast
okay like south of tampa right
okay i'm
yeah that's right
okay
occasionally
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yes uh-huh sure
right
no
yeah they are i mean i do them but they're a lot of work i usually have them when i there's a special event in their lives and i make a big deal out of it for them
and i think i'm most happiest with my most familiar foods that i know are successful
you know and i have i make my own pies and pie crust and you know i can make my pies from scratch i don't need a recipe to follow and
yeah you just know from heart i had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie and she said make me one and i made her one and when i when she gave me back the plate she said i didn't share this with anybody
um-hum
my word she must have a great pie recipe then
wonderful
um-hum
yeah you that's right yeah they're meant for the that evening
um-hum
no i have not huh-uh
um-hum
oh okay
sure yeah
like apple pie in america right uh-huh
wow um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah we're catering a wedding
in august and this lady that is it at it's is at her house she's not a good housekeeper so she's got to hire this crew
of four women to come in of two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready yes and there you know she must have found some jewels because they start in the corner and work out
yeah so um-hum
um-hum
sure yeah that's nice you know to have that that's a luxury today
that's right yeah
um-hum
i have a pie crust that recipe that i that is unique that has vinegar and egg in it
have you okay
egg and sugar um-hum
i no i think it would be too hazy because the no i
i think it's four cups of flour and like a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar and you combine your dry ingredients and then you put in your liquid
it just it just makes it very pliable and very flaky and you can really treat it rough and you're still going to have a flaky pie crust
like it's not mine it was from one of the magazines probably
twenty years ago and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it and it will still be flaky and i thought wow that's quite a statement for them to make
um-hum
oh wow
detroit um-hum
oh yeah that's real close
um-hum
oh how neat
oh okay um-hum
oh yes um-hum born in detroit um-hum
and whatever else you know play it by ear go spend on whatever you spend it on and if at the end of the month
our checking account is no good then we got to sit down and decide what we're going to stop spending it on but until that happens let's not worry about it
and since then we've both been done pretty well regarding raises and stuff at our jobs and our rent has stayed relatively low
and now we haven't had that problem yet and then my we just had our first child about two months ago
and then i said well we'll see what happens then because she had to take some time off work and she probably will even quit her job now and maybe do some part time work
but we still haven't had a problem paying the rent so i don't know what the i guess i'm blessed in the sense that i have a good enough job that i don't have to worry about that
yeah i live in manhattan i work out in queens oh which is also part of new york city there's just five boroughs
yeah except for i have a rent stabilized apartment so the rent is only seven hundred and fifty dollars a month which for new york is extremely inexpensive in a very good neighborhood
yeah i agree the same i mean you know i see too many elderly people with my mother is a social worker and she works with the elderly
and you know in your i don't know how much older i'm thirty
yeah you're generation has gotten pretty lucky regarding or at least in this area regarding real estate you know they went and bought a house for fourteen thousand dollars and then they were sixty years old and retired
and sold that same house for two hundred fifty thousand dollars and
you know moved down to florida or did whatever they had to do but they had all this capital i don't know if the real estate market's gonna say the same for one thing i'm thirty i'm an attorney and i don't own a house
which i think is unusual because all the my parents' friends owned houses when we were growing up and now i grew up in suburbia as opposed to in the city but still
but someday i'd like to own a house and i i've certainly make it a point that i will put some money away
maybe a little less now while my wife isn't working so that someday we can have a house and we can that would be our capital and in addition to that i have
at work they have you know investment plans where you can avoid having to go through paying taxes but your entire
yeah
fourth you have four homes now or four okay
my just the main you know just the taxes and upkeep of a house would cost me more than i'm paying in rent now obviously i get
right yeah
yeah
i think i'd agree of a similar method of getting the news with me too it's
prior to cable you know you didn't get much news off of normal television broadcasts
just usually pretty local in nature and i like cnn because you get some world events too
which is not too common on the other format newspapers and so forth
that that's true you know you hardly ever see headline articles about the either the economics or other news events going on in either of those countries
whereas if you pick up a european paper you know it all the surrounding countries soviet union and everything has major news articles in them
yeah
i'm currently living in dallas and it won't even give it the back section you just never see you just never see anything about it
which is a shame because you go to other countries and they carry quite a bit about the us on the other hand and if you go up to
canada those people are usually pretty familiar with the politics going on and the news events in the us and
and we're pretty limited in our understanding of leaders up in canada or mexico
you just you just don't know what's going on
i'd i every once in a while i have to travel overseas and then lately i've taken the taken a little shortwave radio
around and picking up the bbc and it's sort of like a cnn too you can tune into some stations and you get some like thirty minute summaries of news events
there's not much in the way of television in some of those places
yeah
yeah
yeah you know there was a what is it called is it meech lake accord or yeah that's just something
i'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in calgary a couple of years ago and
you know picked up a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it and came and it was a big thing going on there and i came back here and nothing in the papers
and just didn't see a thing about it
so it's we've got a long ways to go i guess it's improved and like i say with cnn and the cable news even there's a
it's semireligious in some respects but what is it it's
i mean its news is not that way oh i'm trying to think of the channel the christian science monitor
it surprised me i've caught it a few times and they do some pretty good news seemingly unbiased news broadcasts
the title of the network is sort of surprising you'd think it would carry mostly religious but it doesn't seem to so i'll flip through and
some more interest type topics in other countries but it's kind of world network too
well i guess
in a lot of ways
yeah well
yeah
i guess break down of the family unit for one thing
the
astounding drug use that's going on and
pretty depressing if you start thinking about it i guess
yeah
unbelievable
yeah i don't know which came first i don't know i think the drugs had a lot to do with it but
i don't know if that's a cause or an effect
yeah
however on the brighter side cars seems to be
performing a whole lot better
yeah
the
why the computers in the engines
yeah it does i mean
but i do have a lot a lot help with those you know the curves giving a lot of information diagnostic
sounds like my wife's car i just got
cadillac a used one eighty six and
the air conditioning panel i think and it reads out codes that way
and then of course have to decipher them
with the little book i use
street gangs and all that kind of stuff just
i think it comes back to the you know that the
family isn't
fulfilling the role it used to
well
they get so much information from the
tv you know
and
makes
i think part of the
parents
you know party and so forth and stands in the fact that they were
you know able to
teach them and tell them about things that and now the kids probably know more than the parents in a lot of cases
yeah
right that's true
well i i'd have to say my favorite team would be cincinnati bengals
um-hum
oh that was sad wasn't it
yeah that was just a couple of years ago
yeah well it's kind of hard to know what to do with some of these teams and they're either extremely strong or very weak and nothing much in between
oh you like the raiders
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh well that and that's the important thing i mean whether they win or lose why the fun is in the supporting them
and staying with it and hoping that you know the next time is a better time around
well
oh i love football
oh watch it every game that's on i watch
no there
well let's see i never use thought about football too much yet
yeah right
yeah that's the world league
yeah what time is that supposed to be
oh are they
oh
hum well
i haven't for some reason have never really gotten enthused about football in the summer from the world league
yeah and it just seems like it should only be done in cold weather
rather than just be played at anytime during the year
um-hum
huh
ooh
uh-huh
oh is that right
yeah
is that right
huh
i would think that if you were real cold and you hit the ground that it would seem to hurt more
oh yeah
um-hum
yeah right
what kind of weather you having right now
oh my well our weather's suddenly turned cold again our weather is so unstable
you never know
yes and this morning why it was raining and it was quite cold and then it seemed to warm up somewhat and then before i got out of church it cooled off again
so much so that i stopped at home to change coats because i had to go down to the hospital and the coat i had on was just too light in weight
yes very strong winds
well been awfully nice talking with you
yeah right most people seem to be there out there
okay well good talking to you
uh-huh bye-bye
all right we need to discuss the voters
on a national and a local level why do you think the apathy exists i blame it to apathy
why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter
oh i think so too and i think the other thing is the news media puts such a blitz on it that they've they had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know
and i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference
due to the overabundance of news we have available to us
what do you think on the local elections though
oh i think so too absolutely i think another thing
and i'm making a judgment here that may or may i think it is totally wrong well
i think that the people that are have a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education
and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would
and i believe in this but
i had an interesting comment one time a thought that would never have crossed my mind i had someone tell me that
i will never register to vote because i don't serve on a jury
so they were if they don't vote they don't have to be on a jury
there is convoluted logic for you
yes
oh i just right there are so many other ways but that one just it defeated me i didn't have any answer for that one that one was just beyond my imagination
that's a good point you're probably right
which
and that was what i was thinking exactly about because in the soviet union they had an election and they had what like a ninety eight percent turnout
a massive turnout at last someone wants us to vote they were standing in lines to vote
or any one shows up
total indifference you know what difference does it make back gone the full circle
oh certainly there's a message there even if they lose
oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too
yeah i well i know it's true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly we're going to make a statement here
you know
oh okay
ginger rogers did everything fred
astaire did and she did it backwards in high heels
i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure i did
well and some of the issues are so emotional
you know some of the really the really emotional ones have you followed the dallas elections on zoning
i
everyone has made so many statements i don't live in dallas county
but
i've heard so many statements that i've lost track
i honestly at this point
it's just too blown out of proportion for everyone you really even the news you cannot follow
what the actual facts are at this point i don't i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided
i wonder about them at some point
that's correct
and that's and that's another interesting question should judges be elected or appointed
are they politicians
sure
or you want to take the other side of it you can argue that's one of those you can pick either side and we could spend a lot of time on it because
it's difficult
it's situational really
oh
hum
well this is true this is true i was worrying along the lines of you get everytime someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box
a dollar bill comes out the bottom
that might work in some places
well ah typical lawn stuff saint augustine ah with a little bermuda mixed in some of the sunny areas
and really all i do to it is in fact i didn't even fertilize it this year i just mowed it and i mow it you know with a mulch mower so the particles fall down yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah i wouldn't don't blame you i wouldn't wanna look at them
uh-huh
yeah
yeah you think that's what it was okay well
yeah
yeah those kind of brown what we call june bugs and some people call them may beetles and yeah
oh yeah
yeah well i had some of that problem but mine was freeze it
yeah and i'm still i'm still replacing that in the back especially under the trees you know kind of slow and as you say very expensive
i caught wolfe with ah one ah one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents and i bought about twenty of them and
well i put that you know that was laid that was like
yeah that was like september i think and i had to water it you know gosh
yeah they're pretty tough
pittosporum is kind of borderline here and usually it'll do pretty well but you know every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals and it zaps it
oh wax leaf wax leaf ligustrum is the same way
yeah
oh yeah oh gee
yeah kind of cuts your possibilities for flower beds down
i had a i had a small vegetable garden that it did pretty well it's like on the side the apron of the of the parkway out behind the garage and there's our garages come in from the back you know from the alley
and it's that little piece of land over there well i had tomatoes and peppers
and i had okra and by the fence i had cucumbers
which didn't do real well they kind of came out looking like gourds
yeah but i had squash i had zucchini and yellow crook neck squash
okay
okay
i really don't know exactly where i stand just to be honest i have mixed feelings about it and i've thought about both positions i would like to have the freedom
to own a firearm i am currently married and that makes me feel more secure but if i were single i would definitely want to have a firearm
of course i think it should be locked up you know so that children can not
get
their hands on it
um-hum definitely
yeah
right now i've heard a lot of people say that wouldn't do any good but i really think that it makes a lot of sense
uh-huh
what do you mean the criminal records are a mess
by the push of a button
uh-huh
hm
are they the only state
gosh
so what has to take place them to make this happen to other states
that makes a lot of sense
right
uh-huh
um-hum so you're from new hampshire
i'm not even i hate to admit that familiar with what the laws are here in texas regarding purchasing a firearm
i guess you heard about the
so that was a real shocker
yeah that's true
um-hum
um-hum yeah so it couldn't have been avoided by you know any type of law being
set
but
yeah this is true
yeah oh i tend to agree with you in that i believe that
like you're saying the majority i believe would be responsible with the weapon and lord knows with the crime rate the way it is
we need to have something to protect ourselves
uh-huh
yeah i know how to use it
oh yeah oh sure
uh-huh
yeah it would be the people that you know could
get in touch with the underground or something and i mean they have ways
yeah
yeah you're right that's what i was thinking
it is it's very complex
um-hum
yeah
yeah do you do a lot of hunting
with your guns
are you
so do
no i never keep a budget my budget or philosophy i guess is spend as little as possible
and it's sort of always worked
but that depends on you know on the individual if they can
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
yes
well yeah i couldn't probably be bothered doing that
every month and every since well we've been married almost thirty years now but my husband got paid once a month
no because if you charge things and you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isn't anything left to spend anyway
um-hum
well yeah we tried to
or we are paying them off now or there was a time when maybe we didn't pay all of them off but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is
it works for me but i can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people
yeah
um-hum yeah
um-hum it is when you do it that way
well we eat out a good deal at this point i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldn't you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks
ah in nineteen eighty so i started working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved for three years but the what minuscule amount i made but that way you just didn't put it on your credit card and it was paid for
yes and so i think that that's difficult for most people but then my father was very scotch and you know you never could afford anything although he could afford everything if he wanted to
yes
and i never worried about saving money because we just we're in the savings plan at work and they took it out so
i
um-hum
well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that
and we didn't buy really new or expensive cars i think the most my we're looking at cars now we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars
and they were mainly used cars
yeah so you know we've been rather frugal in that
in that respect yeah
okay
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
like a warehouse almost
um-hum
um-hum
well the unfortunate truth is that
no matter what sort of a program or whatever that gets put out there and made available by the taxpayers' money
there is going to be someone who will abuse it they will find a way people are very creative especially those that are on the public dole and want to be there
they can be very creative in their in their abuses and not surprisingly some of the worst offenders are the people who are inside the system
and are in a position to know exactly where the red flags would be what they can get away with
i happen to work for an assemblyman at one time and i saw abuse of power there really subtle
but it was still there okay the man
was not a millionaire however he could have never gone to work again and lived comfortably
and he owned a lot of low income housing for which he got considerable government aid
refurbish it and
oh sure
and oh doing a public service and like i say you're right in that we're paying an awful lot well not really comparatively to
other countries especially european countries they pay a larger percentage than we do but the things that they get in return are more tangible
to the common person national health care education systems that you know that's one of mine own pet peeves is how can how can our teachers be so damn efficient
right
oh yeah it was ross perot was speaking in front of the national press club and he was talking about how people in the government say well you know we've got a hundred and eighty billion dollars in fraud and mismanagement okay
a hundred eighty billion dollars a year just sort of going out of window and why don't they do anything to stop it well it'd cost a billion dollars to track all the fraud and mismanagement well guess what i think that's a really good return on investment don't you
a billion versus a hundred and eighty billion
well i think i don't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes
and the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax
so if you're renting a house or doing anything else you're not
actually contributing to the education of your children
and i think that's wrong i think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent
then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system
so
as it turns out we don't really have a
tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it
um-hum
yeah
yeah
no
yeah you would be
oh
yeah
gee
yeah
yeah
ah
oh well that's pretty good
oh yeah
gee whiz
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
no huh-uh
well they say that texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation that our high school graduates can't even match the national average
so you know our school system down here is
no where near perfect but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it
yeah
oh yeah
yep
yeah
yeah they need to take things at their own speed
yeah
um-hum
yeah i think it'd be a lot better
you know each child has to learn at his own rate they can't keep force feeding things to each other and
or you know at the kids
um-hum because he can't do it
yeah
and it's not that he can't do it he just can't do it quite as fast or
yeah
all right
yeah
um-hum
all right
huh all right
jumped on out there
that's good
yeah i did too up until ninth or tenth grade
yeah
yeah and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course i had a electronics course i could take but we lived out in the country and we didn't have all that
fancy stuff to worry about you know we had our auto shop out there and our shop and
you know we had just about every thing that we needed but they don't have it anymore
there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore
our oldest boy goes to lubbock high down here and they go to school four and half days a week
so
that's pretty weird
hum
gee
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
i can imagine
yeah
yeah that would be quite a shock
um-hum
oh like four h then
all right
all right
yeah just something you do everyday
yeah just something i have to do everyday
that's good our oldest boy went into
school politics and made vice
that's interesting i hadn't seen that i know there was a lot of talk about freon contributing to the
the hole in the ozone layer and other various pollution but other than
making the air conditioning systems tighter i didn't know that there was any work on alternate coolants
um-hum
the times that i've seen any sort of loss is
at a time when maybe i'd have the freon checked in the air conditioner or maybe topped off
and it seemed to me that they'd practically waste almost as much as they'd put in the car but i've noticed in the past few years that the controls on that are
tighter people are a lot more concerned about that
well obviously cars and trucks contribute quite a bit
and personally i'll i carpool most of the time with someone i work with but my schedule doesn't
doesn't make for a consistent carpool
um-hum
that's a that's a good question the leaded fuels have obviously been out of the automotive industry for quite some time and there's always talk about
the large auto makers in this country spend untold millions to lobby to keep business just the same as usual
there's a big issue in rhode island right now there's a company that wants to build a coal fired energy plant very close to downtown providence
and they are pulling all sorts of tricks to maneuver around various controls and inspections and regulations apparently the
the
um-hum
yes it does
yes
no other things came took priority
yes you know that's interesting because i was talking at someone in the office just this morning about the retirement and what we would like to have when we retire and how we're going to get there
it's really hard to anticipate in advance what you think you're going to need okay and then try and plan now
because things come up
you know
um-hum
oh no i hadn't even thought about that we have investments to alleviate some of the
cost of our old age hopefully in terms of an apartment complex
we've been partnership with some other people
but it's not going to provide
a whole bunch of money i mean it might pay the utilities
you know at that point in time
and hopefully our investments with ti will help our retirement years
um-hum
is that right
that's not very encouraging is it
um-hum
when you buy something like that in advance how can you be sure that well i guess you don't really buy into the nursing home do you
you buy
it's a policy that will pay for your nursing home should you need it
hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh i think that's very true and that brings it more to home when it happens close to home
um-hum
um-hum
and if you got that covered
don't we all right
at least
at least
well it sounds like we have some good plans anyway
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum and that will always happen
well unfortunately very little much less than what i need to
i think the most exercise i've gotten in the last three or four month is just jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions it keeps me pretty busy but
it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going and
you know really exercise is so important and i realize that
when you exercise what do you do you do it at home or a club or
i got a hold of richard simmons's tape
what is it i can't even think of the name of it right offhand
with the oldies
sweating with the to the oldies yeah and that's not bad
that's pretty upbeat so you know i every once in a while i'll put the cassette in and go with it but
not often enough to have a routine
but
i don't know by the time i get home all i wanna do is just collapse or sit down at my computer and my fingers exercise more than anything now
yes
do you ever ride a bike or anything like that
here about the
the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk them
because they're enclosed and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter
and it's safe
i know a doctor once told me it a friend of mine suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is
the swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with
and the water takes the resistance
right and you don't get the soreness
i've done some water exercises
but our pool is not is not heated so it's
summertime only
you don't go out when it's
twenty some odd degrees and go out to the swimming pool
so what part of mississippi are you from
whereabouts is that
oh and you do have cold weather down there
ours started thanksgiving
and from there just well today was pretty
but
oh sunday the snow and ice came in
and there was no
oh
uh-huh
well i think the public school systems are doing a good job i think they have a long way to go yet but i think that
they are starting to head towards more technology
and getting the kids computer literate earlier you know my kindergartners were on the were on the computers and i think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done
and i think that the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them you know
skills you know you don't just add one plus one you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together and i think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think they literally cannot come in out of the rain
you know and that just i don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted
and this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education
so i think you know they're trying to head into teaching them to think and use the education that they have and i think that's very important
oh yeah
oh yeah i tutor a girl that's in eighth grade and her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my algebra two when i was in high school and it's like oh i going to take this home and study it before i can help you
and that's you know a lot of the things that we did in school i've never used and never will use
and so i think that it's appropriate to teach them you know why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this
yes that's a
you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say
and it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it
and you waste so much time
quote unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be you know that
i think it's i think it's crazy personally you know the whole first nine weeks of school is used
as a review but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in october so that you know your school district shines throughout the united states
and i think that's totally useless i think you know there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons but i think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous it's like bragging on your grandchildren
you know and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to those and that's great but that's what they're doing with the school systems and they're wasting too much time on that i think
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
yeah there's not yeah the bottom line is always money
do you have any children
oh
yes i enjoy it a lot
oh
do they go to a day care center or do they stay at
oh that's nice
i think so i think it's hard to find a good day care i have worked in at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion but this one that i'm in now is
like in pennsylvania for babies that's what i work with there has to be a one to four ratio at the most
no more than four babies per care giver but we keep it down to like two to one
yeah that makes a little easier to deal with
oh i know we
what we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are low to the ground and they're reinforced real strong and they'll sit four babies we would just lie them in there and they roll real well and maneuver
no
right
yeah that's certainly something we hope never happens
most really care in this center really care most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education
and really there's only like eight children per room and there's like two or three mostly three care givers in each room and that enables them to spend more time with the children
sometimes i feel like all i'm doing is changing diapers giving bottles and putting babies down for a nap so it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them
it's easy get attached to them too
in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months
and throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve
so i have the real young ones in my room
um-hum
they're yeah they're wonderful they don't complain too much
yes they are a lot of fun
not quite it's a they start to crawl they try to climb up on things and
you have to be real careful all the everything is baby proof you know all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything but they try
in my area because we i live in a college town in penn state university so i there's a lot of
a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what's going on and
in general though i've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers i've worked at
yes
um-hum
that is sad
what
oh my god
oh my god
oh that poor child
that's awful
i think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the middle east
i agree
absolutely
i think that's great i'm glad to see that but i again i don't want to see
us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the soviet union without
a well not a whole lot under any circumstances because i don't know i'm a i'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them and so i'm not
much in favor of it but i'm glad to see us advising them that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money so
but i'm ready to have a president elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda even if it doesn't work
at least he is somebody who is working on that problem and i haven't seen that in the last eleven years so
they don't seem to have a clue
oh i agree i just i think we got once we started economic aid over seas we have really
set ourselves up to be
yeah
that's another thing i don't understand is things like selling technology and even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt
that doesn't to me that just doesn't make any sense as much in debt as we are
i just i don't know i think it's definitely time for a change but i don't see anybody i don't understand too why we have to have democrats and republicans and it's either one way or the other there's
it seems to be we're turning into a black and white society you either do it this way or you do it that way and there's no in between
and that just it obviously isn't working
oh yeah
oh i agree with you well of course you know we have the national embarrassment in our state jessie helms
and as soon as we can get of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he just lines up people against him so
it's not too it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions he's usually on the ninety eight to two side he's the one of the two that votes
yeah he's
very ineffective i think
right
oh unfortunately nineteen ninety
yeah we're stuck with him for a
a little while longer but unfortunately for him but maybe fortunately for us his health is not great so
i hate
well actually oh the last eight or ten years i have
an aunt and i should say have like done our family reunion
and oh you know we send out letters to everybody and we rent a place in this savings and loan in a in a little town
and then everybody brings a covered dish and that sort of thing and
it's real nice because my mother
had seven brothers and sisters and if we didn't do this like the cousins would never see each other the aunts and uncles that's the type family reunion we've had there you know
so
oh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
yeah well it really in your case and mine too i guess in most everybody's as far as especially more distant relatives you know cousins aunts and uncles and so on
you just wouldn't see them if you didn't do something like that
well my immediate family like on my side has gotten large because there's four of us and now we've all had children and now we all have grandchildren
so that makes just my immediate family like thirty people so we do a separate reunion and we have a lake house about seventy miles from here
so we we've done it once we all get together down there
and that works out real well because there's a lot
well lot of things everybody can do they can fish or they can you know swim or things like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
well it really doesn't much matter where or how you do it as long as you manage to do it every how often did like your families up there have them
yeah
yeah we have taken like old home movies from you know twenty five thirty years ago and shown them at the family reunion
uh-huh we finally put ours on tape a few years ago there's places now that do that
and it really is nice when you when because you can get on one tape you can get about thirty or forty old reels you know
on there and it and then you can skip around and find what you want and all that it really has worked out good
so
so how did you get on the ti thing
well about the only thing i know is one of my friends at work has one little boy and she's about to have a second baby and i hear some of her
tales about trying to get child care now she doesn't like to use some of the places like kinder care la petite academy she likes to just find individuals you know who take children into their home
and you know sometimes they have found somebody by word of mouth other times she has to go through the newspaper and see what she can find
there are some like oh chamber of commerce you can kind of call there are some places like that will give you some referrals at least
but she just kind of goes and meets people that she sees advertise and interviews with them and ask them their
ways
oh
ah
yeah there's been a few people that have kind of used the same person kind of like word of mouth one person in the department had them and
then you know other people had followed and had the same one as their child grows like some people only want little infants you know and when they get to two years old
they don't want you know a whole lot of two years old because they're a little more active so they you know a lot people in the department seem to have used like the same couple of woman as their children grow but
i really keep thinking that t i ought to come up with something like through texins to have you know some kind of facilities there at work because it really is a lot of extra pressure on our working parents
no i think it should be done through texans i mean i understand that
but you know i think that they could work out something with texans something that would be close to work
because i think that would help ease things too if you've got your child somewhere close because i see these people you know dashing out the door
and you know texins is not well i don't think it's
really directly supported by ti i think it has it's own kind of funding but something like that you know you would have to be a ti or a texins kind of does it
well how would i do that
well again i know from the person who you know is a friend ever mine at work
she and i i've talked to her after she's interviewed some people just really sound i mean bizarre i mean you can't imagine that these people are putting in for you know minding others' children like if you could go to the house and
kind of go okay
others if they have some way of handling like i kind of wonder about these women who take in children there are times that you're going to have to do you know for the women they're going to have to do some personal things themselves i mean
every single day they may have you know every once in a while they may have some kind of personal doctor appointment or got to get the car fixed or something like that how do they do that
so you ask them do you have a fall back you know for those times are you going to put me in a bind or do you have somebody else who can take care of the kids or do those things for you on the times that you need to you know have personal time off and do those items
and ask them you know who else have they you know baby sat for in the past and can you talk to them look at the facilities and ask them what kind of things they do to you know during the day with the child that kind of thing i guess
uh-huh
hm
hm
uh-huh
hm oh do you know one time i we just got married a couple of years ago and there was people that were coming you know into town with children
and i wanted you know babysitters for the service and available to them if they didn't want to bring their children or you know get away and stuff and i just called in the from the yellow pages you know babysitter outfits that are
again must have some kind of licensing or whatnot and just had them i mean
what i did was i had a babysitter during the service you know and anybody who had children could just you know take the child to the nursery and i had somebody there everybody i knew was going to be at the wedding so i knew i had to find somebody i didn't know to do that
and it worked out okay i didn't know that there were services that you just called the yellow pages and there's a babysitters are us or something and you say please i need one you know oh yeah no problem we'll send you out one
i
thought i checked into it one time just pre planning
and it can run like a hundred dollars a week i think my friend who now has a two and a half year old she spends about fifty to sixty dollars per week for him so i think it's anywhere from like fifty to a hundred depending on the place you take
yeah it gets to be kind of expensive and i think you know some of the woman do weigh that
and one attorney each have very young children and now they are part timing it is kind of like a test to see how this will work to have these people work part time
depending on the responsibilities that we're giving them and to see how that will workout because they all want to you know still have a little income to help out financially but they want to spend time with their children so they're part timers
and it for the one that's working with me it's working very well i don't have any problem with that i have one that's helping me out at for the litigation we're doing
and she's there three days a week and this that seems to be fine i can handle that very well with her being there only half time
next week
oh
yeah well it's whatever they feel comfortable with you know basically whatever they feel best and there's probably some women who
may not do their child any good being there all the time because you know they can't quite see themselves you know dedicated that much
and maybe again you know their you know their ideas change once the baby is there they go oh well you know now i like this a lot more than i thought i would
but cathlene the part timer she says you know she just doesn't she she's always one of these workaholic kind of people and she just really can't sit still enough
to just be home with the baby she has to have you know something else she's always been one who's put in
you know like the fifty to sixty hour work week and after she had the baby she was coming back in to check her office and to check her in box you know like ten days later she was back in and we were like cathlene you got two months off you know you don't have to be back in there she's just
always back in there and she's a she just finds it very hard to you know tone that down even though she's a part timer she still will put in time on saturday
yeah i have what about yourself
yeah i should because i've been waiting for a few minutes to talk interesting interestingly enough
i had the same topic yesterday when i called so i've got my spiel down
uh-huh twice in a row second time it's happened to me but
let's see last week my wife and i went to see
kindergarten cop
yeah that was it was it was pretty cool
yeah
right
oh they went another time though
wow
yeah well fortunately we have a dollar movie here so i
oh i hope doesn't i think they're hedging to but i don't want them anyway it was worth two bucks for my wife and i to go
so
okay
goodman
okay
yeah
couple of dollars worth of laughs
yeah
right
yeah
the king huh okay
okay
all right
yeah
yeah
yeah
well my wife has a problem with
she can't suspend her disbelief of a movie like she'll sit there and say that won't happen that can't happen there's no way you know so it's kind of hard for me to pick like a
like if we would go see a von dame movie and he runs around the screen for an hour and half just kicking teeth you know
he she'd be like no he couldn't do that you can't beat up ten guys at once with guns and
yeah so she can't even enjoy it but i think we're working on her a little bit where she just sits back and takes the movie at what it is
so we've been working a couple of friends of myself
we've been you know we'll go to like segal or we haven't went to segal yet we're going to and van damme and like stallone
like the first blood
yeah that's what the guy told me last night he's like a gangster or something
so i'd like to see that
huh
yeah
did that have that girl from cheers in it
okay
yeah
oh okay this was a comedy so it probably wouldn't be the same one
with old shirley maclaine oh yeah i don't know the name of it either
have you seen awakenings with robin williams
i would suggest that it's
yes i have
well i'm leaning toward medical professions myself so it had some
yeah psychiatric clinical setting so it was interesting
to say the least from that standpoint because it is a true story
and
yeah so
was it deniro
yeah that he just did an incredible job of acting
rain man
yeah now that see if you liked that you would
okay if you liked that you'd probably
yeah you would enjoy awakenings is as touching
but it doesn't have the language and other things that might detract from the movie
it's really it's a movie that wouldn't mind taking my kids to
and i mean it's really clean and but it's it doesn't lose any quality i mean
i think sometimes movies try to spice it up a little bit with things unnecessary language or nudity or whatever
but this one here is awakenings is very clean that was the only thing i didn't like about
it sure it makes it true to life and everything but you know about rain man it was language is harsh every now and then
but yeah it was cool i'd probably seen it three or four times
oh yeah
yeah true grit rooster cogburn
yeah
yeah that tv show or
kelly's heroes yeah
yeah
uh-huh
really
do you remember much about that movie
yeah
uh-huh
okay things you like to do with your kids right
i bet i do and i don't know and you're from texas and you know what it is snowing we have a three inches of snow on the ground
it's so cold oh is it cold like what sixties
oh jeez it is supposed to be eighteen degrees tonight i was thinking about you all the way home from our class just got home from our computer class hey i mean what are the chances of this happening
how many people do you think
i think oh that is just too funny oh isn't that great that's just wonderful well i wrote you a little letter on the latest update so
oh you have to in fact when nicole was having her problems with not starting you know we prayed a lot and we prayed as a family on
the way to the tournament and what night did we i guess on the way to the sela game last thursday which they're kind of our big rivals and we prayed that she would get to start and that she would play well and she did she played the best i've seen her play
and as consistent as i've seen her play and but we prayed as a family we i made all the kids go because you know all they boys sometimes don't like to go and it was just great and her little friend was there and
basketball
golf
yep
is dave is dave playing racquetball
oh that's great how's barry doing with his weight is he working out
yeah he's gonna be a while getting settled you know getting things going
oh bless his heart this lady over dwa she's so bad keep your keep your keep your ears and eyes open
it's a great stepping stone it's a great stepping stone
oh i got a one hundred percent on my test
my test for my class my computer class that dan and i are going to we got them back this is from last week so we're i'm pretty jazzed because i got a eighty two on the first one and dan got a ninety two
yeah and tonight we learn spreadsheets
and last week we last three weeks we've been doing data base
oh it's pretty darn neat
oh
yeah
oh yeah well we're just really basic stuff you know and our teacher his wife is the one of the teaching leaders the bible study fellowship
yeah and i and i've had her been and i thought i recognized the name oh he's just the most wonderful man and we weren't even in his class to start with and then
it just i mean the way god works you know we ended up in his class and we just couldn't be happier i mean he's this marvelous teacher
yeah oh and library went well today yes harold reynolds who's a mariner baseball player came to school today and they had lunch in the library of all things
got to come in because mommy was the librarian you know so he got lots of autographs so that was pretty cool so they had a good time
so how serious is the subject of crime in your area
jeez
well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here san jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime
but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the outlying agricultural towns
because you end up having a lot of gangs forming largely around the hispanic core
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh well that's efficient
they're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort
wow
uh-huh
yeah there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays
uh-huh
end results of poverty and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else because i mean you know the parents aren't making a living at anything
and they're accidental parents half the time anyway
it's illegal but it's not wrong because all their friends do it
yeah
well i think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of an actual solution to the problem
the social the other social problems wouldn't go away
i mean there's been a lot of
and i used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus but then the more i thought about it the more sense it made is that alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else
and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow
yes it is do you have young people
yes
three small ones okay would you feel like those youngsters could be raised with a balanced life understanding all of the aspects of their lives if they did not perform some kind of public service
um-hum
um-hum
well you're looking at it from a perspective of something equivalent to the draft where you take two years out of your life and
and serve as a in the military however they didn't say that it would be required to be two consecutive years what about the option
of requiring these young people to have two years of public service in association perhaps with their education and that they get you know how we have life credits in college
experience credits why could those not apply in exactly that way you actually are using that as a part of your college education and it's a quote public service course
uh-hum
well it would be like an elective
you know on a on a some sort of a social agency where you do volunteer work or perhaps you'd like to do reading for the blind for a couple of years in your spare time
and it might be three hours a week that's what a class is
three or four hours a week then they have a balanced view i think of
what is out there i know that a lot of young people are raised in a very protected environment mom and dad don't want them exposed to the kinds of things that
they had to endure or they had to go through they want a better life for their kids and they do put them in this wonderful little cocoon and then when they get out in the real world and life does give them a good smack they go to their knees
because they haven't had the experience in helping people therefore they don't have experience in seeking help or in
being helped gracefully i myself have done a lot of volunteer work but i am very apprehensive about accepting help
i'm very independent and i don't care much for that and i raised my children to be very independent
and yet they did their share of volunteer work we went to the nursing homes and carried christmas gifts and we visited sick people those are all good community service behaviors and activities and they don't require a big bite of your life
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
defense
uh-huh
right
right but you did serve
in a different respect and that's what i'm saying you don't have to go into the peace corps in order to be of service to the community
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah i do a great deal of you know i would rather expend the personal energy than just shell out a few bucks and let my conscience rest i feel like that you
i mean you know you don't really get involved and you don't really comprehend what you're accomplishing
and i think that's important and that's the reason that i think that there should be some provision even if it's not mandatory
at least provide the avenue through which young people can do volunteer work even if it is not a two year stint in the peace corps
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum yeah
the area where they match very well
but it might be of interest to put in some sort of a formal system like they do the screening system in the military service okay you know what are your interests and what are your aptitudes let's see if we can match you to a job that you prefer
particularly with you have the education to deal with it
i don't know that may or may not be a useful choice but i do know that there are a great deal of young people out there who would say why do i want to go
you know out and get mosquito bit and sleep on a hard ground when i can sit here in this cushy bed and not go out and i can have my music and drive my cars and have fun through the summer
and there are a lot of them who just do not have that sense of consciousness and i think maybe something in place might build that
really when was the last time you went
well i haven't been in probably about three years and the last time we went was in well i guess it was it was like hunting season and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake sam rayburn
which is in east texas
it is real pretty let's see do you do a lot of fishing and
one of the ones that you pull along and then pop is it pop up
pop up
yeah what do you have
a tent
really
so you're a serious camper
well that makes sense
but when y'all went camping is that what you normally i mean what did you normally do
i guess probably just where ever you live at then has a lot to do with where what you're gonna do when you go and you do actually camp
did you ever like travel around to what's that the little ko koa camps whenever you ever done that
yeah
hum
they actually travel from what city to city state to state
that's probably where i first started was in girl scouts
well let's see i just i mean i just like to go and normally i go with a whole group of friends and we just kind of go and hang out and
just do fun stuff roast marshmallows
yeah or take a deck of cards if we if we can actually see and play cards and stuff
yeah it's relaxing
plus you kind of makes you appreciate some lot of the things you take for granted
i guess a lot of times when i first turn the tv on i normally go to those because i pay for them i'm like i guess i want to see if there's anything i really want to see there so i don't end up watching the
prime time on some of the standard channels as much i tend to go to my premium channels first
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
the only night we tend to watch some of that is on sunday nights starting fairly late like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe till midnight they have some british comedy
that we've really liked a there's a variety some of them is black adder or good neighbors or yes prime minister and are you being served they rotate those around
yeah
yeah right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i'm not into watching sports now my husband likes to watch football
yeah
hm
um-hum
oh
well we really like the mexican food you know here in texas and so we try and go around to different mexican restaurants trying them out
and so tia's is probably our favorite restaurant there and i think they have the one of the best services that we really like it
no where's that at
uh-huh
um-hum
oh
a lot of the big name brand i guess chains yeah but oh we've tried places you know down by the collin creek mall the you know alvarez and gosh we tried what was across the street
el paso's el chico's or something yeah something like that uh-huh yeah
yeah
oh yes
oh
uh-huh oh i know i tell i tell you what they are they just they're excellent food i wish i could make them here at home
yes i have eaten there now the only problem i love the food it's a lot of cajun food and a good seafood but the service has always been so strange every time i've been in there mostly it's been at lunch time
and but i hear at night though they have you know the outdoor bar and that's it's really you know kind of lively so it's really good all their blackened grilled stuff
uh-huh
oh well that sounds great
um-hum
huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i know i
yeah
oh me too me too so i know i know that i you know i just work and i'm just tired when i get home and i just don't feel like cooking
and you know on the weekends there's always things to do and so we like to go out to lunch on saturdays especially
uh-huh
yeah now i we've been there twice and both times i just oh the food just didn't quite settle with me and i don't know what it was
um-hum
yes and i love
um-hum
um-hum yeah
now i haven't been there before i went to one i think in ohio or somewhere up there but i've never been to that one here i know it's just down the street so now have you been to applebee's
yes i really like that too so that was
oh i've been i've been there twice uh-huh yeah so
salad bar yeah
not really i don't really read any regularly in the past i use to read some i use to read time all the time
but i guess that was just it i don't know too much reading to do so i stopped doing it so
yeah i do a lot of reading for work because i don't know i just have a lot of research literature to keep up on is the thing so
yeah i'm in computer science
uh-huh
right it's just the thing is i don't know i just have a tendency to want to read everything no matter what i buy what i buy so it's kind of weird
yeah i don't know it's just a weird thing about me so i try not to buy anything that i'm afraid of reading the whole thing so
yeah
oh i don't know i like reading up on the news and sometimes i like some science stuff but not much actually so
i mean because popular science type magazines aren't usually very i don't know yeah scientific so
how about you what do you read
uh-huh
uh-huh
girl stuff huh well it's not girl stuff it you know good stuff that's
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i find it interesting to read just about anything that's lying around usually i mean it's always interesting stuff i don't i wouldn't normally buy
you always just well i don't know like i had an old friend who use to read cosmopolitan all the time and i thought it was the most ridiculous magazine but it was just so interesting to find out i don't know about the culture of people who read cosmopolitan you know
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
do you read you're an artist then so do you read a lot of art magazines at all or
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
okay
well i the biggest way it's going right now lot most of the grocery stores
have got things set up where you can bring in your plastic and your cans and newspapers and then they've just got different barrels
and
yes it's all voluntary now they do have some places where you can take
things and get cash but i think the lot of people don't really want the cash you know they just want to help recycle which is what we do you know we
probably the only thing sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in and we let the kids get the money for that but for
right
yeah that's true but that's really the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating you know but
um-hum
oh really
oh wow
yeah
so it's all about you say it is all voluntary do they
will it be mandatory
is it all is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff or is it all
okay yeah that's
right
right yeah that's true that's true
well they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers and stuff like that but
um-hum right
um-hum
well i tell you it's kind of funny now at even at ti i don't do you work for ti okay
at ti they're doing recycling i mean for a long time they didn't do this but now they're recycling cans and paper we have separate bins
you know and they i mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees and you know
it's really i can't believe that you know because they've got it all posted all over the place how much they're saving and how yeah
oh okay
um-hum
yeah
right yep so you don't think about it
right
yeah well you think about the waste even i mean you know cost wise and you know like you saving trees and stuff like that i mean it's just amazing you know the difference
i haven't seen anything but that doesn't mean that they don't i don't watch much tv but i haven't really seen anything advertised publicly
i mean like i said they do a lot of internal advertising on that kind of stuff but i haven't seen anything
see i don't see a lot of ti advertisements on tv anyway i think they advertise more other places where they're not located
you know so i don't see a lot of advertisements for ti
right
uh-huh
right well even i mean in the kid's schools i mean they do things to try and recycle and
i know my kids like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say oh look at that somebody is not saving the earth you know so i mean the kids i mean they're really trying to educate all ages you know and it's good to start the kids real young
and stuff like that because i mean when i was a kid they never did stuff like that i mean it's like nobody was concerned about it you know and it's like
you know it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things saying hey you know we're ruining the earth you know and now everybody is doing something about which is good
um-hum
um-hum
well
yeah this
i think that it really surprises me because of the cost savings i mean this is such a tremendous amount of cost savings i mean why
i can't understand why nobody saw that before i mean even not
even the aspects of not saving the earth i mean it's so cost you know
well yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
oh
oh
i see okay
is not real cost efficient oh okay oh i understand that though
uh-huh
right
and glass right um-hum
yeah that's true and even i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil
i don't know how cost efficient that would be i guess
um-hum
um-hum
wow
really i know i really i don't know i think that i mean i think that they really are doing a good thing now and i hope it keeps well i'm sure it'll keep up
you know i think it's really catching on you know i think that
i'm not sure if it i don't know i think it's a good idea to make it mandatory
right
well i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately that i think there are some occupations that they should such as the health field the transportation field
they're already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth they do it to prisoners so i
i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions and i think if
right
uh-huh
of the employee is hurting the business i mean maybe it's number one because generally if they are involved in that type of thing they they're into theft
and as an employer i would think that would be
and the first it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost there there's no way but my concern is school bus drivers
i'm not even i'm in education i'm not even opposed to it for that
i'm concerned in the medical field
right
right
right but when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or
a train and it doesn't take that long they don't have be totally roaring drunk just a little off on their timing could mean life
oh okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my word
right
well as long as you accept that it is a random
that way you can't feel like somebody's out to get me if it's almost like being selected for jury duty
you know so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel that's just the way it is
i would i would rather have it that way to know that i was chosen
at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in
because i think there's when you let other employees turn in people
right
so i would really rather know however there's got to be some backup to say that if somebody does observe you at say at a party
using drugs i would think that it would be their obligation to report that
personnel or something
right
right
well i don't know what kind of work you do but there would be even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way and
right
right
right
it's
i just think employers have to have especially given today the drug abuse that goes on i just think employers have to have some kind of way
to see that they're not being
put at
risk because they're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits the insurance claims et cetera and i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to
illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse
right
right
uh-huh
huh
to see how that's
is it is it just a small group of the employees that are concerned
they just don't want to be drug tested
you know we've never my husband and i have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested
my husband's retired from i r s agents
however this isn't a problem that we have and either alcohol or drug and so we in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal
right
and then they say well if you give them the right to do this then they're going to take some other right away from you but i a firm
come into a company as you sign a paper saying that i will go take a
well we've talked a little bit about the plano school system i really have been pleased with plano i have a child who my son is learning disabled
and i thank god every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into
he's in elementary school and he's not severely learning disabled i mean you know he just
he's being helped he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math and they recently released him from resource which i'm i was thrilled i really was i just
thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump
and he's in the herman method of reading i don't know if you're familiar with that it is something new and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters
it's wonderful
yes and it's wonderful he didn't have a problem with reading as a matter of fact he's reading on level the problem was his spelling
and you know in watching the way he has struggled it's interesting because i'm convinced i have the same learning disability or had that was ignored and
that's right and so it's you know it's not an intelligence problem it's just a problem with learning
well you know it's funny when he was in first grade he had trouble with spelling and i would say to the teacher
you know it's amazing he will be able to you'll say to him spell cat
and you know he'll say c a t and then he would go to write it and he would write c o t
and i kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here something is wrong here and the teacher kept saying oh he has a may birthday he's just immature
and because all year long they kept telling me i was crazy
well i was and i and i went up there the second week of school and i said you know something is wrong and thank god the head teacher the team leader was a special education major
it was it was and
she had picked it up yep she had already picked it up and she said you know we were going to call you if you hadn't called us we think there's a learning disability and we think he needs to be tested immediately
because you know once the first report card comes in they have all these people being tested and she said i think we can get him real fast
and sure enough they tested him and you know he qualified for the help
and it's been great and i and i thank god i'm here because i know i have a sister who has the other extreme she has a child in connecticut who is extremely gifted
and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her
and to me that's the same thing it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored this poor gifted child is being ignored
that's true
that's true
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
right
right
exactly and
they don't take them that's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
really
yeah
well when comparing test scores i know recently i was in a discussion and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools and that was one of the points that i made is that you're not comparing apples to apples
you know you can't say you know i know steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and into a private school
and which is which is too bad
but on the other hand i can't necessarily blame them you know they are a private school and they can do whatever they want
and they that's right they have the ability to be selective but you can't say then well public schools are
are not as good
perhaps they are because they're
you're right
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right well you see that with the foreigners that come here
i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they where they said that
you know these children they had to be the best and they put off all social life all everything you know well is that good yes the child is very bright
bright but on the other hand i feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road
have are more rounded you know sure i think it's real important to have friends i think it's real important to play sports i think it's real important to be part of a team
no right
uh-huh
i don't know i haven't had much spare time lately but
oh uh-huh
and
oh have you oh you sew the bodies and everything
oh uh-huh
oh
oh did you
oh uh-huh
oh my goodness
well it sounds like you're creative
oh do you sell them
oh have you oh
yeah i bet how long does it take you to make one
oh i can crochet and knit actually i started an afghan but it's been a long time ago probably over a year ago and it's kept sitting in my closet half done right now but that it's a knitting one and
oh didn't you
oh i yeah i enjoy knitting i kind of like that but i just i like i say i haven't done it for a while and i do like sewing sometimes i i've made a few of the you know just the little valence curtains in my house and
things like that but it it's just finding the time for these things that you enjoy but
oh i would love one of those oh that's neat
oh those are wonderful aren't they
oh yeah that and that's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff it it'd be nice to have that
oh that's neat well do you have i guess you're kind of young i was gonna say do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for
oh uh-huh
oh well how did you get involved in that
you just
so you did buy a pattern and then started from there huh
uh-huh have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress yeah i've i did make some clothes for one of those
oh it did oh
oh
you haven't sewn it back up huh
uh-huh do you do any kind of painting or anything
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
i tried that i did i ended up just stenciling a blind like a just a roller shade but i can i had a hard time stenciling for some reason i just couldn't do it
and people have told me it's very easy
have you
well you're right there and i just think they should have a little more restriction on who buys guns
instead of just being able to walk into a store and buy a gun they should have a waiting period
exactly
and i and as far as hunting i'm you know this is the same thing and if you are a you know a legitimate hunter or you just need a handgun or something like that a two week or three week wait period is not going to make any difference
if your criminal and you need a gun for that night it's you know it's going to make you a little bit mad
but they should you know they should have some kind of restrictions and i think everybody should have to have a permit
they don't require everybody to have a permit
and i think they should if you're going to have a gun you need to you know register it and
have a legitimate reason as to why you have it
and it i don't even think they do that in texas do they
i don't think so either
uh-huh
um-hum
that's true
i know it'd just make it would make it harder for them to get them but they still could but
but you're right they're always gonna yeah
hum-um because they're always going to be able to get them
no not really my daddy was always a hunter so we always had rifles or shotguns or things around the house but you know he was responsible with those and
there was never an accident or anything like that and we've never been robbed or mugged or anything like that
um-hum
oh my goodness
my oh my goodness
oh my goodness
oh
oh my goodness
oh how frightening
it really is
but they you know and they have when my sister when she was going to the university of texas she
-kay
oh okay well let's fire away well bryan
yeah why don't you why don't we why don't you do about thirty seconds and i'll do thirty seconds and then we can work off of there
and i now am learning to be a sys admin
on not only pcs but professional work stations as well
and these are the big mamas ie sons hewlett packards absorb oh the big solburns and it so forth
and we have two pc's here we have an xt and then
recently we made a the command decision to go ahead and get the absolute top of the line because spouse is a programmer
and so we got one that could do enough and you know hold three different os's
as far as dos unix and os ii
no learning i'm learning to i'm learning to be one who knows what's he's doing
too many people you know misuse the word so i'd rather say i'm i am continually learning but my area my level of expertise is increasing almost daily
and yes i've got a pc and a work station at work and i and we have two pc's here at home
and the a lot of the new mama we're i've got aldus and micrographics on it as far as technical publishing and we do a quite a bit of church work with ours
and
you know some i i've found that the more we do with it seems the lord is pleased that we're
kind of this is this is part of giving back a portion of what he's given to us
so i don't mind because seems like the more we do there's the more stuff that's available that comes along and so forth
and
so rather than being niggardly and chintzy we've just said you bet boss seeing as how he was the one that enabled us to get the money to buy the 486
because the top of the line we've got well we've got a compatible to eight meg of ram and two hundred and eleven hard drives
uh-huh
huh like i said we bought a real steam burner
mainly because of spouse's unix because unix
takes well four megs minimum
of ram and then it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive
so the next size up was a two hundred and eleven and so
rather than just have one we went ahead and got two
at some point in time i'm going to do the mirroring experiment to where
one disc mirrors the other for fault tolerance
yeah she's a squirrel for contractor out at american airlines
so
right
well most recently the kinds of things i've been returned actually are
parts of you know repair parts
oh for cars or for plumbing parts that kind of thing actually surplus parts you know you need you think you need it and
want to make sure you've got everything you need and taking things back and so other than that you know i haven't had an opportunity where i've needed to return something due to poor service or you know failure of it
i guess
no i guess well the closest thing we did have is couple weeks ago starter on our daur daughter's car failed
and actually then it ended up with needing to found the parts but then
there were some very recent repairs on the starter done
and so my daughter took it back to the
repair shop that did the work for her hundred and forty miles from here and they gave her money back right away
presented you know tried to present a sound case for
defective equipment and
everything went very well
usually doesn't
certainly wouldn't make an extra trip for fifty dollars for a hundred miles but
she was headed back there so
worked out well how about yourself you had any recent experiences where with products that you've had to return
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
think they have considerable knowledge and you're not really convinced that they do and you almost end up bringing a third party in that you have trust in their competence
yeah
you know or you know i guess in situations like that are there other manufacturers or other companies that you can consult
this you know am i getting the right kind of story here
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yes
uh-huh
right that's true i mean i'm twenty six now and i came through high school with about the first generation that had computers in the classroom
and all that and it certainly has been good for me
so i see myself
you know when i learn a new system a new program or a new computer language that it's much easier for me than for let's say
my colleagues who are a lot older but just as intelligent and whatever
uh-huh
that's true
uh-huh
and what do you think that's just a question of becoming more aware or has it become less safe over the years
yeah i would agree with you
that's right
uh-huh
yeah i don't know i think a lot of what causes it is just economics
naturally
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i suppose it has
that's right it's
well let's see i think that the mass communication that we have in the world now is in general a good thing and i think it has its good points and
bad points but in general it's pretty positive
more or less yes i mean it is we have the
global village you know like maclean was saying but it doesn't
i don't think that it really means that we have a sense of community yet as a world
which
which hopefully maybe coming we'll have to see
uh-huh
right
well yeah that's definitely right i mean and when we're
dealing with other people's affairs for our own interests certainly is what i believe
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
i'm overweight and under exercised and can i can tell it affects me and i don't know why i can't make myself do it
well i used to i used to do more things currently i've just gotten a they're a really nice tape angela lansbury has done and it's very mild it's mostly stretching but i've
more mornings than not i will do at least ten minutes with her which is a good starter then there's a twenty minute part afterwards that i tell myself every day when i get back i have a
erratic schedule you know and when i come back in i'll do the twenty minutes uh-huh but anyway
and then quit i
it's hard to schedule in what about you
yes
um-hum
yeah
oh
oh i see
yeah
yeah
and so do you do it
uh-huh and you're thinking about getting them
oh yeah
yeah
yeah that
it is and it is hard to do i mean it is easier to do at home even the walking which i can do right here the idea of getting in a car to drive to a
a place which a number of my friends keep suggesting
just exhausts me because i drive so much in my job and i just am not going to get back in the car to drive somewhere you know and there are all these people there and you have to put on these clothes and i so i'd much rather do it here now my daughter has a
a bike but it's a real bike and she cycles and she can put it on a thing but you have to be the right size to fit that
i've thought i've thought about doing that this tape is nice walking as i say is one that i really like i'm concerned about flexibility i'm almost fifty and i can you know begin to feel a little of that
yes yeah my legs
yes
well there is there is that is a plus and i did do that i used to do it and it and it is a plus and i almost took tai che that's something that's interested me for a long time and i
oh it is beautiful and it seems like it combines a lot of things so you know sort of a mental attitude as well as the physical but
yeah that's the problem and he just says has to be you know i've got a class opening at nine thirty on saturday and you can every once in a while go to a different class but that's when you're supposed to come
and actually i hadn't been doing any saturday trainings and then all of a sudden
right when the class opened
you know
hi
books i've actually i am reading a couple of different books
one is
a story well it is not a story it is a collection of
of memos supposedly written by howard hughes that was
was contacted by this guy who had these memos he wanted to sell and they were they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the corporate headquarters in los angeles
they on i think it was romain drive or romain street or something there in los angeles they used to have a or i guess they still do had a
big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a
you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected he was a great collector of everything he
he didn't he didn't throw anything away and supposedly this guy had been breaking there for he was a like you know burglar had been breaking in there awhile and had ended up
he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect and they broke in one night and found a bunch of memos that were supposedly from
from hughes to his main
main assistant back in the fifties and well i guess in the sixties up until his death
so it's pretty interesting work so
yeah it's a it's a little
it's a little hard it's a it's a you have to plod through it and you know it doesn't have a real story or any plot you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on
no i have not seen it but it's but it is it is real interesting
a book about the bermuda triangle but it's about it's a real good book that a guy wrote who was a research librarian he wrote sort of
debunking many of the
the myths many of the myths of the triangle were actually could be explained and you know
and the reason i was i hadn't picked it back up was in light of the all the
a collection of a flight of five navy adventures at the end of world war two right after world war two and they were they were lost and so
he had a very good case for the fact that they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water and because he
he mentions he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth and it's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and couldn't find their way back
no i haven't
yeah i would i would like to too because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her you know possibilities of where she have might have been
yeah
right
yeah so that's pretty much for right now that is what i have been reading i kind of like to read different stuff and i like to read a novel every now and then but i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time
yeah
yes
yeah i read that too i got it right after it came out my
you know he was an assistant district attorney in chicago at and while he was writing the book and
my sister-in-law lives in chicago and she had before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this guy is you know from here and
i read it and really liked it and then about that is when it really got big and so i
i really enjoy
bonfire of the vanities i haven't read that although i have heard it is pretty good
yeah that is what i have heard i saw the movie and
yeah
right
right
i know
yeah
interested in a lot of that but i got a lot of books that i intend to read but i have not been able to yet you know for one reason or another
oh gosh i don't i don't really have a list because i just kind of i just have all the books out you know i have book shelves and i have them all out and usually when i am through with one i will go in and
look through i have one now and i can't remember the name of it that i that i got is the sister-in-law in chicago usually sends me for my birthday or christmas or something will send me another good book and
i have one and i can not remember the name of it is supposed to be a mystery
well we usually do things that have to do with families because i have a family of four so
yeah
how about you
have you found one in dallas that you like
yeah
yeah
they just opened up an olive garden here in plano
do you like it there
huh
yeah we've been meaning to try this one out here
do you guys like what kind of food do you like
yeah
me too when i go out i like to have things that i don't cook at home you know when just he and i go out then it
uh-huh
yeah what makes you go back there
yeah i was gonna say price is probably my biggest concern
yeah
it seems like you can get the same menu for lunch cheap have you ever tried that just going for lunch and then
oh yeah i've heard of that where is it
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
in almost any restaurant that's almost the case that we've seen
yeah
we've you know tried most of the places around here and that's kind of where we stay
oh gee
have you tried the louisiana purchase do they have any of those over there
those are good and it's kind of cajun i usually don't like spicy food but that's real good especially lunch you know for the same reason because it's got some atmosphere and yet the price is good
my husband really likes chinese food so we go chinese just a little mom and pop kind of places
more so than the bigger
yeah
yeah
just authentic that's all it you know it says authentic on the outside
no not necessarily
when i go out with my husband i just want to be able to talk to him so that doesn't lend itself to that and when i'm with my children
i really like the black-eyed pea but i also think that's real noisy have you ever been to a black-eyed pea
it's got such a open atmosphere and clanking and banging that i love the food but it is really noisy
no i think that's pretty much what makes me go
um-hum
right
um-hum
huh
um-hum
um-hum
huh
huh
um-hum
um-hum
as opposed to any of the other sorts
though i guess a bread and breakfast or something might be a suggestion for you if you like the air condition type
uh-huh the yeah i've
done things i guess mostly
upstate michigan the adirondacks white mountains appalachian trail kinds of things i prefer going out either
with one other person or by myself for about a week
and i guess i just look at it as i time i can get away from it all and
kind of rely on my own resources a bit although i guess i haven't gone survival camping where i actually got to scrape together all my food i've always carried it with me but
still it's you know nice to get away from civilization every once in a while and
enjoy the wildlife
um-hum
huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum yeah i end up well yeah i mean i do a lot of like even weekender kind of things i go out for just one or two nights it's not my favorite thing but i can do it a lot more often so like over at the particularly in the
the fall and spring when the insects haven't come out yet where they're already gone
you know i spend almost every weekend up in the mountains and i guess i live about five hours away from
some place to go hiking where i am now
pardon me
no it's not bad and yeah i mean if it's if you can find somebody who's
you know willing to go out for several days you know and can handle that sort of thing which
isn't everybody you run across obviously who's willing to
for canoeing and you know there are places you can drive in and park and they've got the usual kinds of campgrounds and stuff but you can also just you know bushwack or go on semi trailed areas
and just get three days from any place that's civilization
and that's kind of fun
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh boy
huh
um-hum
yeah it's funny when you talk about you know this it sort of reminds me that every time i'm
telling somebody about like a camping trip and i've done quite a few say with my sister is the stuff that you remember isn't you know really so much the
the normal everyday you know oh this is a nice scene or something like this it's remember when are we had to put up the tent on the side of the hill and we kept sliding down to the bottom of the tent or you know when the tent's blowing down or when you wake up in the middle of the night and there's a hurricane and you know it's
um-hum
yeah the
i think that had we had the war or had we not had the war we'd a had a lot similar effect upon the population in terms of the freedom era as it were
i think what we saw was a phenomenon of a large number of young people at one time that were of the age of decision without the maturity to handle it
and you know richard nixon is my hero because he kept me out of that place
and my number was six i was going yeah and
yeah
yeah forget that you're not going
well i quit college when they when they moved out
went into construction
is it was it worth while from who's point of view
well i think one of the major points that a lot of people including myself missed until recently is the fact that
we could have annihilated
the north had we wanted to
well even at even at the not on the you know the gross tactical but on the on the very minute tactical arena
you know they were sending out you know eight or nine guys to engage a company
you know and they'd get wiped out you wonder why you know and
at every turn the tacticians were denied access to information which is a biggie and components you know whatever it took to do the job by the politicians
why because somebody was getting rich i found that everywhere you look if you find the money you'll find out why
and dow chemical had a real good thing going you know dow chemical had a photographer at every demonstration
yes and if your picture was in that demonstration you didn't get hired by dow chemical
yeah
and dupont was doing a lot of that too
yeah
well it's a big part of their market
they have no moral conscience
and that goes into and it and it's all tied together too i kind of believe that the vietnam event i'm not gonna call it a war or a police action it was an event
that the main
push for that was outside the united states our involvement for one thing we were on the wrong side
you know we were on the side of the fascist dictator and you know ho chi minh if you've read any of his writings he was a democrat
you know he wanted democracy
but he was forced to sleep with
bass fishing in fact we just came from a tournament this weekend huh
this one was just a one day sometimes we have two days
it's with the ti bass club
so
uh-huh
and so i got one that was just fourteen inches so i weighed it in it was a little over a pound
well we have the individual you weigh in as individuals and then you combine your totals as a team so they award prizes for individual and team
so
yeah in our club we
the lewisville ti we have our club and we all fish together once a month and then once a year we get together with the rest of the ti bass clubs and we compete as a club against the others
yeah we have good time
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
ooh how fun
uh-huh
yeah
wow um-hum
i bet
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow that sounds neat huh
uh-huh
oh i would love to
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
wow
yeah you ever been deep sea fishing
uh-huh
we yeah we've been a couple of time well i just went once and i got so seasick i never went back
that
oh it was that was the first fish i'd ever
oh this is kind of tough i don't too often watch you know shows that are on a regular basis
i don't have a lot of time and i don't really like some of them to tell you the truth i mean i don't think they have any redeeming value
but oh i watch things like sixty minutes every week
ooh
yeah just something like that for you know
end of the evening type of thing but
how about you
yeah i don't get that so i don't have that choice
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah there's a couple of those i've seen once in a while i can't think of the name of the one that has the military
fellow i mean he's playing a military part he's the husband of the girl on designing women
yeah you know it was on one time when i saw it and you know it it's pretty cute
yeah
uh-huh
yeah no i don't
i guess there's some things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly
on saturdays they have a variety of things and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time but
they have programs on house repairs and how to build things and they have a calligraphy show and i do calligraphy so i watch that
and they have a lot of cooking shows
and oh you know i'll just sort of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those i don't sit and watch them but i enjoy some of it and especially if i'm
cooking on a saturday evening or something and one of those is on it kind of inspires me
uh-huh
yeah
yeah we do some of that in i'm fact i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on tv than you know other kinds of things
yes
yeah
yeah well going to the movie can be unbelievable
yeah
uh-huh
yeah that's true
yeah
yeah
yep
yeah we do too it too many other things to do and too much going on
right i agree
uh-huh
right
yeah
okay well we probably exhausted that huh
okay i enjoyed talking to you
okay good-bye
all right go
good
is what do they what do they give you stock in the company you work for
right
yeah that sounds good
what company is that
excuse me
interleaf never heard of it
oh okay
yeah but i get a i get a pretty good i work for the city of new york
and i get a pretty good health plan
and
yeah the health plan's pretty good and we get they also have a deferred compensation plan which is similar to what you're talking about where they'll take out money tax free from your income and invest it
and it's a group investment so you i think you also save fees
it's like a 401k plan except they don't they don't contribute
right
yeah i think i think you can take out the money anytime you want but you'll pay you'll pay taxes on it and you're better off waiting until you retire when you are probably going to have less income or some something like that
yeah
wow that's really good
right
if you own oh okay i see
right
hello
yeah it was a width away that's why it's every time i talk it sounds weird but yeah there's other benefits too noneconomic i mean there's
there's benefits just in working for a big organization i think in that you have a lot of different people doing a lot of different things and
okay
right well that's working for the city is somewhat like that except for my unit you know i have control over what goes on in my unit and just that
but what i mean is i say for instance i'm an attorney a collection attorney for the city of new york and in the environmental control board and
i'm i've learned so much about computer systems and sharing of information all these managerial type things that i never thought i'd be involved with and if i was in private practice i'd never be able to learn all that stuff
yeah well i think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year
yeah
yeah
oh i go for that yeah
in fact i'm a little worried about this one coming up here we have a long weekend and it sounds like it's gonna be a little bit on the cool side
without rain
that's getting back to a little bit chillier
yeah i'm not certain either but you're probably right
i'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature
hm
yeah you're probably right
yes as a matter of fact i heard the weather the other day on tv and i think it was one day this week a year ago
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it wasn't just a super bad storm but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the late spring time
oh wow
hm
yeah that is pretty unusual
and you really take notice of it too
hm
wow
yeah i don't like that super cold stuff
i just don't move very well when it's that cold
okay good-bye
all right
do you have any friends who have children
and what do they say about finding adequate child care i think that may be the key word
right
well we've certainly found that to be true indeed we've
our children are now eleven and nine and we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things like that by that name
and found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us at one point in time we've had au pairs
then that worked for a while but they were really adequate ones were really tough to find it takes that
that mixture of a very mature college student
who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time
and the interest to the children
well that's true and that's something that we're struggling with now as
oh yeah
you know any you
much as
other cultures might disagree our lives don't revolve around our children
well it certainly is
if i can gather the other side of the coin for a moment it is such an honor and a thrill
to be a parent
that most of the time it's worth it
you know i just have to be honest about it it's not always worth it
there are those times when i think jeez if i didn't have children i could be out playing bridge or golf
well we were lucky when our children were that age and
having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children and
and felt that bond of safety and feeling of safety
and leaving them with them as small children
but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older in that
care givers are not
omniscious omniscipotent they're they are not all things to all people or all children
oh yeah i got a nine year old i'd trade happily for a babe in arms today
oh you don't know what happens after they get in school
oh yes now we have one takes piano lessons at somewhere on one afternoon and the other one of course can't do the same thing
and it has to be somewhere else and no it's not adequate to sit and wait
no but that's just that will not do
of course and but we are helping we are you know we are being cooperative what's wrong with you don't understand this that's just the way their minds work and it's almost everyday
yeah
well i've been finding out that i really am a nice person but it's been hidden for many years
because i didn't need it
yeah and it stays low a lot
absolutely not
that's true what one leads the other you know
and if you
of course
you don't you don't think that good prevails
we're having such fun my wife and i were both only children
and we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends
just make good friends
that's true
well what's frightening is a parent to see things that you don't really understand
and then you don't really know what happened we gave up on one babysitter because we came home one night and found
pieces of
ribbon you know hair ribbon
tied in a chair
where obviously she had
okay you go first
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i grew up in new york and the place or not new york city upstate new york
and i went to the city of rochester school district and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs
and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but
the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial and one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had just one school system
and that would result in some could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs
and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with
as a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasn't as many advanced placement courses when i was a senior as some other schools had
of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the problem with that is then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
why is that
why is that
right
right
right
um-hum
i ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice and i think the difference for me was that my parents were
you know they were definitely they were always there was like well yeah of course you're going to study and do well i mean that's the way of course are you know
i understand that well and you have a little bit better newspaper the dallas morning news is a good paper lubbock is kind of small and the ajs
kind of dominant there's no competition so what you get is what you get we used to take the paper every day and i finally quit taking it because it stacked up i never got around to reading it and so i try to take you know weekend papers
yeah
it is
uh-huh
it's frustrating to me because i really wish that i did have more
i don't know what do i want to say i wish that i was around more news it's frustrating when i don't know what's going on i feel like it's hit and miss and
i haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis somebody will say oh did you hear about this that happened last week and it might be local and it might be national and i'm
yeah
um-hum
yeah that's true
that's true
oh no
a little bit that worries me because i feel like the news is so biased and yes they report facts and yes you can get an idea of what's going on but
you know it's an and i wish they would just report the incident and then leave the commentaries out but so many times you get well
this is my opinion of what he meant by that and i'm like who are you to judge you know just report the facts
um-hum
yes
um-hum
i don't know you know so much during the gulf war they would ask questions that
you wouldn't want broadcast it's like if you tell us the answer to that you're telling our enemy what your strategy is but they keep asking these questions and i thought it was really well i don't know asinine actually stupid
yes
i agree
yeah
yeah that's true that's true and it's frustrating
so i guess i guess when i get to listen to the news it's probably television or radio i see very little paper but
i don't get to see that as much as i want and when i do i'm wondering why i wanted to see it so bad so
yeah
exactly
well i'm glad that it makes me feel like i'm not alone though in the world i used to think that i was probably the only one that just
i don't know was running around so much i look at other women workers or men at work that have kids and families and i'm like how do they seem so together all the time i always feel like i'm running a rat race
so i guess news is just part of that rat race for me
yeah
exactly
well
yeah
that's incredible too
well i appreciate talking to you
have a good evening
bye-bye
i had a i have a boat i live on the water and i have a boat that i like to take out pretty much every day and
i took it into the shop to be repaired and i brought it back and it didn't run
and i got to i had to i took it back and told them what was wrong and
took it back out and it still didn't run three times
i had to take it back
was a mechanic mechanic's problem he didn't really know what was wrong with it and
you thought he had fixed it but he not didn't
eventually it got to the point where i said i don't think you know what you're doing i'm going to take it somewhere else and
so i did and someone else finally fixed it
i paid him original money to do some other work that he did right but the rest of it i didn't
didn't pay him
and
yeah
oh good
yeah so they took it back and just
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
what aggravating is how much how much time and effort you expect things to be
to be right the first time
yeah
a little black box that
tells you when to bring it back in to for repairs
yeah
that's not too
yeah
yeah
lately not for clothing
but i bought a lot of stuff i remodeled the house and i bought a lot of a lot of new kitchen and new fixtures and everything
and one thing that we i did buy that i had the only problem was a sears stove
and when i got it it'd a big dent on the top of it
so i had to
all of our children are
well two of them are back in the house now but they're all grown twenty one and over
so
i guess like everybody else soccer games and all sorts of games and carpools and
traveling and they we seem to be together enough
was there was always one parent here at least because we'd never usually leave together
and i usually work teach at night and my wife was here in the daytime and i mean at night and then i was here most of the day if they were when they were here so
they didn't spend a lot of time by themselves
three
two girls and a boy
so
oh you are
well we had they were all away and now there's one's coming back from college and the other one has just graduated back home so
um-hum
oh absolutely yeah that's the we didn't have a tv for three and a half years when they were in early school for some reason and they did so much better and then we went back to tv's
you can just see it that
um-hum where'd your kids go to school
oh
they weren't here in north dallas huh oh
uh-huh
yeah well i don't know that i just that's that tv's probably one of the problems and then both parents working and
that's a i don't think a good situation but i don't -magine it'll change
right
so
you probably didn't if
that's right if you had to work
it's just almost impossible
especially when they get up to the age where they have so many things they want to do on their own so
um-hum
so well my all three of mine ran sports so we spent an
lot of time with their different sports activities because they all played and
now they're all in college or one two one out and two in still in college so
um-hum
yeah
so well we probably if they're alive and kicking we probably did a decent job
right
that's true
so
anyway well
oh great yeah
i would hope so
yeah that will be
yeah that'll
that'll be fun look forward to that you're gonna fly out there
oh you are
ooh i've done that a few times
that's a tough drive
sure you just gonna try to spend the
spend the night somewhere
well we always stopped at pecos that seemed like it was a good
oh yeah well that'll be great
so well anyway it's good to talk to you
i don't i don't know i think
they usually come on and say something don't they
well that's all right
how long have you been with ti
oh
oh okay
i teach history
yeah
so
yeah there's not many people like it but it's you can get them get them hooked on it if your pretty good
the boy is going
in austin texas
in houston
so we probably been having relatively similar weather
yeah although it's recently been fairly humid
yeah we
um-hum
yeah it's nice today i
i guess about a little less than five years now
oh it varies i mean occasionally it gets up over a hundred but it's not
that's not really well i don't know i was going to say it wasn't not typical but i guess there is
quite a phase this quite a period this summer that is was a it stayed over a hundred mid to high nineties it's fairly typical houston doesn't get quite as hot actually because the humidity
the gulf yeah
um-hum
the humidity
yeah
uh-huh
right
yeah well i
yeah
well i i'm originally from kansas and south west kansas which is extremely dry and it's the opposite but i mean that real serene heat
and very cold in the winter but
it we had a streak of something like thirty eight days in a row over a hundred degrees
it just absolutely sounds absurd and one day it actually hit one hundred and fifteen degrees in the shade
oh i know i know
well that's
oh i mean it was like you know thirty degrees below zero
yeah and i you know i had just bought a little mgb that i was going to fix up and you know sand it down and get it all fixed up and i and i had never bothered to check the antifreeze in it
and you know here is this freezing day and i got my heaters up full blast trying to stay warm and
you know and so i you know i tried to jump start it i couldn't get it in it still i mean had some it was slushing and i tried to start it i couldn't the batteries dead and tried to jump start it i couldn't it didn't have a jumper cable ran to the store and by the time i got back it had frozen out
and after that i decided i was going to go live some place where it was warm
yeah
well it's you know i finally decided that snow is kind of a neat thing to visit
you know when you when you felt like it's ice cold all white christmas and some things like that it's a nice thing to go visit but it's not something that i want to live in day in and day out
well you actually get kind of get used to it after a while i mean and in the cold really it doesn't get at you that much because you of course you learn how to dress well and the houses are well insulated and stuff
i actually i moved from there to new orleans and
so what do you do to exercise
um-hum
hm
i guess i play softball one night a week and i backpack a lot over the summer
yeah -at's that's about the extent of it i mean i don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise
but i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise but i do it mostly for fun
about forty five fifty minutes
yeah it can be a pain
basically i work on a campus so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the campus to the gym use the shower there but it's enough of a pain that
i did it consistently one year i would commute everyday
but it just became such a pain i mean we were talking you know forty five or fifty minutes for biking and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind
and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff it was a big hunk of the day and then of course another hour to get back home
so i've been doing that less and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends
i guess mostly i bike on my own i've got a touring bike
though i haven't gone on any extended trips with it how about you what kind of biking do you do
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hm
um-hum
oh i see
um-hum
it's good to have a partner
are you thinking of doing any like centuries or
um-hum yeah i just wondered if you're were gonna do that mostly or more like you know
touring like from vermont or you know that kind of thing i mean people seem to get into different aspects one is more of a distance and one's more just you know they wanna
put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
oh that's nice
hm
wow yeah
um-hum
yeah i'm not sure why that is i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less i mean maybe it's because of the winters
or maybe just because you know there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
um-hum
hm
oh that's terrific
um-hum
as an adult for just about the past three years or so
you know i guess the last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago and yeah i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while
no i haven't no
hm
um-hum
oh that's great yeah i've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse you know it gets it down to about forty yeah
yeah
yeah
on average yeah
no i'm not that hard-core i mean there are some people in fact there are a lot of people who'll ride outside in the snow they've got a mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires
and i don't do that i basically i pretty much lay off for the winter uh-hum i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because it'll help your balance when you're indoor training
but i just you know more or less stuck to like an exercise bike and that kind of thing
the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore i'll lay off of it more
oh yeah i try to go someplace pretty different you know every week i rotate around about four different routes
from my house or i'll sometimes come in to school it's nice coming it's nice riding to school it's all along a canal path
so that's fairly picturesque and so it's a good ride as long as you're not doing it everyday it's a good ride
yeah
yeah
well it was good talking to you
okay you too
bye
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum yeah have you been following the progress of the hubble space telescope
hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i think it's pretty exciting that they can it'd be interesting to see they can find other planets that are that'd be more habitable to you know humans and
yeah i think i would be very interested in space travel in the future if it's if it you know is at all possible
well we know if the they make the advances that they've been making that maybe age will no longer age or even physical abilities may not be a barrier anymore
and that came
well the space program was one of the big you know backers of that and it's amazing you know you it's hard to imagine what life is like without it now
uh-huh yeah i've seen him before
um-hum that's true
um-hum
right
yeah
yeah that is that is something that'd be hard to think about i agree
you know we like you say we're used to finite things and something that's infinite is just incomprehensible
but yeah i would like to see them
do more that area make space travel more something that the ordinary person could enjoy
oh sure of course that's true
um-hum
yeah that's true
um-hum
yeah i guess you don't really think about it too much i guess you're always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff but you it it's in a subconscious you don't
think you know someone would make you sit down and write down what you know things that you've improved upon you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list but you just don't think about them
and that's true i think
you know we've got different programs at work you know to make it visible to management that we're doing things better
oh
well i think
i think the biggest thing that's important is to is to learn enough about the student to match the student well to the to the school
and one thing i learned i went undergraduate to harvard and then came out to berkeley and it's pretty clear that there are some people who thrive at berkeley
and there are some people who just die here because of the amount of support that's given and the amount of bureaucracy you have to deal with and other things like that
in a large public school i think in general
and this is a school with some thirty thousand students
and it is set up in such a fashion that students register for classes months in advance and if they don't get them
they may not get a chance to take them that year average graduation has crept up closer and closer to five years largely because of the number of students who can't get all of the courses to fulfill their major on time
on the hand this is
it is and it's happening in a lot of public schools because of budget cuts but on the other hand what it does provide is for the
for students who need a chance to be forced to fend for themselves
who have perhaps been too isolated this is a case where they're forced to do that
and my wife went here as an undergraduate she had been sort of protected right through high school and had to learn to
to make it on her own and she graduated from the place in four years by learning to be smart and picking courses that at the right times and right priorities and i can see that as advantageous but there are a lot of people for whom this is just a waste of time
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
just to be able to find a job that you would qualify for
yeah
well
i think one of the reasons that i don't see that as much of a problem
see i would encourage people to go into college not knowing what they want to do because so many of the high schools have done such a bad job at introducing different areas
that it may be that what you want to do and it may be a very practical thing to go into doesn't seem attractive because what you've learned of it so far is not interesting a lot of people are turned off from math because of high school math
and going to a school that offers a lot of choice
and taking your first year or two to explore what the choices are still gives you plenty of time and
and then eventually focus on a single major i certainly wouldn't say to go to a liberal arts school that doesn't have a strong science program
and i'd even encourage a liberal arts school with an engineering program but i tend to look i don't like what i see from the students who are graduating here with engineering degrees
where seventy five or eighty percent of their time is spent in a prearranged technical curriculum
and they are moving here towards a program where they have a bachelor of arts and a master of science combined where you get a general education with guaranteed admission into an engineering degree for a master's degree
and that seems like a good compromise it's
hi
as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i took on a painting project in my bathroom
and i had wallpaper up
i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all weekend because the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down and that had to dry
and then the spackling had to dry a day and then the painting took another day
no i just painted
no actually the wall behind the paper was smooth so i just used a like a semigloss
and
well no not really i need to it looks so bad our you can see where those spackling marks were i need to either paper back over it or do something
yeah it covered the spots pretty good but it didn't excuse me it didn't
it just didn't look as smooth as i wanted it to
uh-huh
uh-huh
was it like a primer
would you put a huh uh-huh
yeah
oh my goodness that's an awful lot
that the house be painted before we bought it and it was fairly reasonable we have a brick house but all the trim
around the house was if i remember right it was like five hundred dollars
yeah
so that wasn't too bad
no i haven't
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh so they did do a good job
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah as a matter of fact what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a
a blue and the blue even so many years two years later or so it doesn't match
you know
the very same type of paint and everything
so
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's right
white yeah that's what we're trying to get ours to look like
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i see
huh she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what
okay white
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well what about the lighting did it make a big difference
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
so that you get some the color doesn't really matter for because you have that light
all time oh
i see
uh-huh
yeah really no kidding
it is a lot of work a lot of work
nice talking to you thanks a lot bye
yes i have a macintosh se thirty
um-hum
what do you use yours for mostly
uh-huh
well i do a lot of word processing and spread sheets and data base and about the only thing i am i'm just starting to get in into a little bit more communications now i've just today ordered a fax modem so i'll be able to
send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you don't have to make a hard copy that way
are you using windows
uh-huh
um-hum well the one thing i used to use a i've never used an ibm actually i used to use a just an apple two e which of course is looks pretty primitive now
but i don't have any real programming capabilities on my mac right now i don't have any compilers
i use it in my business
i do consultation and testing of various kinds for english as a second language programs
that's exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly you seem to be better informed than the average person on that
um-hum
right well now we what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though most of the stuff that i do is not interactive
and then i use it for data analysis on testing so
well just actually just item analysis statistical analysis of the tests
you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing
and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it's involves a lot of spread sheet use
yeah
oh the old
the old apple the original apple had what yeah forty eight i guess didn't it
my goodness
um-hum
well the se thirty goes up to eight
but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and get another possibly another hard disk i don't know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory
okay well i can go ahead and start and tell you mine we're from san antonio and that's where i grew up so i was used to the heat and out here right now gosh it gets to about seventies high seventies and it gets very cold at night
and monterey sits right on the coast
and i don't know if your familiar with the california coastline but we're about two hours about a two hour drive south of san francisco
and it's really nice it's a big area for people to come from the different countries mostly like japan and germany and england and they usually go to carmel
and vacation on the beaches so it's pretty nice year round but cool always cool in the evenings and warm in the warm in the summer but it's stays pretty cool even during the winter for as nice as it is
and we usually get a fog right about oh i guess about four o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast
and then it usually breaks back off again the next morning and if you go just a little bit ways in i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards salinas
so what's it like down there
oh really well at least you've got some
uh-huh
oh well that's good
uh-huh
have y'all been having any heat waves or
like the ninety degree
uh-huh
uh-huh oh well that's good for this time of year
uh-huh
uh-huh oh
do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff up there
oh i bet
uh-huh
oh
yeah
well that's real nice because i can remember two years ago that in about february the hundred degree weather started in san antonio and just continued
y'all weren't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you
uh-huh oh okay
oh gosh
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
oh is that what dallas is okay yeah
uh-huh
um-hum yeah san antonio has that same problem when the rains come it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes so i didn't realize that dallas had that same problem
huh golly well we could use some rain up here we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought
up here and they had a pretty good early spring and we got quite a bit of rain but it wasn't enough to offset what they had lost over the past four years
and so they're still talking water rationing this summer
so it would seem strange because in san antonio we had lived out west of san antonio in castroville
and the water in medina lake and that area was really going down and they were considering
that they might have to do water rationing and then i thought oh gee i'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the california pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and there's no problem with water and then i came here and found out they were in
you know in the four year drought so i said well gee this is pretty much like texas and it pretty much is in the middle of the summer they have rolling hills around here but
they turn to golden dead grass for the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green
but it's a really nice area
it's just it's just such a change from texas because i had grown up with the heat and was used to essentially like you said yeah you have the cold winter and then you have the hot
but it is it's a really nice change of pace
it's just so much easier up here and you don't have to worry about the high humidity does dallas get high humidity
or is it pretty dry
uh-huh
yeah it seems like san antonio has been increasing in humidity over the years because i had lived in san antonio for about twenty years
and it just seemed like every year it just got a little more humid a little more humid and here it's well it's right by the ocean but it's not the same as at corpus -t corpus you get that humid salty
feeling in the air but here the well the water is extremely cold up here you can lay on the beach all you want but to go if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit
and a thick wet suit at that because it's just extremely cold and i for some reason i guess it's because of that cold ocean
water that the air is always cool it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling so i really like that about this area
and we just hadn't expected it we were used to what gulf coast weather was like and we came here to pacific coast weather it's just completely different and it's much nicer
so
uh-huh it does and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region but we like it so it's a nice change so we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and see what all the pacific coast is like
and so it's been good
oh i imagine that virginia i imagine gets really humid doesn't it
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh oh i'll have to try that out because i had heard that north carolina was sort of like that
and they like they get the snow but they said it doesn't really get messy and it doesn't really hang around that long and
well
oh gee whiz
oh gosh oh well i hope it moves up this way but i'm sure it won't
okay well you think that takes care of the time and
okay well i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in texas and
yeah good luck to you okay we'll see you bye
well yeah that
i think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be
uh-huh relaxed
and laid back and stuff and
i think so i think so and a lot i think people are used to now saying what's
what's on their minds more up front than they used to be
right
yeah i think so i think women have come out more too on like child abuse and the wife beatings and like you said pro-choice and whatnot
i think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women i think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something
no huh-uh
and i've got a ten year old and you know he thought he knows about condoms and
um-hum
no i don't i think that's stupidity on parents' part i mean that's sex is rampant and it always will be and
i mean the boys are very open because that's all i have is boys so that's all i'm around basically is boys
but they talk about things that i my brother didn't talk about until he was in college
go
but it it's interesting listening to them i think i think the social changes in them
i think i see it more with that generation than i do with like our generation
yeah i do too
i know well my son the my fourth grader he is in
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
right okay well that's good position to be in i guess if you don't have to worry about budgeting that what's left over goes to investments
so you don't you don't then actually plan that this month i'm gonna invest five hundred or five thousand or whatever it might be
uh-huh
so you always put aside at least five hundred dollars okay well i guess that's sort of a budget then at least partial
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum sure
right
um-hum okay
right sure well i think that's true of all of us the well my wife and i both work and we do plan
we try to plan major purchases and we have agreed that we don't spend over a hundred dollars on anything without talking with the other one
so i wouldn't just go out and buy a
well that's true that's true certainly when you're single you don't have to worry about consulting with someone else and that type of thing
uh-huh sure you have a committee meeting of all yourself me myself and i okay
yeah i see
uh-huh
okay
um-hum
sure
so you're careful rather than just extravagant and just grab anything that happens to meet your fancy
right
right
sure
okay well we do that same kind of planning in that if we're going to get something you know whatever it may be and we're comfortable and have most the things we need or want the
we'd you know certainly shop around before buying the new computer or the new vcr or something even once we had planned
that that's what we were going to get we wouldn't just go read the ad in the paper and run right down and buy it or something even if we'd planned to get the thing
oh well
well mostly rock
well i like well i like different you know different things but
primarily you know rock and roll
oh you know well you i really like more of the modern stuff you know but i like the oldies you know they're okay
but i you know i listen mostly to the you know the modern stations
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
see now i don't like country and western
i don't like you know most of it i don't like but i recently saw that garth brooks show
and i thought he was terrific and i really thought i mean i thought he was a great you know really wonderful entertainer the way he you know he was very good
i don't like twainese no i non't
oh he's really not that country i mean i've heard him sing stuff that really doesn't sound too you know
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh well
yeah that's true
oh
um-hum
yeah
and my son i have a son he's twenty four and of course he hates country music and he said ma i can't believe you're gonna watch that i said i have to find out
my best friend said she likes him i said i if linda likes him i said he's not he couldn't be all wrong you know i mean he's there's got to be something good about the guy
i don't know but i mean and his songs were you know i liked them were they weren't that silly country western stuff that you know they used to do years ago you know with dopey lyrics you know very simple lyrics
you know they're
yeah oh there are but yeah i think as a whole it's gotten more definitely more sophisticated in the you know in the past few years
i usually listen to either the classic rock it's ninety two or one oh two
yeah
and then my husband loves the oldies you know every time he gets in the car he sticks on the oldies station
yeah
uh-huh
well it
uh-huh
oh she's given up the naps
but well my main exercise the only one i've ever stuck to at all is walking
most everyday but it you know it fluctuates i'll do real good for a while and then i'll be off of it for a while just depending on what's happened but the last
couple of years my husband is an accountant and he moved his office to the house and i work for him
so that helps because we're at home and i can get out and walk a lot better than when i was working in an office
so that has helped
but anything else
um-hum i will admit though when i
do walk i feel so much better you know when i get out and do that two miles it takes about thirty minutes just our neighborhood is just kind of very flat land with sidewalks and
i really do and i smoke and i can tell that it just immediately if i've been coughing or something you know it just immediately seems to clear my lungs up
but
well i got a lot of exercise though the last four or five days i have two grandchildren
three months and nineteen months and my daughter and son-in-law went on a
well and the baby was sick so he wasn't good you know so it was one on one i mean i had to take one and he had to take the other one and it was busy
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
right when you were talking about mentally losing sleep it also made me think of one other thing walking
does for me when i do it does help me mentally you know if i'm worried about something or whatever and i get out and do that
walk it just i don't know it just sort of helps your mental attitude too
so i miss that when i don't do it
but
well nice to talk to you
no sir not to my knowledge they've always had it
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
well kirk is capital punishment is that like death yeah right uh-huh
well the death by the electric chair and let's see the last time that i was privy to it death by electric chair
um-hum you see one of our problems is down here since we were one of the later states to join
is that murder was i mean horse thieving and was rampant down here in the old days and i bet you can go to any town within the state and find a hanging tree
and you know you stole somebody's horses or stole their cattle that was a capital offense and you got hanged from the nearest limb if you know you were caught
so it's got goes back to the old days now i don't know about maryland golly what they did in the old days
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah right
right um-hum
yeah
is that what you meant while ago when you said you know about putting them in prison actually what you meant what kind of contribution can they make if you don't murder them
right uh-huh
um-hum right
yeah
um-hum
yeah
what
well you know you have the christian view
and the christian view is to forgive you know and
and maybe try to rehabilitate
and of course when you do that you know then your costs go up on that measure and those who have lost someone you know feel like that the guy's escaped justice
and so you know i can see that point too i'm just kind of the old line that i believe if you go out and kill your neighbor you know you can look to lose your own life
and it's true that some people you know go out and commit a murder and they could really
lead on
doesn't bother you
well we differ there
it bothers me
i just feel like it's an invasion of my privacy
you know i you know there's a lot alcohol for example
i can go out and drink on the weekends and come in hung over and do a lot worse job
than if i go out on friday and
i don't know say take a hit of ecstasy and dance all night
not saying that i do but i'm just
i think alcohol's a whole lot worse drug and it's more widely accepted
i feel like it's okay if there's if there's cause somebody's performance is you know indicates that they're
they're obviously not all there they're
you know you got reason to suspect they may be doing drugs and he says sure you know take them down there and test them but
i think a lot of people are going to go out and
you know substitute something else for maybe what they would have done a lot of people i don't i personally don't smoke pot but a lot of people do and they do it in their own time at their at their at their own place
and they're going to find they're going to go out and drink instead because they know that it's their job on the line
and
you know i've been i've come to work hung over in the morning and i know i'm worthless
but
and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you
but there's i think there's a there's a big difference between use and abuse and i do agree that drug abuse should be punished
but if somebody's going to in their own home on their own time
in such a way that doesn't interfere with their responsibilities
you know do it do some drugs then that should be their business
yeah i do
i think i think that's true and i think that the key thing is the difference between use and abuse and a lot of people don't
they don't know how to
use drugs for recreational purposes without
it becoming you know a dominant force in their life
i mean yeah it's you know it's easy for me to say i'm going to go out on friday night and maybe
you know i don't have to work till monday and if i want to go out and drink a little beer or do something and just dance a lot or whatever
that's fine as long as i realize saturday that in order to you know i'm going to feel like crap that's just the way it is same thing if you drink but the thing is you don't get up and drink another beer to get over it
and unfortunately and i think cocaine's a good example it's just so much easier to just do some more do some more and then before you know it
you know you're always doing it
i don't know
i mean i work for ti so i don't do drugs you know
right
it's too big a risk yeah
but you're without a paycheck during that time
and i don't at least that's my understanding is even
you know the first time you go for counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work
i was that i was told that
somebody had some woman had
had a cold or something and had some cough medicine prescribed and her husband or maybe the other way around one of them anyway had
come down with the same thing and used some of the medicine and was tested the next day and failed and was out of a job until he went through counseling
and it's like you know i can't afford that kind of loss of income you know
i mean i've always been yeah the first time so what i'll go explain myself and
that's what you would think but i kind of i that's i you know i heard it through the grapevine so i don't i don't know firsthand but that's what i heard was that it was just
you know there were no
oh yeah you know you've got the same exact thing yeah
well i think
i don't know anybody personally either
i do know a lot of people that you know do use drugs recrela recreationally and there's such a big difference
yeah i don't know
it's kind of i've also been
you know known managers at ti i know one i guess i shouldn't make that a plural but
who drank on the job had whiskey in his desk drawer and you tell me what's worse
you know
yeah but
everybody covers up you know it's the good old boy thing
i don't know
i don't think so they don't test for it i mean
it's not illegal
well that's true
no i agree i think i believe in test for cause if somebody's performance
and i guess that there's the other argument is that well do you wait until they screw up you know and someone gets hurt
yeah but at the same time you know you're telling me that on some given day i'm going to walk in they're going to tell me go down and you know and go down to the health center and
you know pee in a jar or whatever it is no i haven't and so
no see i was i've been working for ti for almost eight years
i have to i have to honestly say that i drink more now than i did
because you know it's what i can get away with and if i'm going to go on the weekends
spend my money and you know i
if you don't drink you know you used to drink okay you go out and you want to party and that's
that's something you do when you're young and dumb i guess
you know
i'm not as young as i used to be but i'm still
no i don't smoke i quit doing that and i've tried to quit drinking but it's
the only thing left you know i quit doing drugs when ti said quit and it was no big deal you know it's like i wasn't
a regular drug user
but
i understand
i understand
i was around somebody today outdoors and they're smoking and it's like you know i smell it and i'm like well is this going into my bloodstream you know is this is there going to be enough there to get me
get me in trouble
so see it didn't use to bother me when i thought that you know if i come in there and they say
okay you tested positive now explain yourself and i could say yeah well i was around some people that were smoking pot but i wasn't but you know it's the idea that
you can't but at least you've got a chance whereas if they say for six weeks you don't have a job because you tested positive
that you know that's devastating how you know i can't live without my income for six weeks there's no way
exactly
so i don't know
yeah opposing viewpoints there
i said opposing viewpoints
for the most part
yes yeah
i see well i'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary but
things that have to be paid for you know just our bills and then
what's left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although we're not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs
yeah
right
right
uh-huh
right
yeah
right
we could no longer afford that monthly payment and now it's just seems
just such a large amount of money to spend that we do have a used car well he has a company car also but for our personal car we have a used car do you think that it's wiser to buy used
right
uh-huh
oh no
oh wow
wow
right
do you buy from dealers or from individuals
um-hum
right
right
yeah
okay
no we don't although we enjoy it we do it more when we have company come what about you
i've heard of that but i haven't been there where about is that
oh okay i i've been to cafe pacific
right
yes
before we moved to the area my brother lived in dallas for a number of years and we came up one time when my father was visiting and we all ate there and oh their seafood was wonderful
now where is the atlantic cafe
oh okay
no but i've heard that's really good too and
oh
oh
oh okay
uh-huh
well we really enjoy prime rib too and actually the steak and ale out here
we've gone to
my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on sunday monday or tuesday night and the time we went the prime rib was really good
uh-huh
yeah
oh
yeah
yes i'd i had heard that too
have you been to the little not for prime rib but the cafe de france right here on central expressway
oh okay
yes primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes but
during the week they often have a limited menu choice but very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup or salad
entrees and accompaniments and dessert and the my husband and i like veal a lot and their veal dishes have been good we've tried
different ones when they've had them
as one of the
um-hum
i yes no
right and
i haven't either one place and i've only been there for lunch but i went with a friend and we met her husband down on greenville down near the highway twelve area is gershwin's
oh i we just it was and we had the we both enjoy mushroom soup and linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did it was wonderful but
yes
it yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry
oh
oh
yes yeah
oh
it sounds wonderful
well that's one of the things that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant i love fresh berries and their
their fruits are always exceptional i don't i'm know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the farmer's market you can't find them like that and
uh-huh
i would too because well i guess because we don't go out very often when we do go out
in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess and it is it's a whole experience of course you want the food to be good but the atmosphere and service i think are important too
yeah
that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful it's called cafe max and it's at plano road and campbell
they have the most wonderful salads they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three
okay
okay
yeah most of mine's been pretty good although i'm i guess i'm like a lot of other people now i'm trying to pay off my credit cards and
i've done pretty good at it
yeah
uh-huh there is a big difference
yeah
yeah oh yeah i do that i do that but the rest like i said the rest of them i've been trying to pay off and get back on a cash basis except for gas it's too easy to run into the gas station
yeah what you
uh-huh
yeah
so
yeah well
yeah
well i've been pretty lucky in that respect i don't charge like i say i've i been trying to
to not charge except for emergencies
so but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards there's you know they have wonderful features they're there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever
that's true that's true
i try to i did switch to one
sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest
yeah compared to some of the other ones and you don't have an annual fee there and that helps
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
takes a long time that's right and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off your income tax that's you know
of course it's been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything so
so
well i've enjoyed talking to you
okay
bye-bye
okay
i watch evenings because i work all day i used to watch daytimes mainly like all my children that kind of thing
and then sometimes oprah and sometimes donahue but now it's mainly evenings
yes
i tape thirty something and l a law those are the two i like the best
i know it's going to be history i know
uh-huh
oh well
uh-huh
i know i'm amazed
huh-uh i'm surprised that i was surprised at the ending of you know with all the funny things happening and
different things
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know
i know isn't that funny
oh i don't usually like stuff that continues that's why i'm surprised i like those two shows because usually i like you know stuff that just ends sort of that you just you don't have to have watched you know
yeah i mean you don't have to
yeah you don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow so
you know i usually don't like that
uh-huh
i know
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
and what night is it on
oh
huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh he doesn't
um-hum
so he didn't go howl
oh how funny
huh
it's just a half hour or is it hour
oh
there's not many half hour shows it seems like that
uh-huh
yeah no i watch those if i
oh see i like sports
um-hum
uh-huh
i know
no i don't sit
i know who has time i don't have time to sit i know
that's why i don't get to watch that much i mean i watch nine o'clock i do okay because the kids are all in bed but before that i really there's not much time or like at six thirty i'll watch wheel of fortune or something like that
uh-huh no i like that no i'll watch game show kind of stuff but
yeah
did you send one
how funny
why do you think so few people vote then
um-hum
um-hum
what part what part would you say the big brother aspect plays the people that don't want to be called for
jury duty or things that they've heard that says you know well they use this registration for this purpose or that so they just don't bother
hum
okay and then what about the smaller election say some of the city elections even down to the school board type elections i guess there are so many
that you can weed out the ones that you really want to partake in
um-hum
well it's a shame that even the politician who wants to give out good information about himself
has trouble in virtually everything he does say that's positive or even mediocre gets attacked from the other side
such that he spends more of his time defending than he can putting forth any decent information
and then once you get off the candidate's personal information then you want to get into an actual issue and then how the candidate feels about that
i would say that it's much easier to deal with the public the media that's giving the information to the public is much easier to deal with any personality quirk or any negatives that they've found or any skeleton in the closet
than to try and first educate the public to the point where they can
listen to either side of a given issue
and it's pretty difficult to deal with some of the issues lets say that texas state railroad commission has to solve when you don't even fathom what the implications are of they're decision so who would you care who got in that position you know
right
right
um-hum
hum boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important doesn't it
yeah a lot more appointee's i guess makes him carry a lot more weight
that's probably well worth it then it probably be worth it just to do away with the cost of the elections and put it in the hands of maybe one man who can at least get his party together
so hum
um-hum
right
do you find it convenient to vote the actual time of day type where you have to go and the line you have to stand in
did you go early in the morning or
after work
hum that's interesting
well in my little district fortunately it is literally across the street i could walk over there as it were we live across from the school and so we
i drive out of my complex early in the morning and go over there usually before the polls even open and vote right at the you know number one or two sometimes the third or fourth person in line
and i wait longer to watch them set up than i do actually in the in the line itself but that gets me out of there at a time that i can go down central and not be bothered by the traffic as it were
because normally i'm at work before seven so just stay a little later that as it were and make the effort to vote
but unfortunately since there are so many other things that our city wants to vote on
they don't they tend to make the elections if it's a not important election as it were they only open a few of the poles
so i don't always i don't always vote at the same place so it's a little bit more trouble for me to well this election's going to be held this date and i've got to go over here
and i've got to remember you know on this election i'm in this district in this election i'm for here and you know this precinct votes here
and i would just assume in holding still and all vote in the same place as many times as they want
um-hum
um-hum
right
probably wouldn't even hurt to have a section that says here's how this particular office affected you or could have affected you over the last several years you know these are the kinds of decisions that this particular judge or this particular
railroad commission for instance does
if you know if he does do something or you pay attention to this or this is the guy to blame for this if you didn't like what happened
you are right there is no such deal other than the small publication that
league of women voters puts out it supplements that newspaper that i get a local newspaper they published but nothing per se in the major newspaper and as hungry as they are for things to print you'd think they'd want to do that
um-hum
right
that's true
hum well i hear someone calling me so i better let you go
sure
well
i am all for universal health insurance being up here in new york
our local blue cross blue shield people have
i'm now paying every month because i'm self-employed one hundred and three dollars a month
for basic health care coverage
actually i'm sorry it's more than well it's four hundred dollars a quarter
so it's probably a little more than that
and
frankly i don't i think that if we can take what's been done in canada and given every body a choice as far as who they want for their health care
frankly i think that the reason that we're in so much trouble and it's such an anticompetitive
stance right now as far as doing battle with these other companies is that we are really burdening our american corporations with health care costs which they have to build in to the price of their product
whereas if you go to one of these overseas countries japan for example where the government pays all of that
the you don't have to build that in to the cost of the product they usually nail the you know you pay as an individual
versus having a company dragged down by these insane health care costs
and i think that we should have a health care system in this country that everybody can get access to and have it universal
yeah i you know i wouldn't even mind so much if they had a corporation that is financed
through the government or have some sort of there can be competition as long as there is a universal plan i don't i do not i'm not for eliminating all private health insurance whatsoever
but you know but if you have the ability to pay
for that you can pay based on your income as a percentage
and more fairly and equitably distribute the cost across a wide spectrum right now
you know the people working this country is half the problem right there and we're seeing that's not a lot of it is private sector too
i you know it's the government is always attacked for not being able to do anything properly
this is one example i don't think the private sector's doing much better though
i get a credit this year and last year because the government specifically said i could get a credit
but the but it is it's going to expire which means i'm paying i get a sum a sum of the money back
but not all of it of course
i'm in a worst off position than someone who is employed who gets their health care taken care of by their employer
because i have to also obtain my insurance from is a third party middle man type deal
i have to go to go the small business service bureau and pay eighty dollars a year just for the right to buy health insurance
works well for them but it's horrible for me
yeah i
you just can't it's just it's sky rocketing i mean we're seeing increases every year ten to fifteen percent
um-hum
oh
oh that sounds great
some of the communities have started off with volunteer recycling one of the towns near here cambridge had a couple years worth of volunteer recycling i never saw it but
i know a fellow who was involved in the effort who said that it was amazing just hundreds or you know maybe even more than a thousand cars coming in on the one recycling day a month and they had dozens of volunteers sorting things
and when the volume reached a certain level the city's department of public works finally decided to do a curbside program
my town arlington
has had a similar volunteer program and they just got the department of public works to do a
a daily drop off at their yard where you know people can bring in glass and
and paper and whatnot and aluminum and tin and some of the other towns around here fact just about all the towns that border arlington where i live have gone to the curbside recycling and
i really wish we'd do it here it's just so much easier for people and i think it's it probably results in a larger volume of stuff being recycled if all you have to do is put it out by your curb once a week
as it is here i sort of resent the effort to you know collect everything until i have a chance to get down to the dpw yard and drop it off you know it's not a huge inconvenience but it's just one more thing to do
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
right
oh boy
really hate to hear that just regarding the newspapers the one curbside thing we do have in my town actually is every other week they'll pick up newspapers
which is nice and the rule is that anything that comes in the newspaper even the slick ad inserts they'll pick up and that's great
yeah
yeah i guess it depends on the facility it's going to the thing that i guess the flip side of that and
in our town anyway is that they won't pick up plastics now and even when they were here and in other towns around here they won't take the so called injection molded things which
i guess basically are containers that are bigger at the top than at the bottom like yogurt containers typically
and you know i don't know about dallas but i think people around boston eat a lot of yogurt so there's just a lot of lot of containers that wind up getting tossed you know without being recycled
and i don't know what's going on with in terms of capacity it's my impression although i haven't really read anything about it that
so many towns and cities have started recycling with there might not be enough firms out there
that are willing to take the or you know that'll pay decent money to take the materials
uh-huh
um-hum
oh that's great
well you know i think fireplaces are great but you know you really don't have to have wood
you know i mean fireplaces their great but you can get you know one hundred percent clean burning natural gas in your fireplaces and i mean you know most of the fireplaces are for ambience anyway they're not that efficient
there they really are but i live in a place where cars
maybe four out of a hundred will have more than one person in the car
so i'm a real proponent for mass transit there's just you know there's just no reason on a regular basis for someone having
you know to if we just did our mass transit better and longer and more complete you know
around the bay area here we got system here called i don't know if you've ever been to the bay area it's called
bart bay area rapid transit and they
connect berkeley with san francisco with oakland and
a couple of other cities but if it were to go to completely around the bay and when you ever you get on bart bart's just absolutely wonderful because it's fast it's clean it's really efficient and it's actually fun to ride
make the system so it goes completely throughout the bay area a lot of people ride bart but a lot more would
if and i think you know that alone that alone would just cut down so immensely on that we've also i mean the fact of the matter is that you know they've just got to find other fuels
and go other routes our i think basically our air pollution is one of the one of the
oh
one of main side effects or you know one of those visible symptoms of the us energy policy period and our energy policy is just nil just is nonexistent
and if we had one
you know striving to meet certain standards and certain goals and really to push it and let the corporations and the yeah you know the automobile manufactures and stuff it just keeps sliding
i think it would make a big difference it's just it you know it just hasn't hit people yet that we may have crossed the line
and that line being of you know a planet that's going to be able to continue to live or it's gradually already dying and it will not be renewable i mean we may have crossed that line
and it will be up to our kids and maybe their kids to you know
to find out
and things will live on this planet but humans may not be able to anymore
oh that that's terrible i mean that really is you know
yeah
yeah
sure
yep
well i mean it is a fact the cfc's do act like i mean it it's like a billiard ball you get a cfc up there high enough you know it's a it's in the ozone layer
it doesn't just breakdown one it's not a one to one reaction it's a catalytic thing and it actually just rumbles around and around and breaks up every c o you know o three molecule it hits
and i mean
whether it is the main contributor or not it's you know i think that no one can doubt the fact that it is
you know i mean it's a bad thing
it's a real bad thing and it's just you know i think it's so many of these bad things and some little really don't contribute that much and some just insignificantly but you know i heard something the other night that absolutely floored me
i'm a i'm a i'm a space enthusiast and just absolutely am absolutely crazy about the you know and think that we ought to put as much money as we can possibly get into the to the space program and i found out the other night
from an australian scientist one of the most respected scientist in australia
that every time
i the us shuttle goes up
it dumps more than what is it a hundred tons of these fluorocarbons into the ozone layer it is probably responsible our us shuttle
breaking down the ozone layer each flight could bring it down as much as one tenth
and it's the solid rocket propellants
parts of the system
if it were to be jettisoned lower you know before it got up that high
it really wouldn't have that great of effect but what happens is it goes all the way up through into the ozone layer and then it keeps firing and dumping and i just blew me away
yeah and it's frightening and a couple of these scientist down there have been screaming about this for some time now and of course australia is the one that's going to
you know suffer the most because that main whole that's over
the antarctica continent you know it expands out over australia and at certain times of the year
you know there's absolutely no ozone protection whatsoever in australia in the last in the years of the shuttle the skin cancer and other you know
cancers in australia have gone up you know something like six thousand percent
yeah they're so they're a little bit cross with the us and we could remodel that system you know
we don't have to use those as a matter of fact it wasn't designed that way initially at all the solid propellant rockets were a you know were time saving money saving afterthought
and i just you know i think it's just been
terrible anyway but that as an aside but there's another one of those things you know it's like so many of these little things
that add to it that i just think this country not only this country but the world has kind of started thinking
that if we don't get it together here
i like a wide variety like programmed into my car radio i have any everything from like soul
to like some easy listening i have the edge on there
new wave oh dallas
where are you from
um-hum
like new age
um-hum
um-hum
from new age well i was talking about like new wave or uh-huh um-hum
like peter murphy or
trying to think what else simple minds
um-hum
um-hum you probably know a lot more about music than i do i just listen to it while i'm driving basically i don't even have a stereo at the moment
so uh-huh
um-hum it's pretty hard
terrance
terence trent d'arby
just everybody yeah i like him except for his latest song cream i could live without
his latest song cream i could live without
but like purple rain i liked
huh
i like his old stuff
purple rain
i have that tape
um-hum
hum-um i don't think so
hm
hm
um-hum
um-hum
yeah he's always been kind of a pervert
which is weird because it's like on one hand he's so religious and then on the other hand he's such a big pervert you know kind of ironic
um-hum
um-hum that's true
um-hum
hm
um-hum
hm
um-hum
hm
hm
how old are you
how old are you
oh okay
hm
what's your major
oh
hm
hm
um-hum
oh neat
hm
how did you get into that
um-hum
um-hum
where where'd you go to school
hm
hm
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
neat
neat
um-hum oh it really doesn't matter to tell you the truth
yeah i consider myself a hacker how about you
yeah i'm not as good as i'd like to be but it's a
no i don't think so i started playing when i was in elementary school actually we lived really close to a par three golf course and i'd go up there with friends after school a couple times every week and then
for years i don't know after elementary school all through junior high and stuff i didn't play because i think i just got so frustrated when i was little i'd my body wasn't you know physically developed and all that kind of stuff and then i'd started picking it up again a couple of years back and i've really been enjoying it
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf
yeah
uh-huh
right
yeah i attend indiana university and it's the same way here they have a really nice championship style course that
is fairly reasonable to play on
a little bit but not a whole lot i mean i you'd think you would but you don't so i
well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty sixty dollars for a really nice course
uh-huh my dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town and i can play for free there and it's a pretty nice course
not me
right yeah
uh-huh what i really i had a chance they had the pga tournament up in indianapolis last year i was able to go and see one of the rounds of that and that was really fun
i mean you knew it yeah i never really thought it was would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch but man it was it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play
right
you got
i mean it's a lot more exciting than actually than watching it on tv and if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around i mean it's just
watching them the whole time instead of like on tv you get to see them make a tee shot and then they go off to some other hole and they come back when they're putting but you know it's really something else
i'm a student right now
yeah
at indiana university
i don't really know i'm a math computer science major right now
no i it'd be nice to be a pro golfer i mean it seems like that would be an okay life just to hang out and
yeah
huh
oh yeah
well you know you it seems like well you go to work every weekend play maybe one two tournaments a month and come in about tenth you'd still be doing pretty well
so
yeah
uh-huh
right
yeah
and those fees to join a club like a million dollars or whatever is just that is out of control
i mean you'd really want to really be liking your golf
yeah i saw one of those on tv that is pretty wild
yeah
that you were saying sorry
do you feel like you took the steps that you were glad that you took earlier i mean would you have done anything differently
that's wonderful i'm sort of beginning in that score we have a two year old daughter and hope to have another child soon so
it's not easy putting enough aside but we're doing a our best to try and have fairly regular meetings to discuss at least where our goals are sometimes
it is less consistent than it could be in terms of our ability to put money aside but
as advice
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um-hum
and the envelope is your savings
oh okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes yeah
that's been the case for us with cars and our preference recently has been used cars so it's been nice to be able to negotiate when you have cash when you're buying a car
well that's a that's a an important lesson do you feel like you've passed that along to your three kids given how different the economy's been in their lives
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i'm not really very much in favor of it at all i feel like the government gets involved in a little bit too much of our life anyway
and health insurance is one thing that i'm not sure that they have the expertise to
to run it anyway and i just i kind of feel like i say we've got too much government already
um-hum
yeah
are centralized type you know centralizing type of programs i have not seen one yet that i felt like really worked the way it should
i think that the private sector has a lot more expertise available and has the incentives to make a program work whereas a bureaucracy
people that work in a bureaucracy are just there to keep the bureaucracy going
so i'm
yeah well i guess like i said i don't really know that much about it i i've mine may be more prejudice than opinion you know i guess i've got
prejudice against the government you know
yeah
yeah i know that the british like i say i know i understand that the british system which is you know centralized medical program
does not work very well or at least the people are not real happy with it
and i that's my understanding anyway
and you know
yeah
yeah you know when you when you read see the some of the articles or watch in particular watch some of the british made television shows
you get the impression that it's more or less a joke you know a lot of people use it because they don't have an alternative an affordable alternative
but they're you know they still it doesn't work very well i know here in texas in the dallas area we have a county run hospital
you know the county furnishes the hospital and people that don't have access to insurance and stuff are able to go to that hospital
but if you go there if you're you know if you've got an emergency you have to be almost dead before you can get in you know in a timely manner because there are so many people sitting there waiting all the time
for medical services that you know if you may be there five or six hours you know for just normal treatment
well i guess to some extent an hmo i have been involved have been a member of an hmo before for a short period of time and that did work very well
but it was you know the it was a company sponsored plan and it is you know individual doctors that do own or have a you know have a shareholders in an hmo
to you know to run the program
and that might work but
at a government level by a bureaucratic type you know operation
i don't think it's going to work myself
i do think that we're headed that way i think that there's a strong possibility that in my lifetime i will see
in operation so
well i think i think that i think there
and i think the government
will respond you know to
when i say a lot of people i'm not saying a majority of people but i think the government will respond to that group that does want it
you know so
you know you know i guess i
i'm a i'm a pessimist in that in that respect
yeah
well i guess and perhaps mine too you know perhaps i need to know
yeah it was nice talking to you too okay thanks
bye
well fortunately my children are
it certainly is
yes our ymca has after school child care at several of the schools so that they don't even have to you know go anywhere yeah
and then for other schools that they don't have it at the school they have it at the y
and they pick them up in a you know a van or whatever i think it kind of depends on how many
students
oh okay
um-hum
um-hum well that's always nice too i did that when mine were littler
the first couple of years that i worked only halftime when my first child was born and he just stayed with a friend or somebody that maybe had one child you know his age
but always seemed to manage to find somebody that i thought was just as wonderful as the other one you know so it seemed to work out
and then and then went back
right unfortunately the preschool that i wanted the second one to go to because my first one had
is a preschool that does not have any day care at all but it's such a wonderful preschool so i had to find somebody else to keep them and then and then somebody to take them there
so that's always another problem
um-hum
um-hum
right yep
um-hum but then that's awfully expensive too
well i mean if so you have someone come into your home
you know that
that would be real nice but just almost cost prohibitive you know
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh that's good
um-hum
right
yeah that's true yeah that is true well how cold is it up there
i'm a librarian
um-hum yeah i liked that a lot and i kind of wanted to continue it even though my children were you know when they were born but like i said i was able to stay home for
those three years so it made a difference
um-hum
to get out yeah that's true i think
and everybody feels that way at times at least
and independent that's right
right well they've entered the work force more you know since world war two is when they started
right
yeah the you see more of that you see more of them leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too
right
no that i think should change will change in the near future also it's been changing it's been evolving but there's still a an
an unequality in the work force in certain jobs it's you know and you hear some people say you know well he's a man he needs that salary
right
and going yeah um-hum
right
yeah i think it will be i think i well another thing i read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much they're out there i guess is that car designers are starting to design cars with women in mind
because in the past the male bought the cars but now they're showing that fifty five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases
and that they are looking for
different things in the car the man is looking for the in the engine and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel
right
yeah we all do
i'm a nurse
and i work at medical treatment center which is at jupiter and arapaho
i don't know
i'm kind of out of out of things
right
well i i've lived overseas you know it's with in the army and i see what kind of taxes they pay in other countries
it just seems as if
from the time i've been following politics which was i guess about seventy five really got interested in politics and keeping up with it
it just seems since that time the bureaucratic machine has just gotten so out of control
and then they scream about that
that or the politicians scream about they're going to try and not raise taxes but they vote in a raise for themselves every year
i have trouble understanding the entire concept of foreign i understand going into countries where they've had natural disasters
and going in and giving relief aid that way
but paying for their these countries to run their own governments
i i've got a big hang-up with that
it just seems like they keep saying we're helping this country or we're helping that country out
wouldn't our money be better spent helping here at home
that's something i would and that subject in itself i'd love to see that entire thing revised
something's got to change
you know and turn drastically
well we've got
it's not like this country doesn't have the people with the knowledge we've got it
we've got people that are willing to make change
but as long as you've got career politicians that spend twenty five to forty five years in washington
playing power broker they're not going to do anything to tap out the well
now that's something i would love to see happen not only in all the states but in the federal legislatures too
two terms then they got to sit out one
and i think
the thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were elected to do it doesn't matter if they're in that office or not if they have to sit out a term fine they're going to be able to do things behind the scenes
either in the capacity of the lobbyist or in
working within their party of the state or national level to get things enacted
that's not going to slow them down at all
i think compared to the other systems that are out there without a doubt we've got probably the best system it just needs some fine tuning
well the question is who's ready to put their hand on the first wrench and tighten the first bolt
trying to get
the
politicians to actually truthfully
report what they did vote for what they didn't vote for when they were actually on the floor at their desk
is almost is going to be impossible to do
there is no accountability of them
at any given time if you've been to washington
okay
oh
okay well i've lived in the in the dallas and richardson area for about twenty five and a half years twenty six years
and we're in our second home now we've been in it for about thirteen fourteen years i think now in richardson
we've lived in the richardson area for that you know for the full time
well it's not really all that bad i think you live in plano so the plano area and the richardson area probably are about the same pricewise i would think
yeah so
yeah
yeah well
but then for the last several years it's pretty well stabilized and perhaps even dropped back some from what it was so
but we've done you know in order to maintain ours we've done some remodeling and stuff you know just to kind of change do some little changes occasionally so
but i guess i'm a little encouraged with home prices i i'm a cpa and i was just talking to one of my clients yesterday or you know over the last couple of days
and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know that was more reasonably priced it's in dallas but it's in the richardson school district
and the lady is very pleased you know she says it's got everything she you know thinks she'll ever want in a house and it was several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so
so i suppose that the housing market is you know it is on the on the down side right now
well i'm not really aware of those i do know that our house we've had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom replaced twice
because apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that
but that was a design problem because we put and we designed the house so it's our fault but we had them put the shower on a corner like our house is built in a u shape
and in inside that u but on one of the corners is where that shower is
and so any shifting in the foundation of course or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that shifting would cause some problems in that in that area of the house
and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of metal or plastic whichever it is anyway so
no it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and it's soaking up in the sheetrock or in things right
yeah but
yeah but i think you know i think so far as the location richardson plano are probably comparable the school districts are you know are about the same you know quality wise
yeah so
um-hum
yeah but well our house and i'm not sure how all of the you know how most of the builders do but ours is what they call post tensioned which means that there are iron bars you know that run through the foundation
and once they get the foundation poured then they apply tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete
and makes it more stable and puts more strength into it
so you know it
potentially that's supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the you know when the earth itself shifts around so
yeah so
um-hum
yeah
right is yours a is it a slab foundation or pier and beam
yeah so that's and that's what ours is our the house we had before was over we live on the east side of richardson now and the other one was over on the west side and it was a pier and beam house
and i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so
yeah so you know i think houses i think they hold up pretty well if you've got a if you have a good builder
yeah
okay
yeah so well it you know i think it's a good place to live or course if i didn't think that well we wouldn't still be living here so
right yeah that would
okay thank you
okay thank you too
the person i am i want to believe that it's an honest effort i want to believe that they really are trying to change that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society and i want to believe it's all okay
and never to this extent though you know so it's like there is a struggle within me going do i be open minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality you know i trust people i'll do that
yeah that it's not just or western society telling you it's it doesn't work
but it's still you know i guess i keep that one part of me that's like well
i don't know i want to trust them and i it's like i can't and maybe it's because you know we've had our own propaganda over the years i don't know
and they probably do the same things
you think the cia doesn't spy i'm sure they do
now the difference is we don't i don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe you know i think to that extent we don't go as far but i'm sure they lie
you know
so
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
you know i mean you know any country that wants to be democratic i'm all for helping them you know because i understand that you know you're looking at united states as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government
yeah we believe in what he's doing abroad but like you said there's issues here too
and i think it's moved in the right direction i now i think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight you know it's not going to it didn't happen here overnight and it didn't happen here without a struggle
you know
and i think sometimes we forget that
but i i'd i have to say yes i'm you know i'm encouraged by the way it's going
okay
well my kids watch it quite a bit i have teenagers and so no they watch
tv probably more than i would like for them to we watch really we watch vcr more than we watch tv but i'll tell you what show i don't like rather than what i do like
i don't like married with children
do you ever watch it
everybody says oh it's just supposed to be funny i don't find it funny i find it insult
which ones do you like
i love full house i think that's probably one of my favorite shows
yes they went through all
yeah it was really well done
yeah
and that she was i remember when it very first came out i remember watching the very first episode
and god they were all so young well you know the girl that plays dj cameron that's kirk cameron's sister do you ever watch growing pains
do you watch that
oh really huh that's interesting now i like growing pains
it used to be on well first it was on tuesdays and then they switched it to wednesdays and i hated that time frame because i had church choir and now it's on friday nights
no it's saturday nights
could be could be
i think i liked it when it first started better than i like it now yeah
no i've never watched it it's just
quantum leap
oh okay
ooh
but your daughter likes it
you like what
i don't watch it either
oh see i would probably like that too i enjoy things like that
oh
i understand
huh
when we're down to the last
time when you have to hang up because you've run out of time
no actually i'm still single
yeah but my mom she teaches at a child care center
yeah you've heard of kinder care
yeah it's a big chain she teaches up in up in the washington area
matter of fact it's a pretty big business
uh-huh
yeah they're growing really fast i remember i worked with a bunch of people for the summer and she was trying and one of the ladies there who drove me there she was trying to put her daughter in child care and it was the competition is pretty fierce you know
some places charge a lot of money and offer all sorts of amenities
some places are like really cheap but you know they like have a it's like a home or something an old home they just hire a bunch of people and have a big yard and let the kids play back there
yeah and
well she was she was looking for something cheap obviously someone to take care of her kid but that at the same time she didn't want you know some people that were like a bunch of teenagers you know
just out there working because some people do that they'll just go to high school or something get some kids who work for five dollars an hour and get them out there and that's all they really care about you know
but some places like they have they set up a gym you know like a jungle gym and they emphasize like athletics and stuff like that but those kinds of places get pretty expensive and it's really for the yuppies
um-hum
yeah
hum
yeah my that's what my mom you know thinks is the best way to do it you know if you know someone who's willing to take care of the person who's willing to take care of the kids that you know that you can trust
that's probably the best way to do it because sometimes you know i don't know if you saw the thing on some news i think on abc one time they was showing how people the some of the people were just smacking the kids around you know
um-hum
um-hum yeah
how many kids do you have
just one
yeah
um-hum
is it expensive up there
yeah it can get real expensive i remember i worked at a place in washington called intelsat
and the building also house wjla and they had a it was the child care facility was on one of the floors in the building
and they would charge i think the rate was eight hundred dollars a month for child care but the convenience was that the kid was in the same building as you were and it was a and
oh yeah but the child care facility was really top notch they had the where the kids were was i mean the right above it was an executive room for the wjla right below it was an executive room for wjla and it's all glass
so i mean there's really nothing they couldn't do they could do that you know that nobody could see you know so everything was pretty much under you know supervision
and since the building was built on a park on park land they had plenty of land to go out and just play around if they wanted to and
oh yeah i mean you can go visit your kids during the day you know and see how they're doing
yeah
hey it was a pleasure talking to you too take care bye
yeah well i think we may have the knowledge of the history but certainly not any understanding of the history
we seem to be you know doing the same we've done in many other cases which is sticking our noses in where it doesn't belong
and i think it's you know motivated
you know clearly by the fact of the resources that are controlled by the region which is
of the you know used up in the next twenty to fifty years there won't any oil left i'm sure
yeah
same problem as anywhere else anytime you take something away from somebody and give it to somebody else
basically a handful of nations took away from palestinians what was their homeland and gave it to the you know to the israelis
and you know it's not the way to go about any kind of
solution that's ever going to be workable you know i mean neither party was consulted up front
hum
yeah
well it's pretty scary anybody if you think about i mean any time you get fundamentalists you know whatever nature
and in power anywhere i mean they're pure fanatics and there's that you know fundamentally no way to deal with a fanatic
and you can't argue with them on any sort of logical or emotional basis
a fanatic will believe in x y z and you're never going to change that
you know so you might as well not even try
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah i think a lot of it is just rejection of the current
you know power structure and that power structure happens to be religiously aligned and aligned with you know a religious based monarchy in a lot of those countries
and that they're basically rejecting that power structure in favor of another which is you know return to a fundamentalist thing i mean it's not to unlike what happened in the united states
wasn't quite as severe or as you know fanatically radical i mean because the
the class structure is you know less
prolific here or less you know regionally defined here and
the differences aren't so strong as in say talking about like saudi we're you've got you know basically a ruling
i think you got it
um-hum
well it sounds like you have really strong views on it
and i can see that point but i also have this you know i
i question i guess i can look at it both ways and just to play devil's advocate
it never seems right to me that we take in people that are criminals and people that are you know
low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families
our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people and it just
that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes
um-hum
i agree with you there
um-hum
it
right
exactly
and then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs
you know we could be feeding poor people and helping you know
helping the environment i mean prison is such a waste of
a human being it doesn't do anyone any good yes people need to be punished and i do agree with your statement
that to take a human life is wrong
but you know locking someone up and not getting
you know any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too
um-hum
um-hum
oh exactly
that's right that's right
um-hum
we want a safe environment for ourselves and we want to remove them
but i think that the whole crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution
that is acceptable that does you know
basically you know i think you know that the whole idea of
a death penalty was invented for two reasons it -moves them from society
and number two it's kind of it's the punishment it's the ultimate punishment
because you know they've harmed someone and
you know you want to
appease the people that have suffered
but it
it really doesn't take their pain away
um-hum but it's a
exactly but that the pob the problem is so incredibly complex i have a friend who works on the pardon and patr paroles and she interviews
inmates all the time that are coming up for parole and she says it is just really frightening
how easy it is to you know have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded
and these people have not
benefited from the stay there she says
just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong
and there's not anything she can do to keep them in you know if they meet certain guidelines
you know and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work
so it's
um-hum
that's right
that's right
um-hum
i know i know i would like to see
the money that's been budgeted for new prisons
being put into the research of an alternate solutions to the problem
what power do we have
oh
um-hum
that's right
hum oh i know i know
but it sounds like you are you know interested in what's going on around you and
and you know when you have a voice you do
contribute and i guess that's you know what we're meant to do and maybe an opportunity will come by that
we will have a chance to make a real change
oh where do you work
oh you do
that's great
um-hum
exactly
right most of us are so sheltered you know
and a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what's out there
well that you're really performing a benefit to society in doing that
uh-huh
i i'm just i'm just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to
just to give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about
you want you want to you know persuade people to your viewpoint
and you're right that has got to be a challenge sometimes
right
um-hum
right
and you have to walk right down the middle with it
yeah
i'm sure
well that's that sounds interesting and i'll read your book some day
i enjoyed it thanks for calling bye-bye
my brother his name is ainsley and he was a conductor in new york city of a goldman band and they did park concerts at the lincoln center
during the summer season they were free concerts but he was with that group for like twenty one years and did both very traditional marches a lot of you know john phillips sousa and
all of and franco goldman in fact the name of the band was because
one of the famous march composers of all time richard franco goldman and his son edwin actually i may have those reversed father and son
started the band like seventy years ago i think so it's the oldest organization really of it's type in the country
and my brother became involved with them over twenty years ago as a manager and then ended up being both manager and conductor for quite a number of years
so
in that he also had one of the well actually there were two of the composers that he used were actually there at the performance also
so i got to meet them and in particular i got to go to the rehearsal before hand
and that was when i realized how good he really was at a rehearsal as opposed to an actually performance of working with the musicians
and one of his biggest struggles with the band was that this was all union musicians
which didn't give him a lot of leeway once they were in the band
he had a very difficult time replacing them no matter how they were performing at that particular season
and he ended up with some very unusual characters in that organization it was easy to tell that just from the rehearsal time
but anyway what were you going to tell me about your dad
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah i was in the band in high school and that
i played the clarinet
and ironically in college the marching band was part of the athletic department rather than the music department
oh
right
uh-huh
a tuba
right well does he bring the tuba home
oh my goodness
yeah just anything i have a niece that plays the harp
and she found the same thing that she had i think what they call a troubadour harp for a while and that she learned on and trained on but then
a harp became available which there just not very many instruments and a used harp became available in colorado and they lived in missouri at the time
and they actually drove to colorado to buy this instrument but they first had to go and buy a full sized
station wagon
so they'd have room to bring it home
and that's dictated their cars every since then just having one large enough for a full you know concert harp
that she plays
well i because of my brother's work with music for a long time he was a
a critic for the music journal
and as a result of that he
well that was part of the reason he ended up with this incredible classical album library or collection which i have now inherited
and
i don't listen to in nearly enough it's the same sort of thing there's so much music that i recognize but don't who is yeah who is the composer
but i've
based on just measuring number of inches or in this case feet of albums that i think i have about a two thousand album classical record collection now
if i wanted to at this point
but then it's hard to find a place to stack that much music
most of it is still in boxes stacked quite high in a back room
but
anyway
well he really did i know that he was a critic probably in the early sixties in new york city he had
we were thirteen and a half years apart i think and he left home at like sixteen to go to westminster choir college
and you know he did not finish high school he just went straight to westminster so i never really remember having lived at home with him
and after he did get out of college it was not long he
before he just moved to new york city knowing that that's where he had to live to quote unquote make it in the music world
and became a music critic and that probably puts us somewhere around the early sixties when he was doing that
i've seen that date a good bit on the on some of the albums because he would typically sign and date everything that
i think everything that he owned he did that with but certainly all of his albums and all of the music he had signed and dated
my goodness
you have one that's nineteen years older
my goodness
that is a wide spread
well we were at the opposite ends there were two sisters in between
but because he left home so early i think there was one summer i can remember him living at home and i was maybe six years old
i mean other than that i don't even ever remember living in the same house with him at all
well it was it was thrilling
my mother was with me at the time and it was ironically it was the first time that we'd seen him conduct that particular group which he'd been with so long
she had seen him fact she had seen him conduct in carnegie hall before
and i'm not sure it was probably the american symphony orchestra when leopold stokowlski was
conduct there at carnegie hall so she got to see him there and i didn't
oh sure well
i went to school at madison for two years and they're really big on women's rights and equal treatment
and so i seen a lot of like rallies and things like that but
i'm not that liberated i mean my mom's kind of old fashioned you know so i you know you pick up some traits from her and stuff but i think it's
i think it's interesting and
better for women to see that there's more of them doing men's fields i like to see that
and i don't like to see women you know like waiting on men hand and foot but you know i believe in like sharing and doing things for each other
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
right
um-hum
oh
oh yeah um-hum
right
yeah
um-hum
oh me too
yeah i like to see that i think it's
really neat to seeing all what educated minority person who really knows what they're talking about and
it's just too bad that some people you know still look down on them just because of their color you know especially black women
so
right
um-hum
right
right same here yeah
right same here
um-hum
yeah
yeah
exactly i see more men like participating in like the family things with children like you know helping to take care of them more and
and
doing the jobs equally yeah
oh yeah i agree with that
yeah at least she was strong enough to like try it and you know
so that's good
um-hum
oh
um-hum
uh-huh i think so too
oh wonderful so you travel a lot
uh-huh
sure
um-hum
oh that'll be fun too yes we went years ago we haven't been lately and i know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything but we used to have a lot of fun there
uh-huh
yeah if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping there isn't much there but that can be fun
um-hum
no i know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows
yes be excited about all of it
right
um-hum
sure
um-hum
and then get to pick and choose the places
ah
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
right it's kind of shaky
that's true it really is
um-hum our last big trip we drove through new mexico and colorado and went to the grand canyon and
back through silverton and durango and oh it was fun it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it our
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum oh there's too much to see really you just
homes yes sir um-hum
what are you settled in a place
right um-hum
okay
somewhere down in the duncanville and cedar hill area are you familiar that
yeah it is the kids are in school here in duncanville we're in a temporary place right now and so they've enjoyed the school so we're kind of trying to stay here but
well what the problem we got is that we've got five children
we look at the paper we look at our talk to our realtor and you can cut you know the listings in about a third and when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five are you looking or you settled i mean having finished
oh great
that empty nest syndrome is gonna set in i guess
great
okay
okay you are you from florida originally
yeah
oh yeah
i don't know if that's true but it's sure you know we're not anywhere near looking to cut down in size we're trying to find the
oh i don't think it's possible unless you know multimillionaire something like that yeah
oh yeah
yeah it is yeah we're having actually
if we find something for i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right you know that's but i think the thing's out there it's just a matter of
you know looking you know finding the right place
wow
oh yeah i think once we get into a place it'll be just fine but you know it's until then it's
oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing that's all
oh yeah maybe that's the case at least she's got more opinions you know there's
seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know
so what kind of business are you in
oh yeah great
we're with an organization called wycliffe bible translators it's a missions organization and doing translation linguistics that sort of thing
it's got an office down here in it near duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so
it
right
we were
really surprised to find that they're higher here
when we moved from louisiana to denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected and then to come down here we thought things would be lower and they're not
i guess
really prices for housing are just
hello
yes how you doing did you press one
oh guess we ought to get started i'm phil
i like i would like probably like i think i like the today show on the rare occasions i get to watch it i
yeah and i was gonna say i'll fly away which
i think it was supposed to catch some of the same viewers as
we've been trying to watch that it's not quite as good i guess you got to get into it
yeah it's about the civil rights struggle in the fifties
totally agree
well i say violence and horror i kind of lump them together
yeah
oh yeah that's fantastic isn't it that discovery channel it's
well i like watching the oilers and the
that's about it i guess i'll watch that's about the only sports i really like to get into on tv
yeah
well one of the good things is having cable they
they now you know the choices are so
oh yeah i think if my kids were small again we'd probably would too but
um-hum
yeah
it's kind of a
yeah
yeah well that's true and then course they have the pay-per-view but our channel system here in houston is not noted for being the greatest you know i think we kind of got the short end of the stick when
programming came around so
yeah they were teenagers huh
yeah
yeah
huh-uh
at least you're exercising a little
well we live in it's a single family home and i guess it
it's kind of well sort of big for the area and it's got four bedrooms and two and a half baths
and its on a color sack
how about yours
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
wow
huh
right
split level house
okay well ours is a ranch style and
we had a townhouse here we still have a townhouse which we are renting out so this is our first i guess single family home
and so we find that we have a lot to do to fix it up to the way we like it a lot of remodeling and all mostly cosmetic and we had a deck put in the back
and not run around the neighborhood
how much what
i think it was a quarter acre uh-huh
really that's a pretty big area
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay well what we have our family room when ah you know we bought it we noticed that it was really dark
and one of the things that it has in it is real dark paneling wooden paneling
and
it also has brown carpet and just kind of two small windows so what we are thinking of doing is changing the carpet to a lighter color and then we have heard that with the paneling you can wallpaper over it
or paint it and so that's what we are planning to do is to put a chair rail across the family room paint or wallpaper from the chair rail up and then
paint the chair rail on down in like a light blue color sort of i guess
williamsburg blue we are calling it but whether there's a color like that or not since we are near williamsburg but we are hoping that will lighten up the room a lot and make it give it you know give it a bigger appearance it has a fireplace in it too
and if that doesn't work we our next door neighbor is a roofer and he said he would help me put in a skylight so
we'll try that last resort if the painting does not help
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
what kind of carpeting do you have
uh-huh
oh okay
is it is it a real short or a thick carpet real short
okay because we were looking at something that people are we have seen advertised called i guess it's berber or something or berbar or something and we understand that that's supposed to be good for like a family room cause it's you know it wears really well and all that
right
um-hum
uh-huh
right
the other thing we are learning a lot about is we have a craw space under the house
everything like that
so as far as keeping the vents open and closed you know this is all new to us not having a house that had this before and
and keeping the vents open you know during when it's warm and summer and all that and i guess spring summer fall and i guess in the winter you close the vents and
and making sure that the rain the rain gutters from you know the roof and all
and things like that
so we were
uh-huh
uh-huh
a wood a wood burning stove is it in the middle of the room or against the wall
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
right
wow that's pretty neat
you know boundaries or whatever and we are sitting against the pointy end of the pie the house sits back and it so our front yard is actually the bigger yard and
just people were just renting it out and all that they a lot of weeds and all that have grown up
and so we have decided to get somebody for one year of service to help control the weeds and get it green again and then i will take over from there and so but i have to mow it at least once a week or else it looks bad
so
uh-huh
i agree
yeah
i know that i have three children and i stay home i don't work
and i know that it must be really challenging to try to juggle a job and also your children because i know my husband if i were gone as much as he is
we wouldn't have the influence on them that i would wanna put on them
and i also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to day care every day
they don't like to be around adults
they don't wanna play around adults they don't want to be around you they don't want you to tell them what to do they want to do their own thing and they're the very same age as my children
and i'm finding as i volunteer up at the school
i just a being i'm not educated at all in really detecting this but i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to day care and which kids stay home
and you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults
that the ones that are home and the ones even that are home that are getting the love and attention they need
not that the kids that go out aren't getting that it's just a different they're they are more used to being with their own age kids they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults
i think the trend in the united states i feel really bad that it's turned so much to where the children are
right
right
it's hard it really is hard i know that my husband and i have to do a lot of sacrificing to keep me home and
right
right i think one of the things that people look at too though is how they spend their time with their children
i think with working moms if you can get the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year round school where you work
okay so now what are your opinions on recycling
yeah
yeah i've heard that too
um-hum
well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them and i can't remember where i went to take them but they wouldn't take them
oh i know
there's no really recycling facilities
i think that's a good idea
besides well like a law or whatever and that's how it is in new york or isn't it
um-hum you get ticketed if you don't do it right
yeah
plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment
um-hum
yeah
so that way that kind of forces you to recycle
yeah that's true
yeah i've seen them
um-hum
that take them back
is texas one of them
yeah
no i don't think that there's enough being done now i work at jc penney at their corporate headquarters and we have a paper recycling
program that's company wide and i do the recycling for that
yeah
yeah i know there's a lot of computer paper though that you can't use
but we use to have i mean i don't even remember how much money that they've i mean the money that they've made from the recycling program they've donated it to charities but i mean they've made a substantial amount of money from it
yeah
yeah
well now you see some of this stuff and you're and then when they come out with the new things you are like well why didn't you think of that before
yeah that's true
yeah
do they not ever i mean i don't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like
then that's pollution
yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor
yeah
truly sad
all right
yeah
well i guess
i i'm kind of in an unusual situation probably for this particular topic because i'm self-employed
but yes i have worked i've worked for ti and i've worked for ltv
and i suppose that
so far as benefits are concerned the most important
to me today would probably be something to do with retirement benefits
at this point in my life though i'm a little older probably than you know than the typical new employee would be anyway
in you know in my younger days i was interested in what's the vacation policy
and then as i matured a little bit you know i was more interested in what are the insurance benefits you know
but so i you know i guess it from my point of view it depends on
you know on
where you are in life as to what's most important
and
yeah
yeah you know if you're not if you haven't looked forward to you know what are you going to do when you retire
when you get to the point where you're looking forward to it then it gets to be important because you've got to do some planning for it you know especially if the company is not doing it for you
and
there are you know there are companies that do and there companies that don't you know that don't have good retirement plans
i guess the companies that participate in the 401k type plans where you know you have the option of contributing to a retirement plan
and maybe even the company does some kind of a matching program for that that's those are good programs
i i'm a cpa so i look at you know i get to see a lot of these a lot of different programs and things and along that line
and i like to see where the company makes those makes benefits available at least to the employees
so that they can pick and chose what they like
you know there they've got one that they call a cafeteria plan i don't know whether you're familiar with that or not
and essentially the cafeteria plans are programs where
the company makes available a different packages of benefits you know you can pick the kind of insurance you want and the kind of dental coverage and the kind of vacation policy you want an
and all of these different things and you pick the ones that you want as long as the total cost to the company essentially the total cost to the company
fits you know within their guidelines so every employee gets the same dollar amount of benefits
but they can pick them from different whatever is most important to them
so you can so you can get you know you can get the insurance plan that's important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan that's important to them
and the company winds up paying the same you know the same amount for each one
i believe that you can that you can change well maybe not from year to year but at least you can change periodically
as to you know as to get the stuff that's more important to you yeah that's something that the that the federal government you know put into you know into the irs regulations as
deductions allowable deductions for companies they put those in oh four of five years ago you know the different insurance companies and things started promoting those plans
and i think there you know it's a pretty good option to have
of course the 401k is a good you know it's a good savings vehicle
so
anyway
what kind of plans are you are you in now are what have you been in before
well as so far as benefit packages in total
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i understand that yeah
yeah so
right yeah it's and it's it it's a hassle trying to
put your money all in the right in the you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it
you know to get everything do you have children and so they i guess the
yeah the yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important if you had if you had children i guess if you're of child bearing age then it's important too you know because
you know because you got to have at least have the coverage in case that your in case you have another child or have a child
and
you want to have that coverage
so anyway
but what else
yeah i guess what kind of typical vacation
programs vacation plans do the companies have that you've worked for
so far as when you get vacation and how much
uh-huh
yeah it's i have not i have not seen vacation policies you know written in about seven years so i'm not real sure how they're how they're changing what they're doing now
yeah
yeah
yeah but yeah that's a good deal
yeah how what do you what do you find that they're when they change from two weeks to three weeks is it five years or ten years or
yeah
yeah
oh is that yours okay well and it's been nice talking to you
okay thanks
i used to sail quite a bit when i was younger and i haven't sailed much recently but i do like it i do like it how about yourself
uh-huh
yeah
how old were you at that time
uh-huh
wow
what's it like sailing on the gulf in corpus
is it pretty rough
oh wow
that's something
forty two foot boat is probably quite a -vestment
i don't know if it's a matter of the speed or if it's just the fact that you have a little bit more control
at the tiller than you do say if you're in a power boat
almost seems like it would be slightly boring
uh-huh
yes
more of a challenge
um-hum
beautiful clear water down there i'm sure
that's wonderful
oh where you're standing like a surf board only there's a
uh-huh
i almost tried that once with a on a club med vacation
but they had these other flat they weren't flat actually they were
probably eight to ten foot little skiffs that were a lot more fun so i went where my experience was
uh-huh
it looks challenging physically challenging
uh-huh
uh-huh have you ever surfed
that might be the same sort of muscles that you'd use but
it wouldn't be as difficult as it might be for some other people
uh-huh
have you ever considered either buying in with someone else a partnership in a boat or
i see
yeah
yeah that's a trade off certainly
there we go
well actually i'm a i'm a dodgers fan from way back
what's that
yep
is that right
that's interesting
yeah i also lived eight years in ohio before going to going away to college
and i used to go watch the toledo mud hens
really
i couldn't tell you for sure it's been a long time
uh-huh
yeah i think that's right
yep
well that's true i've kind of become a rangers fan over the last eleven years since i've been here
i don't either i mean the guy's twenty five home runs maybe thirty eighty some rbis
really i mean he really has become a very decent fielder
yeah he he's not a the liability that he was that he used to be
yeah of course you know get a guy like cecil fielder you know if he strikes out a lot so what
oh yeah
right
yep
well i think the key for la this year is whether orel hershiser can come back
it may be
right well picking up darrell strawberry didn't hurt
who was the last one
oh okay
yes he is
yeah
yep
well it should be an interesting year
are you are you an orioles fan
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah you know i kind of wish that they had interleague play like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the national league teams here once in a while
three hundred miles
yeah it is it's incredible
there you go
boy you are a baseball fan aren't you
interesting
wow
all right
yeah so do it while you can
sure well it's been good talking with you sure enjoyed it
i wouldn't mind
yeah well god bless and good talking with you
bye-bye
i
they called
last night i think somebody tried to call i had got food poisoning saturday night and i was spent the early hours of the morning and most of the day sunday in the emergency room and i had just gotten home last night
and the answering machine must have gotten it because it just gets the last little bit of the you know the computer talking
yes i had i was sick anyway and then i had to work most of the week and it really ran me down so the weekend i was going to try to you know recuperate
and then on top of that i had i got food poisoning i couldn't believe it i was like what did i do push the self destruct button here or something
i couldn't believe it was just miserable
yeah exactly i mean because it's been saltine crackers and 7-up for three two days
yeah i worked today i just you know there working towards year end there's just so much going on that you can't afford to be gone you know
so it's really kind of wild
sure
okay
let's see the only kinds i've ever done are just regular you know fishing in the lake or i have actually fished for brook trout in colorado but
yeah i that's i that's what i hear is you know that you it's not too bad if you can put like eight people on a boat then it comes down to not being so expensive
but i also found out some more about it and i'm not sure i would enjoy it i don't know that i would really like you know fighting with a fish for
hours
yeah i
yeah
in fact that's the most successful i have ever i mean as far as ever catching a big fish that's how i caught one with
a bass it was a well see i can't remember if it weighed three and a half pounds or
five pounds or
i mean it was you know big i mean it was biggest fish i've ever caught in my life you know
i was so excited you know i was like screaming my father was running you know he saw the fish go flying through the air
that part of it was kind of
i don't know
i was fishing with a little light reight weight rod and we'd been fishing down behind there's a place on the back side of this dam of this little lake that we it's a little private lake that we water ski on a lot and
and they have the water they let water drain off the back side of the dam through just kind of a
i don't know it's some kind of a little drain shaft or something and it makes a pool and then it goes on down the little creek that they dammed up to make the lake in the first place and they were there's a little pond kind of a
pool of water there that is pretty turbulent and it's usually pretty good fishing and mom and dad were fishing in there and something kept eating my minnows you know and i was getting real ticked off because i couldn't you know i wasn't catching anything
so i crossed the little road that crosses the stream and went stomping down through the woods and where the creek runs on out there's a big old tree uprooted and laid over lengthwise in the water and i
thought to myself you know i mean this creek is about five feet across max and i thought you know
i bet you at the end of those roots there might be something and so i had my little you know i couldn't cast because the tree's hanging over and brush and everything so i just kind of
held the bobber in my hand and flipped it out there in and amongst the tree roots
and it kind of went around in a circle and then it kind of went right below the water and then it went around and then it just went whom out of sight altogether so i started reeling you know and it was stripping my line
as i started going i realized i had something bigger than i was equipped for because i had one of these little ultra light you know kind of casting rods and i was like oh man so i was reeling for all i was worth and pulling you know pulling on the line
do you work for a large corporation
uh-huh
it would be nice but
that would be nice
well people with families have different objectives than single people or no i've got a family two children
yeah
alright do you have children are you single
you are i
oh you never have
oh yeah that's there's still a lot of time for that i had already been married and had one child by that time but
it has worked out so he's got a real nice benefit package
but
it's nice to be with a big company for that reason i guess
oh the hospitalization
i think it's three fifty a year for the family
whereas with my company they pay fifty percent and the deductible's i think five hundred a year
and it costs a lot more i'm with a smaller company though
so
that's right
yeah it's not very good
yeah
yeah or you can go with a hmo you know health maintenance organization where you pay a certain amount a month
and then five dollars every time that you go in or two dollars everytime yeah co-payments that's what they are
um-hum
um-hum
well if we one of our children is just is just turned two and her first
eighteen months of life god well she had one operation she's been to the emergency room a couple of times i mean she's just expensive the other one wasn't nearly that expensive but the but the baby just one of those
yeah my husband's got that available that's great
i'm not exactly sure
yeah that's great
yeah it it's nice we do a lot of our savings in that manner and then the rest of it through a universal life policy which is
money that you can touch but it's tax deferred and yields a higher rate in general than what we can get in cd's and gets life it's a it's a term life policy also
uh-huh
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
until you get your dependents it just doesn't matter
yeah right
right
but as far as being able to really leave anything
are your
oh
i've never
yeah
i've
my husband's company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesn't and
it's not part of what's available so
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
so have you have you been just been out of school what i guess four years yeah
yeah
at
they had curbside recycling and it was very
put everything out there but we don't have it in at least in our neighborhood right now
and so i've been very guilty about not making the effort to take things where they belong
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
where do you take those things
uh-huh
where do you do that because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir but i didn't know where to take them
oh
yeah
better than nothing right
oh
right
right
yeah it was real easy with the bins it really was and it was just no effort at all no more trouble than taking out the garbage so i
right
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
so it's gone down yeah
right yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right i don't have any excuse then that's for sure
okay bye-bye
um-hum
all right
or dye community
yeah i mean i'm out in i'm out in the wilderness literally
and well give you an idea it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete i mean to the asphalt we're out there
i'm building our house right now and i'm going to incorporate into my garage area a weight activated crusher
so when i drive the car in the in the driveway in the afternoon it it'll just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the pressure side of a hydraulic cylinder
and the weight of the car will crush what's ever in the disposer
well i thought i'd you know i'd use it as a escapement type thing i don't know if you're familiar with that operation but what you do is you just build up the pressure
and then you go over and release it and then it just it just drops you know
very similar yeah
well what it'll be you just you drive up on the jack but you it won't go down
until you pull the pin yeah
you know all that junk mail you get
the glossy paper that says buy this and send off for that and you have won and all that well anytime they send me a return envelope
i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i you know happen to gather up
because well like i say we live away and when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard and i don't like that so i don't do that so i take it and i send and i mail it back to them
yeah well i think one of the best ways to eliminate or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non-reusable items
for instance i saw a thing on nova think was the other day this guy has designed
recyclable materials i mean recyclable items whatever he makes it's all out of the same thing
see so if it's plastic it's all out of plastic if it's metal it's all out of metal it's he's a design he's a engineer designing stuff
and incorporating you know reusable materials into your
you know your assembly line into your actual scheme of
product operations is the only way to really do it on a on a broad scale make it financially attractive to recycle and somebody will find a way to make money at it
well there is a guy in dallas that's all he does
he collects trash
you know
yeah well he's out for cardboard
um-hum
um-hum
so do you say you work for a temporary but do you work full time hours doing that
um-hum they
but do they determine your benefits on whether or not you do work those hours or
then they adjust it accordingly
my husband works for a large oil company and
they and in the past has worked for a computer company and a bank so we've always
always had access to good
benefits as far as insurance and usually some dental and
life insurance and that kind of thing you know and
yeah exactly
i know here sometime back you know they had given him a printout you know of
money that the company had paid into stock in his name and how much he'd paid and
the medical benefits and whatnot that he was entitled to and they estimated those benefits at about forty percent of his salary
even including vacation like you said and paid holidays and
and all of those things now some of those you look at and you say well i'm not going to need that or use that benefit but i guess it's there knowing that it could be used if you
so chose
yeah
yeah i we've always been dealt fairly with that way
and i would certainly you know
caution any young person going into you know looking at jobs to make sure that they truly know what those benefits are and
how they're going to match up and it might be wise to take a lower salary or hourly wage
if you knew that long term the
you were going to get more of a profit sharing or you know or just you know
whatever you know the differences in the
you know in the benefits we belong to an hmo through my husband's work is do you is that the kind of medical
you have
um-hum
well we
we have five children so it's been good for us to have the hmo for the most part
we're in a different one now than we used to be and it's required some adjustment but i think it in the end it will all come out in the wash their mental health benefits are very low
and anything that is elective of in any way could possibly be conceived as elective is you know not covered so
if you have those kinds of services that while the general public may see them as elective you don't see them as elective
then
you know
you know you may not get the coverage that's you might have
uh-huh
that's right that's right
and i know that is a is a concern and if those people aren't willing to
go to outpatient you know therapy or something then that benefit is
what was paid is almost wasted
and well i mean i guess you can't ever totally say that but
you know the best good was not gleaned from the money spent where as maybe even two weeks longer would have made a difference there should be some provision for appeal or something i guess
need
well yes i guess so you know
but not really
you know there're there are some options in every area whether it's medical or you know insurance or you know as a stock you know savings
kind of plan that's subsidized by the company and that kind of thing so
um-hum yeah
yeah we have been so grateful for that over the years because we
that that's what our kids are going to go to college on i guess so
you know it's good that
no i don't think so i think there're going to be too many of us our age for any way that system can possibly
even barely lessen the load we just better be those of us who can try to do something anything to put away for
hopefully we won't have such a attitude
in our country about elderly people not being able to work and not being smart enough to
lend a hand by the time we get there too
yeah
exactly so it's going to we're going to see a lot of changes in the next while
i would think so don't you think yeah
i know my mother-in-law has had to get individual insurance the last couple of years and she's seventy two
and it's just been so difficult to get you know to get anything
but
yeah uh-huh
like that so
but
you know i would say that overall we've been very luck and are very happy you know if i had to
you know
um-hum
yeah i work for part-time for a man who's self-employed
and gosh you know he and his he doesn't do anything for me you know because i have what i need through my husband but it sure is rough for him it's providing for his family
oh i know it
yeah
but you never know if you could have had that catastrophic thing happen to you know you or your baby where you'd need
need somebody to jump in and take over those payments
yeah it sure is well i appreciate getting to visit with you
take care bye now
oh gee the first one that comes to my mind is
camping outside the river at the at new braunfels there
yeah we've gone down there many a year
camping
riding the river rapids
yeah well they have some you know half way decent rapids there too
oh really
yeah
i never tried that
well i we've done quite a bit of camping we used to
throw everything in we had some old volkswagen buses in our early days when we had kids and they
you know go drive up into the hill country around
oh new braunfels and
san marcus around in through there
austin up around austin area
just camp out
yeah usually we'd go like the state parks a lot of the state parks up in through there
i had fixed up the thing where you could just open up the doors i'd hooked on a little extension and
and then we were set up in about five minutes ten minutes
out by the side of the river
yeah
then we later on we started using a tent when we'd go to you know tent camping
we enjoyed it we had three kids and
they've done a lot of camping with us and
they just seemed to like it
um-hum
ha
that's my one of my wife's favorite stories to tell about easter camping trips it the coldest easter ever
we left here we left here it was shorts weather in on easter and
we went up and
we didn't of course weren't prepared for it so
we sat there my brother-in-law cooked chicken bless and he was don't know how in heck he managed to do it but he did he stood out there and cooked that and we had something hot to eat
we got up the next morning and she said i don't know about you
she said i'm going into town and we're going to buy some long johns
so i was ready
i was ready to go back to houston
yeah that's
sometimes turns into fun i think another similar one was when we'd go
up to bastrop strate state park there in
kind of got caught by the cold weather and
we gathered what firewood we could and built us a campfire you know and sat around there
so we each took turns going out and gathering up big bundles of pine needles and throwing them on the fire and they didn't last very long but they burned hot
i remember that was a lot of fun
i we had we've used a tent you know pop up trailer
we've done some camping in that we still go down to the river at least try to get down there once a year
braunfels
yeah uh-huh
they're some
they're some they're some what you'd call primitive i mean there are no
there's a few that have hot and cold you know electricity and hot water and so forth
there's a few of those and you have to make your reservations pretty well in advance
yeah because it's you know it is so nice and there limited space so
we usually if we're going we usually try and make them by march or so anyway
so
it's pretty nice
well if you want to get a good camp site yeah you can go down and get a camp site pretty near any weekend they get pretty crowded on the you know the main july fourth of july and
yeah and labor day
yeah
we try not to go before july because it takes
gets warmed up yeah it comes out of the
canyon lake up there and it's
comes out of that deep lake and it's pretty cold water you know
um-hum
yeah
well in addition to
to the river what we call it's the guadalupe river it's
downtown new braunfels
and then they have the what they call the shoot which is
right through the downtown part of new braunfels
that's a lot of fun
yeah um-hum at
camp warnicke
right in yeah right in almost right in downtown
especially if you've got kids
they have tube ride tube shoots and just and so many rides you can't almost can't do them all in a day you know
yeah it's a
all day event
yeah
yeah well
i'm
you too
bye
first how much television watching do you do
uh-huh
that's right but do you actually watch it and pay attention to it or is it more of a company
um-hum
um-hum okay
right
well actually i work full time and when i'm not working i'm running and i don't watch a lot of television and i'm very selective in what i watch if there's something that i absolutely
want to watch i will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off i probably watch television four hours a week
max and if i don't find something that i really want or really want to watch well then i just do not turn it on i would rather listen to music
part of it is that i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and i think that if we're doing other things and these programs come in
sometimes they influence us and we don't know where that influence came from
yeah
right of course i
that's right
i
well last night for example i really would've liked to have watched unsolved mysteries those are fascinating to me if i have the opportunity i watch it unfortunately i was with someone else who was flipping channels i hate that
in our comedy programs although nobody can appreciate comedy any more than i can but i would prefer to find a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians
uh-huh
that's right and some of those are fine programs uh-huh
uh-huh i enjoy comedy um-hum
um-hum
um-hum i enjoy that um-hum
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
um-hum
right
well
yeah i watch it for entertainment but i also watch it for cultural impact i do a lot of channel thirteen channel three some of the educational channels and i watch for special programs that have special
a special play a special concert i recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars
makes chills all over you
so i may or may not even look at the tv guide but if i have time i may flip through and say hey
this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour if the hour comes and i don't get a chance to watch it so what
um-hum
um-hum
i do too it makes me want to cook and then i eat and then i get fat so i just let other people watch when i eat what they cook
oh i think that's marvelous yeah oh yeah i took a lot of my college courses i took some of my college courses on television so that it's very successful for some of those things but i think i really got stung very badly
about having influence in your life or at least i've i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life
my husband had an aunt who was addicted to the soaps and i want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old woman that ever was i mean she
absolutely i don't know who she thought she was but she just got to the point where you could might near you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice and that attitude being demonstrated
and for her to miss a soap was a big withdrawal and
well i don't know well she was grumpy to begin with there's no doubt about that but
but you could clearly see those influences and in my youngsters i know that one day my youngsters were watching the three stooges and i always thought that was just casual slap stick comedy
but when one tried to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench i decided that wasn't funny anymore
and i really i really feel very strong about the bart simpson show i think that is the kids watch that and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid that i ever saw and i just i do not like it
um-hum
um-hum yeah
well i was very careful even when my kids were kids were at home and when they were young i really did
watch what they watched i was i sat down with them and i watched it and if i did not like it i changed the channel for them you know i you know i distracted them changed their interest
because i just couldn't tolerate that kind of influence on my kiddos it just
sure that's right that's right gosh they got they're mouthy enough anyway
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well
um-hum
um-hum
sure i can understand how that would happen
and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company so i'd go out with them now see there's the problem parents don't do that they say you go outside and play
yeah i said but we went on field trips and we did other things and i think that was
of course
what
state college i go to penn state
yep
right exactly
i see well what particularly are you interested in
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
i see
well some of both i
read magazines and such
well yeah i mean not that badly anyway so i am i am interested in what's going on
and i'm particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about haiti recently because i've been down there
and yeah
right exactly
yep
um-hum
that's true they've never really had a good leader
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah
um-hum
i see
um-hum
yeah so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in america
um-hum
yep
oh yeah
i don't know
right i think that
well that may be so yeah i think that i'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into how deep they dig into the things and such
right
um-hum
okay what do you feel are some of the main problems
um-hum
yeah
it it's pretty bad here too we've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff and in durham which is right next to raleigh
yeah that durham raleigh and chapel hill is the triangle
right
yeah it's really it's and i've seen in more in durham than i have in raleigh or
or chapel hill chapel hill is kind of a ritzy
city or whatever i mean it's kind of
i'm sure there's problems with it but it has a pretty low crime rate compare compared to durham has probably got the worst
they've had like forty eight murders since the beginning of the year and over half of it's been drug related
yeah
yeah
well that and the and the economy's so bad and
and so many people have been laid off and stuff they've done special stories on the news local news here we've had a lot of bank robberies and different lot of break-ins and stuff
i know like a week or so ago
i live in a in a town house which is you know it's a pretty nice neighborhood
and this lady was going to work she came home and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything and
i would say so for the majority in our in my little section of the neighborhood because
i'm probably the one of the youngest people that live over here most people are retired or
or you know they're in their forties or whatever so
and i'm in my twenties so i i'm out more than they are but they're at home at night so i really don't worry about anything
yeah
yeah see that's the same thing here
yeah
yeah
no i just kind of i
i kind of watch them on the news and that's about it
the michael jordan's on chicago bulls isn't he
what did he get hurt last night or
oh okay
um-hum
oh yeah
no i kind of feel like the about the mavericks the way i do about the cowboys now
yeah just all this roy tarpley stuff and
and what is it their you know he got he's in trouble again down in houston and they said the other night his contract is so big
that if anything happens to him you know if they don't trade him they'll have to pay him off
you know so they're rather have him
except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon and have some chance of him playing you know earning his money
yeah
sure is
yeah
oh yeah
they're consistent
um-hum
yeah well they play better as a team than anybody else seems like
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah and year in and year out it's not like they have you know
a lot of teams will win the play-offs and then the next year they'll be all they'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff to
to concentrate on the game
yeah except larry bird's hurt
his back is bad all the time now i think
yeah they play two or three times a week
like you know and then they go on road trips and they do the same thing and then they and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time
so
it really gets you know the i mean they're sleeping in different bed every night and
and i imagine that really helps his back
uh-huh
yeah he said he said the other night on the news that he hadn't done any extra shooting for six weeks so you know and he's the one that's always winning the
the
the outside the three point shot and the
he does that every year
uh-huh
yeah
not much just
just playing horse and stuff like that
yeah because it's it kind of a violent game
and
and they
yeah and they don't wear any pads so i
i figured
yeah they have to wear goggles because they get hit in the in the face with elbows all the time
well it's his it's i was looking in the paper for something on it and here's the top nba draft prospects
and
i mean they're all the size of football players you know
except they're just taller
uh-huh
six foot yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah really
oh yeah
well here's a here's a guy from lsu stanley roberts he's seven feet tall and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds
so
yeah
um-hum
it doesn't even say it doesn't say here it says
it says the this is for underclassmen for june twenty six
and i guess i guess they don't they have a lottery on it
they pick numbers
and that's how they take them in order
it must not be according to their how they did during the year
um-hum
um-hum
and
utah portland boston and detroit
okay that's the nba yeah
i think boston will win
yeah
um-hum
oh no
um-hum
yes my mother was in a nursing home for five years before she passed away in nineteen seventy seven
it was a fair nursing home
it was a matter she reached the point where she couldn't stay by herself during the daytime she and my sister who never married lived together
and my sister couldn't retire at the time so my mother's physician recommended that she go into a nursing home
and fortunately my sister was able to go visit her twice a day
and
she just reached the point where she had to have professional care she was eighty two at the time
yeah
well
i don't think she ever really adjusted
my mother was very shy she never joined anything
and she realized that it was something that had to be done
but she had begun to lose a great deal of her memory capacity at the time
and finally about
oh say about a year before she died my sister was the only person that she ever really recognized and could call by name
no
oh several years before well it's a long thirty minute story but when my father died in nineteen fifty eight i transferred the title to my sister
which was an internal family deal i knew that if something happened and my sister couldn't take care of her i would
but
we had fixed it for her
oh many years before she went into the nursing home like about fifteen so that she had no assets so as it turned out medicaid paid for all of it
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
my other sister
who was married at the time and was still working
worked for several years in a nursing home and she said roughly half
of the people don't have anybody
and nobody ever comes to see them
yeah that's too bad
well let's face it there for the most part well
there's one exception that i'll tell you about in a minute for the most part they're profit centers
but my sister who looked after my mother
let's see
she died in ninety so this would have been the first of the year in nineteen eighty nine she made
that's true
yes we do
we have the death by lethal by injection
i'm sure that
created or committed murders etcetera that have not been put to death even though they were sentenced to death row like look at charles manson i mean he just happened to have the right timing
huh-uh
i don't think that i could sit on a jury and be part of sentencing someone to death
i would find that too difficult
um-hum
correct
something that's taught
um-hum
i don't think it's a deterrent at all i don't think that anyone that commits a murder actually thinks that they will ever
even be punished let alone put to death for it
most people who murder someone don't even get caught let alone prosecuted to the to the extent of the law
right
right i think for possibly the premeditated murders i think it's possibly a deterrent but
for the for the gang violence the street murders so to speak i don't think it is
not where i live but i live outside of dallas
the san antonio has much more gang violence than dallas does have an area of town however the
frequently the county hospital that handles all the gunshot wounds here
handles fifteen gunshot wounds a day
i mean a day
yeah it obviously is not a dc you know
it i understand that vermont's relatively calm
um-hum
goodness
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah yes they're the they're the victims of neglect and
and many years of
of perpetuated
nonconcern for human life
yeah it's just a lack of concern they don't have you know these kids
the ones that are involved in you know gangs i think are searching for self-esteem and they find something like that in their gang activities
and they never had this at home and their parents don't have it if they happen to know their parents
the other
yeah the we were shocked two mornings ago with the news that a forty year old man had sold his three year old son
for forty dollars worth of crack
and they found the boy and the boy had been unharmed but they were trying to sell him you know they were trying to sell the baby or the boy and he's three years old they were trying to sell him on the black market
i mean it can you that just repulsed me and it repulsed everybody that i work with i mean it you know we
but it's real strange it's a world that
is the drugs are the drugs are going to get us all i mean drugs
actually i think we're doing capital punishment to the wrong people i think we ought to have capital punishment for the true importers of drugs
not the kids that are selling it on the street that don't know any better i'm talking about the people you know who are bringing it to our country i think they deserve capital punishment because they kill
they kill a lot
yeah
that's true
all right
benefits
yes i do i work for the school system richardson school
yes it is and retirement's one of the good benefits
and health care has been a mess
and that can be with a large corporation it used to be but i think that's a mess for everybody now isn't it pretty much
it keeps i
yes for the best where it used to be one of your you know you got the whole package with your larger companies and you didn't have that problem
yes i think i do i've never worked for a small one so i can't tell you know but yes i believe the benefits and the pay is much better than you would get in a smaller system
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
right we do have very good resources they're excellent
and they're
well it's an important aspect of it i feel you know it is it is an important aspect
as far as
being having everything available to you
the counseling and the whole
um-hum
right
well probably the major one would be the medical
i would like to see a better package for the money you know but i guess we all would and they keep cutting us from the you know they keep cutting from the
medical into the dental is so expensive where we used to get it and you used to get the eyes and the whole thing and you don't get any of that any more you know it's all separate and it's all so very high if you do get it
and that's very frustrating and it i can't imagine how the younger families do it
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum i was just going to say the retirement is fair for teachers but my husband has retirement too and it's not good though we've had to i mean we're building our own you know
you have to any more you can't count on companies on that any more that and that's another thing that's changed the medical and the
retirement benefits from large corporations it's kind of it's like it was set you know you were really set for life really
uh-huh
yeah yep that's right before
my mother talking in the forties for her father was cut you know they went through this same thing in the forties that they're doing now they were cutting men at forty five and fifty years old and that's what they're doing again it's like a recycle of the whole
when they see they're gonna have to pay all those benefits and all or it's getting close to a time
they bring in they bring in the younger blood that they don't have to pay as high and
i do too and the wisdom behind it all it's yeah and you know that's got to that's got to add in all their production the whole works
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well it's cost again
you know cutting
how did you all get tied up with this ti system
yeah i just dial one
yeah
yeah but what did you are you with tier or how did you get tied up with this
i guess a typical home here is without a basement i guess that's the classical
yeah we have something here we have something here you may not have up there which is a well we were phasing them out is the wood shingle roof i don't know if you had it when i first got here
from new jersey
right no i i'm my accent's gone i've practiced a long time to get rid of it
the wood shingle roofs are phasing out here they're very they're good for air-conditioning you know they
it's you it's very shocking when you look inside the attic and on a dry day
and see a hundred little or thousands of little light wholes you know
it it's very strange and then when of course when it rains then it then it then it stretches
and does a pretty good job but the fire hazard has is
phasing that kind of construction out it it's so
oh it's a rent it's a multistorey
last year luckily
no colonial is not the word had they use here that's
a multilevel it's called multilevel
it it's not it's not really that typical it's a custom home
i live in arlington actually this i'm working tonight actually in dallas
at ti here
oh yeah
oh yeah
oh yeah your right your right
how many calls have you made have you
oh really everyone everyone's higher than i am
yeah that i heard i know those words from the east when i was there but that they don't use that word here
do you have a basement
oh yeah that's typical up there to you know
oh yeah no the land is much cheaper here
yeah
yeah
yeah the lots aren't very big here either in the dallas fort worth area
but the basement there just aren't any basements i don't know of anyone ever even thought of putting a basement in here
it used to be a pier and beam where they would drill piers and the first you would have a crawl space underneath your house but that's phased out in the last twenty five years where it's all slab
yeah
and they say that the reason they don't put pier i think it's cheaper like you say but the soil does move a lot here and they say that you just couldn't
put a basement in the soil but i'd think they just to me i don't know really know why it wouldn't work i think you can put a basement in anywhere it's just not popular
yeah really
no it's not very high some of the water here
yeah this is dallas there the water's down two thousand feet
yeah i guess it's the style i really don't have an answer here because of the tornado i always thought tornados i thought people would build a lot of storm cellars you know or shelters you know but even that is not popular at all i don't know i don't know of anyone doing that
i don't even see it in the newspaper where people advertise that they have storm cellars or anything they just don't have them period
yeah it's multilevel yeah like my garage i have a bedroom over
split level yeah
right
right exactly
right
right
yeah
what's your typical heating up there in maryland gas or
uh-huh
yeah
oh really
well heat pumps nice up there it would probably work pretty well
yeah that's true
well they should yeah because it's warmer in the winter or you have less of a winter down here of course it's a short winter but it does get down to five degrees occasionally
but i don't really know if heat pumps are that popular yet i guess i don't i haven't been that close to it in the newer homes
yeah we have heat some have air-conditioning units i have an all electric house but it's fifty there's a lot of gas houses here because it's so popular
oh yeah
people i think probably prefer natural gas for heating
i don't i'm an engineer and i don't like the danger of it i've seen too many houses here blowup and i think yeah and i just think
when i had a gas
fireplace you know i had and i saw the way it was yeah it went over my daughter's bedrooms you know over the garage i thought and there's just too many fittings in this thing to leak and so i just i never did hook that sucker up so i just took it out completely
although people love gas here but i i'm ultraconservative on safety and i just don't want it
yeah well i've heard
yeah i've heard people say that i and i
yeah
yeah
right
oh yeah no i i've known people love it for years and but we've done without it for twenty years here and
yeah no i haven't i haven't really noticed i don't miss it you know with our of course i'm against i'm just i'm one of the
a million people that is against gas
no
no there's not much in front there's no sitting out front you know there's no like in the east when i was young
of course it goes way back we used to sit out front i had a porch up front but no there's not a porch
yeah oh yeah
i wish i had that you know
right i think the old ways in a lot of ways should come back
but no the
yeah no that there it's not popular here either screens in screen in is not that that's so that's
not like not like you have up there no
it's too dry it's so dry that it's
dallas is super dry
three hundred miles yeah
yeah
our weather is like we have a we have a the raining season is now is april
and a little bit of may an then it goes into super dry all summer then you summer with a hurricane season but
yeah they have everything
no public there's essentially no septic not in dallas fort worth though you have it in the out lying areas but
two
no not carports it's essentially garages
yeah not dallas fort worth is you know the two car garage and certainly all air-conditioned
two thousand square feet is probably i don't know if that's average or not yeah
i think so too there's a lot of swimming pools here i don't have one
both
what kind of dog
is it a house dog
no i mean is it a house dog do you keep it in the house
and
really
i've just the opposite i've got a pomeranian he probably weighs about five
he thinks he's a little man
he's a little he presses around and struts
but i don't have a cat though that might be a little bit too much
do you keep the dog and the cat both in the house
yeah they get along
that's good
oh really
well how old is the dog
goodness mine's only i guess three
what made you get a dog and a cat
so you compromised
goodness
well i got my little dog to keep me company and now i'm hardly ever at home
so now it's like whenever you come in he's all over you
oh really
yeah it's like a new face
something i guess like just something new and different
that's good
thinks i think that brian would probably do the same thing
well i've heard that pets are like to people that are sick or to older people that they're have like calming effects on them
especially i guess if they have like high blood pressure or
like heart conditions it just kind of helps to have a little or a dog or a cat or something around just to lavish the attention on it kind of calms them
yeah
that's true
yeah
there's something i was going to tell you and i forgot just totally went out the window
and then y'all decided to keep it
isn't that funny how there's always a story behind something
oh
well do you have names that are appropriate with more or less how you found them or how you got them or anything or
no
oscar anne well that's a new one
oh i see
um-hum
lord did you have a problem naming coming up with names for them
it took me like three weeks to name mine because i kept saying well i want to find a name that fits
and i actually had for a couple of days had started calling
okay
like what
right
i don't like that either hm no
uh-huh
well
you don't wanna do that they're vulgar
did he go to the concert where they gave them about fifteen minutes and then left
one with very they were like an hour and a half late coming
poison and motley crue and guns and roses you know that
well
but i like i have season tickets to the opera hang on just a minute
oh okay i have season tickets to the opera and i love that and i have season tickets to the summer musicals and i love that so i have
musicals like well sometimes you go back to the old rodgers and hammerstein's of oklahoma and carousel
south pacific you know it's like theater in singing
oh dear it still is every summer they have they have about six shows
what
your main people now are sondheim and andrew lloyd webber with phantom of the opera and starlight express cats
and it's really become quite sophisticated this summer they had grease and they had the buddy holly story
and some really good stuff so i like a real variety
oh no they're stories they're like a play oh yeah they're like a they're like a play only most of it's sung
wonderful sets and costumes
just really good
les miserables is a wonderful one it's based on victor hugo's les miserables
which takes place in france during it's not really during the french revolution it's pre french revolutionary days but
he's okay and who else dolly parton
and
i don't watch
no
oh how funny
i somehow or another i wonder if his hat fell off
yeah
do you ever watch jim
well let's see i think the best one i saw was probably sleeping with the enemy
have you seen silence of the lambs
oh well tell
no but i've heard it's really good
no i haven't seen that did you
what did you think of it
huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
yeah well i saw a few of the little coming attractions you know it looked really cute but
yeah well i've never been to california i've lived in washington but not california so
oh i didn't even realize that that's interesting hum
yeah i guess so did you see home alone
oh well i was kind of disappointed in that one
i've heard so much about it that you know it's such a great movie and you ought to go see it over and over again and
i thought it was just kind of like a spoiled brat staying at home and causing a lot of trouble
uh-huh
yeah i was kind of disappointed
yeah it's pretty intriguing
yeah it's a very unusual movie
kind of keeps you well the first part of it wasn't as
scary and intense as i thought it was going to be but toward the end it got more that way
yeah it really does
the only way they can get any information is through someone who's so crazy and bizarre it's hard to tell what he's going to do next so yeah it was a good movie
and then i thought sleeping with the enemy was even scarier but that's because it was about a man chasing a woman and that's my big fear so
i was trying to think if i've seen any others lately but
that probably pretty much sums up i don't get to go to the movie too much
no i haven't as a matter of fact it's on at the dollar movie around here and i was wanting to go
yeah i heard it was really good
yeah
yeah
um-hum yeah
yeah that's the way i as a matter of fact my sister believes in ghosts and she said that she thinks that's a real true portrayal of what it would be like
yeah
yeah i want to see that as a matter of fact i intended to go one night and didn't get to so
hopefully we'll go soon
no i haven't
huh
uh-huh
right
hum
oh really huh
yeah
oh
oh huh
uh-huh
oh well that is interesting
yeah huh
yeah oh
oh i have a six and a half year old that'd probably enjoy that
yeah huh
oh well i'll have to
have to take her to see that
um-hum
hum
oh really huh
wow that sounds like that would have been a hard movie to make
yeah i can imagine
no i haven't
huh i don't know anything about that either
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
hum
hum um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hum
i have never been to the inwood theatre
um-hum
yeah do you go there often
yeah hum
yeah well it sounds interesting
well does this
however this is set up tell you when you've talked for five minutes or
do you oh really oh that's interesting
oh okay well i didn't know this is the first call that i've made so i wasn't real sure if you
let me think if i have seen anything else that's interesting lately
uh-huh yeah silence of the lambs um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh i'm sure
i haven't seen either one of the other films she was in but my husband said that
he thought she was playing a real different role in this show yeah
yeah
yeah
i one of the things that i was really impressed with she has to
have an accent that she does a real good job with i it sounds so real that she sounds like she's from that area of the country
yeah i think it's like in the i don't know alabama georgia south carolina area or something it's
but i thought she did a really good job
yeah
the man that plays this bizarre character is really i don't know if i've ever seen him in a film before i don't
oh with anthony perkins yeah
i didn't remember him from anything else i i'm sure i've seen him in other movies but he looked so his face the entire movie just haunts you
and he did a real good job
yeah
yeah there was a big crowd there i think it's definitely getting some good ratings
um-hum
no i haven't
oh really
hum
oh i didn't realize that
well i thought it was i really enjoyed that movie i mean it scared me more than the other one but it was real intense to me i enjoyed it
yeah it was it has a real eerie beginning
and the man that she's married to is obviously crazy but at the first you don't really
know about that and it's real interesting the way it starts out
so i thought it was really
yeah
yeah it is it's a lot like that
i thought fatal attraction was a good movie did you like it
i didn't like the ending but
oh really
hum
i didn't know it was based on another film
um-hum
oh i see
huh
huh well i liked it until toward the end i
i didn't care for it too much but
yeah and it's kind of unbelievable too
the this woman can live through everything she lived through
yeah
well
yeah i think so well thanks for calling
uh-huh good-bye
right um-hum
oh
yeah
oh
uh-huh
oh he's interesting i like to watch him yeah
yeah
yes yeah i think you're right
yeah
yeah
i like to watch those skins games do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain you know for each hole they win they get the money for it i think those are pretty exciting
uh-huh
yeah
wow yeah that is good
right
yeah
uh-huh something to stay active at for a long time
yeah
yeah and they can still get good at it
yeah well maybe that's what i'll do when i have time later on
um-hum
true
oh yeah no my husband's pretty tolerant so he's not too bad to watch
oh no yeah
gosh now my husband has a temper but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course he's because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff so i guess he's real laid back about it
yes
right and then they want to play another course that's not they're not a member of and other fees it really is high
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
me either
yeah at least you're just you're competing against yourself i guess more than everybody else out there yeah
yeah that's kind of the way i feel
oh
right
okay what do you cook
oh really
oh yeah well see i consider baking different than cooking though yeah i can i can bake
oh yeah
no but my mother-in-law tells me and gets it and just loves to get the recipes
wow that's great yeah my mother used to like pick out a magazine and show us the pictures and say okay this is what we're going to have and we're like oh god no
yeah she did really she did really well but i mean like her four basic food groups were kind of like mine they're frozen canned boxed and take home and
i'm a very picky eater so that's another part of my problem when i look at a recipe there's ingredients that i don't like or won't taste and so it's kind of difficult
i'm from oklahoma and then i've been in texas for a long time but
oh yeah definitely now see i love stuff like that but and a lot of it i will eat but there's ingredients sometimes that i'm just like i don't even know what that is
where are you from
oh wow
oh yeah
oh yeah
no
oh really
uh-huh
ooh
that does sound good
okay i'll have to look for that
yeah
huh and it's in the gourmet section
yeah
yeah
huh
so your kids aren't picky eaters
oh
how funny
well that's what when i got married
both my husband and i had been living separately so my girlfriend wanted to give me a wine shower where people brought recipes
yeah it was really neat because they brought the bottle of wine and then they brought a recipe that went with the bottle of wine
and one of my girlfriends brought a really nice bottle of wine and she had written down the number to domino's pizza
oh yeah
yeah
well
desserts are definitely a weakness but oh i love them and i'm definitely a chocoholic but i found something it's a white chocolate mousse cake
that is just heaven
yeah but i wouldn't even know how to begin to make it
but i need to definitely find the recipe and at least attempt it because it it's so good
yeah
yeah
ooh i've never had apple cake
yeah
especially in the morning that's really good then
well i'm getting hungry now
god you really are a cook
well i did i went to the doctor the other day and my cholesterol is really high and so he's putting me on a special diet on tuesday and that's what when the category came up tonight i thought oh god i'm so glad this is tonight and not next week because
he's putting me on a liquid protein diet and so
it was two forty and i'm only twenty nine years old
so he said let's bring that down so he's putting me on some liquid protein and i'm not doing to be able to eat for two weeks
yeah i kept telling my husband while a go
it is for me and my age bracket
so i think it's supposed to be one eighty and he thought two forty was a little bit high for me
oh really
huh
yeah
uh-huh yeah
huh
yeah
yeah
i want a burrito
well it's like oprah winfrey says every once in a while you've just got to have ribs
yeah i i've tried them
well see that that's part of my problem though it goes back to being such a picky eater the only one i like is ranch which is like the worst as far as cholesterol goes so
i haven't tried the new ones that heart smart or not
i haven't tried the newest one yet so what i've been trying to do is just cutback because i just recently even started eating dressing and the only one i like i said is
yeah oh yeah here we go
call this number in the in during the day nine five zero three two seven
and person who answers there'll be able to help you
my wife happens to be a secretary in the in the group that does this
okay
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh
yeah
yeah plano just started a program where they gave everybody these big plastic garbage cans
and what they're doing is on thursday they pick up the regular garbage and these plastic garbage cans but on mondays if you they have these special huge paper bags
and if you put your clippings in that they'll pick that up on mondays -nd
right and then as i understand it they're planning to start giving everybody containers to put aluminum and glass in to recycle that as well so
right
oh wow
yeah i know all the grocery stores here have a bins when you walk in if you want to recycle your paper bags or plastic bags
so i think it's great i know the kids at school are being indoctrinated into the whole idea i know my daughter came home the other night
and she was all excited because they gave her an eight hundred number to call to find out where your local recycling center was
and she called it and turns out the nearest one's in garland which is about i don't know forty five minutes to an hour from here but
yeah we in fact i've got a car full of newspapers that we're trying to
the here's a sort of i guess a setback there were a couple of places that used to collect newspapers just around here and we went to all of them yesterday and none of them had bins for the papers so
i don't know if they just discontinued it or
oh yeah
yeah i know we don't sort that out
yeah and
oh yeah
yeah
right
right i you probably eat fast food type stuff and on the go
so
they come by collecting aluminum cans because we have places that you can go where you can the city has places where you can just dump the aluminum cans but
yeah
yeah well that's where that's where these kids take their aluminum cans
yeah
you don't get rich on those right huh
yeah the where i work they just started a paper drive and in fact everybody has two trash cans
one is for your normal trash and one is just for paper and they had a big campaign for it and there's a list of things that you're allowed to put in the paper bin
and you know and but they they're pretty good about it doesn't you know you can have the staples in them and the paper clips on them and the plastic windows
they take care of all of that but they don't want certain types of paper they don't want anything you know they don't want you know like transparencies overheads you know they don't want any of that in there
right they don't want the garbage from your from your lunch in there and there's even little this board
outside the cafeteria that shows has a it's a picture of a tree
with a with a squirrel going up and it's like a gauge and the higher the squirrel goes up the more trees you've saved
and it shows you how many thousands of trees have been saved because of the recycling program at work
right
right
right yeah
right
oh yeah
right well i know when i was a kid which was quite a while ago we used to collect newspapers and take them to the there was a
i don't know what it was a plant that it was a paper plant i guess it that was fairly close to where i lived in richmond virginia and
you could you bring your papers in to sell them there i remember doing that when i was a kid and
oh yeah sure yeah
right that's right
right
that's right yeah well that's good i mean we're such a we're such a throwaway society
it's nice because you know if you talk to people who grew up during the depression
nothing was wasted i mean everything and nowadays it's like you know nobody darns their socks i mean if you see a hole in it you throw it away by a new pair of socks you know kind of thing and i
yeah i you know i guess i believe the propaganda if you want to call it that you know we're
we're we have limited resources and we really should think about conserving them instead of wasting them
uh-huh
wow
yeah
wow
wow
yeah
you can't always i mean it'd be nice if you could if the landfill space was reusable but it all it isn't i know sometimes it is
i know there's place called mount trashmore which is a park that they built on top of a landfill
and i can't remember where it is i think it's in washington dc or thereabouts
but
yeah
yeah
well yeah i guess you know the scary part is that you don't know what the effects are you know fifty years from now
you know it's easy to say well we'll build a concrete hole and nothing'll happen and then they'll say well the only way to test that is over a long period of time so
right
right and there's
and there's no way to measure that i mean you know you the only way is to take the chance and see what happens forty years from now and who knows what kind of havoc you've created
by the
no
well i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes
well
i think first degree murder
probably warrants it
right
exactly recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever
i come from a state that has well i originally come from a state that has
the death penalty i come from florida and they're pretty liberal on it they tend to like fry people left and right which go ahead
yeah
yeah okay i think florida still uses electric chair
i don't i don't know in some ways i don't like it because it's like you're playing god
and that's not you know i don't think that's right but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not
with florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year they
um-hum
sure and it's like you know that's a big problem but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
and it's really you know it's it gets to be a big problem
go ahead
right
um-hum yeah because a lot of these guys you know they get in and they get off for good behavior
and i don't know i mean up in minnesota where i am now they don't have the death penalty and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system
you know because they figure well you know sure i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something
but then for if i if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten
oh sure you know i mean just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head
i don't know i think that may solve a lot of that maybe not solve it but
i don't know maybe even help a little bit
yeah
um-hum what do you do georgeanne
oh okay great what program you in
okay fantastic i'm a doctoral student at university of central florida
yeah i'm doing an internship up at honeywell
yeah
but
i don't know it's an interesting issue there's like you say in texas there's been quite a few and in florida in the last few years
uh-huh
oh is that right
okay
yeah i kind of yeah i've heard things about that i've heard that they don't mess around very much yeah
um-hum
jeez that's a lot of repeals
um-hum
yeah i don't know i i'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it i guess what is it what's the policy now with treason do they do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence i
yeah
yeah
are you really
uh-huh which are both kind of small
uh-huh are you looking for an american car or you open to buying foreign cars
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
personally i have a japanese car right now and i really like it a lot i think the japanese really build good cars and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole
you know buy american keep american auto workers working right now but i feel that the japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our car manufacturers have for a while if i were to buy another car i would be
i would be partial to buying another japanese car but i would also look at american cars but when i bought the car that i bought now i did that also and i just felt that the japanese car was a much better product so if i were
right
right it is i'm kind of right now the next car i buy is gonna be
so i'm looking for more a two passenger car that
well i like the miata but i don't like it enough to buy it i would buy something actually the car that i really like right now is an eagle talon which is an american car but
something along that lines
because i have a an economy car right now which is okay but i think i i'd like to move on to something a little better
right
right that's when i bought the car that i bought i was looking for mileage and i was looking for dependability and something that was going to last a long time i was that i would get a
for the money that i was going to spend that i would get a return that was that was worth that money
so
right exactly
yeah
that's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
i've had
i've had one or two american cars i think and
and they were okay i had a pontiac once and i never had a problem with it but
a dodge omni at one point and that was i think what really prejudiced me against american cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality
car
so i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car
um-hum
right
which is a good deal
um-hum
right
yeah that
uh-huh
right
um-hum
oh really
that's great
so much more complex
yeah
great
yeah i've been hearing about that
goodness
um-hum
oh
oh goodness
that can be a disadvantage to the kids
oh no
oh that's a good idea
well great
um-hum
that's right
yeah i remember i mean during my i went to a private school during the junior high years which was
you know really during the development time of my life and it was a small school we had like maybe twenty people in junior high
i mean in my class like in seventh grade we had twenty in them and whenever we moved up to the eighth grade we had like twenty or twenty five in the whole eighth grade and we had two different classes so the ratio was real good
as far as the we had real good teachers and i learned a lot i feel like that if i had of gone to a private school during junior high i probably wouldn't have developed such good study skills because
i thought the private school was difficult i mean it gave a lot of homework and everything and it really helped me develop
my skills my
my memorization i can memorize things real well now and things like that but and then whenever i got to high school it was kind of a disadvantage to me to the fact that i was going from a class of twenty to a class of five hundred
and i do feel like that i was socially withdrawn to a certain extent because i didn't know anyone
and i was a freshman in high school you know and i was the peon
but it probably took i don't know maybe the first semester to get to get to where i was really comfortable with school because i hadn't been in the public school system for so long and it is just it's really different
it the children there are a lot a lot wilder than what i was used to i was i grew up in a very protective home and then whenever i got to high school things were just
so much different especially nowadays i mean even the high school that i went to just recently they put up these little metal detectors at each door when you walk in to make sure you don't have a gun and things like that and
i mean it's gotten worse i graduated about two years ago and even in the past two years it's gotten i mean it's just increased the crime and the drugs and the violence and everything have just increased enormously
so
um-hum
golly
um-hum
oh goodness
oh no
um-hum
yeah
i always used to do the you know the fairly simple repairs recently i haven't because time's become more of a premium for me
uh-huh
right i
um-hum
right
oh because you couldn't you couldn't access it
right
right
yeah that that's part of the reason why i have cut down also is that same reason last thing i did was just replace my light on
you know headlights in the front now that one i you know it they actually said to go in and get the service person to do that too and i said well forget that
and it was kind of a pain
because it i didn't it doesn't have a off
yeah it's one of those flipping type headlights
and you
right and some of them you know they have one click where you where it goes up and it's not on some of the some but this one did not
right
um-hum
-t's great then that's the other thing is that there always seems to be some really weird tool
and things like you know oil filters every car now it's so tight in the region where the engines are you can never get to the oil filter
though i guess it's getting a little better again because what they did is first they used to have the big cars and big engines
then they got the small cars with the not well designed engines now they're redesigning enough that to some extent it's accessible again but i remember a couple of those cars you know you'd sit there and say
there's no way anyone could get in there unless they could take the car and put it up into the air
right
and i every year you hear somebody gets themselves killed by climbing under a car or under a jack and the only thing you know i guess you
okay
no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time find that it's
really a little more economical and we have or i found that i have the time and i kind of enjoyed it over here in texas i used to live in arizona and it was very frustrating because i didn't have the
so
um-hum is that enough during the hotter times of the year
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before
and it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold they'd freeze down and by the time they the flowers would
so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding so
i'm gonna try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that
you know feels
um-hum
yeah those are enjoyable
oh did you
um-hum
those are nice
uh-huh
yeah i haven't done much in bulbs in fact i received as a christmas present a
a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water at any time and
and after it started to sprout put in sunny window and it's it just grew like crazy but i don't have any flowers on it i don't know how long that takes or if there's anything i need to do differently but
no i'm thinking white narcissus or something like a white paper flower or something
and so i don't know
no not really and in plano and most of the newer areas of texas they have just the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard we have a pool in our backyard and we did plan it to where we had some
some play yard last over but it's
it's you know very small but most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's about the size of most of them
so i guess we're kind of fortunate everyone looks at that with our at our yard with kind of a sense of awe like wow you really got you know some grass back there
and
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
yeah
i'm not jimmy johnson's fan
i just really don't care much it's kind of hard not to be a cowboy fan though
they've always been you know my favorite
i'll bet they are
football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world
hit a bad season and it's you know the coach's fault let's dump him
first good season the coach can do no wrong
but they've dallas has always been good ahead you know heading good players and both running
running backs and defense
who's their competition gonna be
course i think you know you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season
because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal and you know it can be a or injuries that have newly happened
and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one you played
well he
he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at ou
ou's always been known for their running game more than
right
oh i tell you they've not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts
yep they then he went out to
let's see southern cal is that where you went
yeah
so
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hum well that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it'd be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to mandatory
yeah i kind of agree with that
i don't think you know it they shouldn't have they should have the same rights as anyone else
you know it shouldn't be anything shouldn't be mandatory other than i guess like when you come to paying taxes or something like that
or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe
people be more eagle to do it uh-huh yeah
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's a good idea i think they should have more programs like that
and i think us being taxpayers we pay for people that's in jail or in trouble anyway
so they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas
and i agree wholeheartedly
yeah but the thing is that it's not enough of that kind of stuff going on
because you like you say it's a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors why have someone in jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor
and sometimes you know putting them in jail doesn't really help
because there's nothing in there that to rebil rebilitate rebilihatate them and then when they get out they because they have the stigmatism of being in jail they
um-hum
um-hum
right
nbc
um-hum
yeah
yeah i usually tend to just you know rely on you know tv again you know just through the grapevine just to know like
yeah i think you pretty much have to listen to like an all news station to get any news at all
well i really don't like about tv especially local news as compared to like national news is just
and you know it's
it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom
or like the news because they would always have you know the wonderful investigative reports you know is you're kids bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know
um-hum
yeah also i have the observation with
with the press is that like any stories that
i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life
you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had
more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
it's something wrong
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah the farm report
um-hum
yeah also i have founded like in
newspapers probably aren't as bad as television but i just you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for
yeah
yeah i have
you know i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know
very watered down very
you know i mean it just it just seemed to lack any sort of debate
you know you know not saying that we that we that we definitely should have been there or we shouldn't have been there but it just seemed like you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah and i really think that you know in the in the involvement that
the press states you know that the military basically sets the press
hi this is laurie and i'm in garland
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
right
maybe in the future we haven't quite decided if i'm gonna i'm working part time now and i don't know if i'll be doing that or what we're gonna do but if we do then
i'm gonna need to find somebody and our church has a mother's day out program which they started last year and we know a lot of people at the church so i would feel very confident with leaving
um-hum
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
time uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um-hum you know it's kind of scary i guess because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately and so it's
i guess it's such a growing concern but then there's a lot of good things you don't hear
right
to children
right
uh-huh
right
yeah we're pretty excited to
yeah that you know we have been thinking about that but it's a little ways off in the future but i figure you know i'd probably start asking
around at church because i know that they have a limit as to how old they can be before they you know before you can bring them in
uh-huh
hum
right
uh-huh
have you ever been drug tested
uh-huh
yeah
i had i've had two or three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at a job
different jobs i had one at ti and then one at another engineering company and
really i mean i don't mind them i don't do drugs anyway i guess if i did maybe i would but
i don't know i know a girl that she's a nurse and they get drug tested randomly i've never been randomly drug tested
but that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it
yeah i guess so
i guess so
do you think that it's right
uh-huh
right
right
that's true
right
that's true
i believe it's right especially for certain jobs
i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that i think they should be randomly drug tested i believe full force in that
i don't know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be
you know secretaries aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something so
i don't know i i'm kind of biased too because i don't do drugs and so i really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me because i have nothing to worry about
so i guess that's kind of biased
yeah it does
yeah that's true
yeah
that's true
but what do you do about the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before and you know it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything and they happen to be tested monday morning
and they could be fired for that
you know that that's kind of unfair also
yeah i guess so i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences
that's true
that's true
that's true
yeah i think so more than drugs
and i know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab
they would pay for an alcohol but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation
yeah
that's true
i think that's fair
yeah
that's true
it's a urine test and they
it was really very official you have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours and
and you have to fill the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that so that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's i guess or something
i know i'm amazed at the things people will do
it is amazing i guess there are people that do that and they are those are expensive tests i'm glad i never had to pay for one
yeah i guess so
oh really
oh that's weird
yeah
that's wild
it's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body
yeah that's true
well i enjoyed talking to you
bye
i really haven't had too many problems seems to me that everything that i buy
goes bad just after the warranty runs out
yeah i've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave
all three and they unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time when i bought my new house and
i really don't have any recourse so i had to call and have them all repaired and that
yeah the warranty on the refrigerator the refrigerator warranty's still good but the ice maker itself
lasted three years and it was three years and two months
no
watch out
um-hum
hm
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but
i just it was within two days that all three of these stopped working and the
the ice maker was had to have a new pump and the
microwave had to have some kind of something i can't even pronounce and they
the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them
within two days of each other
i was
it wasn't a good week i was pretty mad
and plus the place that i'd bought them all had gone out of business so
even if i think even if i had
had kept the warranty the service agreements were
with the companies that manufactured but still they were through that
retailer so i don't know if i could've taken it to another retailer or not
but i didn't have to worry about all that because
they weren't under warranty
so
it was a call to the local appliance dealer
who came out and fixed them all but
i the only other things that i've ever had trouble with
i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
yeah i've had two or three of those go out one was under warranty and
the other two weren't but i just
other than that you know tvs and
things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with i don't think products are getting much better though
oh really that's interesting
do you do you test each individual one or do you just test
like if you've got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
um-hum
well that's something i've never had to use it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident so
luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test
but i think it's a great idea i'm
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to
to come about but that
oh i'm sure they wanna be thorough before they but even you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car
if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because
it just seems like a real worthwhile thing i'm not a real big seat belt my
uh-huh none at all huh
i see yeah has it
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that
that's what we got rid of an american express card for the same reason is though we have a credit union and we get our cards our other mastercards for free so we don't have to pay a fee at all
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then all the other the rest of us did and he was like six hundred dollars yeah and it was we were we all had it was a viral pneumonia it was really bad and we were just horribly sick but i mean six hundred dollars i can't come up with
yeah all the doctors here will take a visa so that and you know and go to kmart and use the pharmacy to pay for the medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back
you know and so our part of it was still twenty percent but twenty percent i can payoff in one month whereas you know then i got to wait for the rest of it to come back from aetna but it basically floats
you know during the time because we've got a thirty day grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within that time and that's usually enough time for the insurance to get back
i try to make that our biggest use of credit cards i know people who are so in debt people who have five visa cards i can't you know it's like why did you go get they charged up one so then they but they were still paying their minimum so their credit rating was still good
and you would you know they get this in the mail say oh well we can't use that one anymore we'll just get another one and that's like who you
oh
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah
but that's
that's a good way to make a big problem in your marriage real quick gosh that's just dishonest
be well i think i would feel the same way i'd really feel like i'd been deceived you know that wasn't the thing to do
uh-huh
yeah we've tried to do that we've paid ours off you know all the way down to where we had everything down to zero and especially right before i quit work two years ago to stay home with the kids
and before i left we had everything paid off we were in great shape we were putting money you know because we were both working we were finally putting money in
but we've gone back the other way to some extent because just because there are times when you just can't pay it all
because there are just too many bills
yeah
uh-huh
oh isn't that silly i sent that one back because we had used it for a year and we had used a thousand dollars worth during the year and what we and i think we got back fifty cents or something it was like please what is this is and the interest rate on it was eighteen or nineteen percent
and our visa card was we could get through our credit union was like fourteen percent so we just we sent it back we
we keep gas credit cards and we have visa and then i have started my own business i have a photography business and i went ahead and got a separate visa just for that photography business because there are things that i have to buy
and with my when i when i take things to the lab to get developed it's several hundred dollars at a time and i was using up all of our personal credit
with my photography business even though again it's paying off every month because i'm putting everything
i'm you know i'm getting the pictures and i'm taking them back to the i already have their money but i wasn't depositing them until i gave them the pictures back
i guess
it's just you when i think about that this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee
for a returned check so now she's already doubled the price of her check and i've sent it through a second time because they said there's money in the account now
you know and if it doesn't go through the second time that woman's out thirty bucks
for one twelve dollar check
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
is not anymore they'll take it you know at the cash price or you they'll now let you write a check if you have their card so you pay for it immediately instead of you know putting it off for a month
what's that writing a check for gas
well all of them down here you had a cash price for gasoline and a credit card price
right that's supposedly
uh-huh
right and they've changed that now stop it go play and leave me alone
yeah and so i'm using the other ones now because they're just as easy to get to and then they're nickel a gallon cheaper so
yes
we try not to we're probably the only two people in the united states the bank the banks don't want to hear from us because they want those people who charge it up to ten thousand dollars and then get all yeah and then pay fifty dollars a month and it all goes to interest
oh yeah ours are like seven percent we've got one and with ira stuff in it and
jeez you can't get any interest rates
well the one i think is interesting is the california los angeles police chief who says he wants to -sign and did you hear yesterday that mayor bradley said that he should
think it i think what's interesting is that the political activists jesse jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating
i find it interesting that outsiders would bother to go in how do how do you feel about people like jesse jackson getting involved
do you think gates should resign
speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with john wiley price
what do you think of him
obvious attention to efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the i guess he's on the county
and is really quite agreeable and that the stuff we see in the
you know in the media is well he's really just trying to make a political statement i
i find that an interesting element of politics that we don't that most people would not know that john wiley price apparently is a is a
you know course he's got in this deal over racism and you know name calling and all this but apparently he's a worker
you may disagree with him but i find this whole what do you think of this fourteen one and ten four one in dallas
i -gree with you but did you see the map they drew up on how they were gonna divide up the districts
it was it was the strangest i'm not sure it was gerrymandered but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i guess i'm a little cynical of the of the power base
and i don't quite understand why the power base doesn't
why they don't go with fourteen one
you know
and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the i think it's hispanics don't vote because they don't think
that they have any affect and it's i guess i am disappointed with dallas in that the fourteen one it
i don't know you can you can disagree with al lipscomb and what's the lady's name
yeah you can disagree with what they're doing and what they're saying but in reality i think they're
they're trying to represent their constituents
yeah and i but i think even i even those people are it's like pauken and box and these people i think it's i find it interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that
the question is did we get anything good done it's like this whole school issue are you involved in the schools at all public school
this whole thing down there where they're trying to
you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools and it all seems you know everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else so
i have got to run to a meeting it's good talking to you i don't think we've gone our ten minutes but i think we've talked long enough so
yes
really what do you do now
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
oh okay
yes i do yeah and i'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins have you had yours now yeah
oh that's why i asked you i guess it you know it does go in cycles and not everyone got theirs right away
and i was so relieved because i've been making a real concerted effort make you know recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because wal-mart collected it
and my garage was just getting overwhelmed and of course i didn't go weekly so it became quite a big thing and
yes yeah
uh-huh
yeah well i found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two
ha so it was wasting a lot of time
yeah thinking i was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned
but you know but it it's not that hard now that i've got this system under control yeah
ah uh-huh
yeah i do find that i don't have as much to throw away because the all the bulky things are being tossed in with the recycling and
i don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than what are some of the things they don't recycle oh one thing i thought about the other day were batteries just everyday regular batteries
supposedly you know leak and contaminate the landfills and yet what am i going to do when i have a couple double a batteries to toss out and they don't take
yeah that's what happens because
yeah
yeah but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something
if they've got these bins for all the other little items i'm sure if people will have batteries you know quite often to toss out
uh-huh
oh
oh is that right
huh
yeah
well except i know it would just be not cost effective they've already got all this money out on hired getting the trucks and hiring people to work them i'm sure they couldn't afford that but
yeah oh yeah
oh my goodness it is sad you know they paid for those things anyway or our taxes do and
um-hum
oh how there
all right so you live in dallas
now i understand that the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down
oh
yeah uh-huh yeah we have a single family home in northern virginia just outside of washington
huh do you live in the high-rise
uh-huh
oh okay so you just you have one floor all to yourself oh okay
oh that's nice do you get your own washer dryer
oh
yeah that is nice
yeah
yeah unfortunately we're we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids and we have a three bedroom house and it's pretty much filled up right now
yeah um-hum get an extra bedroom or a basement right now it's just a single level rambler
oh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well out here we live in what used to be like a prairie or whatever a natural you know
natural grasslands and they it's just you go down four inches and you get to well fourteen inches you get to sandstone
no virginia yeah it's sort of unusual really most of virginia is clay
uh-huh
and anything inside that beltway the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive
so you know you really can't afford i could never afford a house inside the beltway that's why we came out here this is called the country you know with only you know maybe twenty miles total from dc twenty five
from the city but it's considered the country since it's you know that far out
but yeah we live out by dulles airport
not too much of northern virginia is like that anymore land has gotten so expensive they just can't afford to have low income housing like that
no we're in a development there's yeah there's another one half an acre away or a quarter acre away rather
oh no huh-uh yeah its a stand alone single family home i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up
my folks had an apartment for a while when we were kids but
for the most part they always had you know and pennsylvania always had a single family home and so
you know as soon as we could we got a single family home and that's all i ever knew growing up so i stayed in a townhouse for two years and then saved up enough money to get a
well so we can have a conversation on agreeing with one another today right because we keep working to see if we can find any candidates who will help us
change the trend that we have seem to have of interfering with people's personal life
well that's always a problem i have to admit that back when the texas governorship
race was going on that was the one thing that made me really pleased with ann richards is that she refused to get involved in discussing that whole issue
for self decrimi self incrimination kind of thing yeah
yeah because the tests are equally unreliable and
personally i don't even think it's a question of whether they're reliable or not i mean it doesn't matter how reliable they are then i think that it's inappropriate you know actually i can almost understand it more for somebody who's
getting ready to hire someone than i can allowing them to spot test or random test people who are
currently employed because i think that current employment you know continuation of employment should be based on performance
okay
stop and think about it you can get awfully hostile and decide to take care of the whole world one day or something yeah well you're absolutely right
you're absolutely right
it certainly sounds that if that's what college students are doing that that's anti productive
yeah
i just you know unfortunately i've talked with a
some friends of mine who are lawyers recently about that because my husband's in a job situation that
makes him
subject to this sort of thing and it makes him extremely unhappy with his work place
and you know not that he does it not that he's ever done it you know i mean he's one of the straightest people i know which is it and it has nothing to do with
you know with any of the rest of it he doesn't like the feeling of loss of control so he doesn't
so he yeah so he wouldn't do it but on the other hand he also doesn't like the sense of loss of control of his personal life
well go ahead if you're
similar to the one they use at for training
in my business i have to tie into the mainframe and also into a minicomputer a 990
so i use a terminal emulation in talking to other computers plus word processing i do quite a bit of that
the new one the 386 it's got windows on it and so you can toggle back and forth between applications and you know get a
get a lot quicker in and out
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
we're supposed to be getting a fifteen hundred minicomputer pretty soon
replace our 990 huh
no it's a ti made 1500 it's a minicomputer
it's a newer version of the nine ninety which is one they had
it uses unix as one of the operating systems
but
i got a lot of stuff to learn i haven't used it that much so
um-hum
that's like i learned dfm and pfm you know professional file manager which is can be used as a word processor it doesn't
it does everything i need moves splits you know all that but
doesn't have some of the little fancy stuff like underline caps i mean bold and all that so
that's other than that it's you know perfectly suitable for most things i do
um-hum
no this elderly care of the elderly i am looking at this right now with my father
that
and his health is so bad that we don't feel right about you know just letting him do what he wants to do
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah
i've looked for all both ends of the scale really from your kind of state run things to the very private elite type and it really
boils down i think to one thing you're putting somebody in there and more or less waiting for them to die
and it's sad but that's the way we've been brought up to look at it
and i hate it but there comes a time when this is what happens
especially with the way medicine is today it's keeping us alive longer and
we're living longer so therefore you know
right
yeah it's kind of our
right
uh-huh
right well that's
uh-huh
right
and it's
but i don't know what other solution there is eventually we're going to have to put him in a home some place
uh-huh
right
right
i do i play tennis and softball and i do a little bit of woodworking around the house furniture stripping and stuff like that
well i have this huge kitchen cabinet that it was like an old cabinet my buildings from was built in nineteen oh four
so i have this cabinet that had about eight layers of paint on it and i stripped it down and i'm still working on it for about it's been about a year that i've been working on it
it's beautiful moldings and a beautiful cabinet and as soon as i'm done with it should be good
we use like a heat gun to strip it and then chemicals to get the rest of the paint out of the crevices and stuff like that
yeah it's probably movable the cabinet but it would be tough to move i was able to take some of the pieces apart it's like a kitchen pantry basically
i was able to take some of the pieces apart like some of the shelves out to clean them out independently and stuff
no i'd done nothing like it before but a neighbor of ours had done this and it looked nice so we figured we'd try it ourselves
really
you do crossword puzzles mostly or
is that what you do for a living or you do other things
huh grand
fantastic
are you from texas
oh
oh okay
well you have yeah you have a good career for that crossword puzzles and writing you don't have to go out my wife's my wife's an editor and we just had our first child so she's
magazines she'd worked for a dance magazine and american oh you probably know the american booksellers association
right she's worked for them for about the last year or so and they just had their convention in new york
and
she worked on the show daily doing the you know the daily magazine that they print out
so that's good and they've now that she's possibly probably not going to go back to work at least for a few years she's gotten freelance work from people
yeah she would anything like that
no we're from new york
yes
right
oh let me let me give you let me give you our address
great sounds good
she loves to read that's really the type of work that she would like to do even though she never did that professionally
yeah she's started in other fashions but not specifically reading novels and editing them and proofreading them and stuff so i think she would like that
right
great
her name's mary c murphy
and her address is two twenty five
west end avenue
hm
right yeah i'm i need to get i'm pretty bad about that i'm lazy i should i know i want i always say that i need to get start running and i going to try and do that this summer
because i never have time i always put it off by the time i get back from classes it's late at night and i don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever because i i'm getting a gut here i got to get back into shape
hm
yeah
yeah i mean
i do it i guess i'm going to do it because i want to get in shape
i'm not it's not something i really enjoy all that much although i'll probably i mean once i get into it and i if i if i get into better shape then it'll be it won't be as much of a chore to me

right
yeah
yeah it's something i it's like i'm young and i should get started getting into shape i don't want to at one i mean one point it's going to be too late to do it like
yeah
hm
well let me preface it i'm a i was a staff officer in vietnam in sixty nine and seventy
and i'm in active reserve now so
i'm probably not going to have the opinion you think i would have
it's it was an interesting
in that i think that he gave the american people some a sense of the fact that wars are really run by politicians
i are you old enough to remember the war
yeah
well december seventy two was when we bombed north vietnam and
and they released the prisoners in early seventy three so that time frame
i think the significant thing is today did you did you see barbara walters interview with schwartzkopf
well they
well
what what's your perspective on it
yes
well the difficulty i have is that are we our neighbor's keepers
and this is what i find particularly difficult in that if we see injustice and whether it's in a you know chicago or
or dallas i think if we see it you know we see john wiley price hollering injustice i think that's wrong now the question is was there injustice in vietnam or was there injustice in iraq and kuwait
the difficult i point is to where do we step in and i think that we
that's the part i have difficulty and the other part is that the when your when your
when you're looking at vietnam and you say well
is fifty eight thousand lives worth it
and i don't know that anything is worth fifty eight thousand lives
well the other issue is how do you allow how do you allow injustice just like the policeman in los angeles
how could how could you stand there and watch them beat that guy
if your brother or your sister were being beaten
by the authorities do we step in well
in some cases we would and i think that's what makes it so difficult
but
yeah but the other the other difficulty is that it's just if you take the admonition to feed my sheep
and the question is who are my sheep
and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry
but
yes they did the
i think the biggest difficulty is that when your at an agrarian economy like south vietnam was that in reality the poor farmer poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes
and the question is who was he going to pay it to
the communists or the alleged democrats democratic form of government and i
i think that's i think i think that's a little was a difficult part there and i we didn't understand the culture we couldn't we had we had a young lady that was fourteen that worked in our
in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old and the people looked like children i mean you couldn't imagine that one would conceal a bomb and
and do these kind of things i think culturally it really destroyed a lot of the people that went over and saw these people you just couldn't believe that they would
that they would be mean and drop bombs and kill people and then we would turn around and napalm them you know if
and i think there was a lot of a lot of tearing of emotions and i think that if anything that when schwartzkopf he was saying the idea that we learned we learned a lot from vietnam
now it was it was it was in general bad but and i don't know the problem is now i'm concerned a little bit that now that the gulf war is on that we're going to think it was a good war and it was okay
in any event
well the difficulty is if you look in the old testament and the numbers of places that the lord went out and just simply struck down and that was part of the problem when they went into the promised land
that they that they didn't destroy everybody and that that's
and
why did you do it that way
what do you
yeah
well and i and even at the even at the local level when somebody's assaulted
what do you do turn the other cheek
yeah
yeah in fact i'm still going
well i don't know about that but i in fact i'm in the process of trying to choose a phd school
well computer science and cognitive science so
oh i see
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
to a parent well you know the thing is when you're a kid
and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want an and i mean choosing from my experience you know my i thought you know my i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want
but
i don't know at the same time you have to decide what is important about the school you know the size of it or
yeah
yeah
yeah that's disruptive
oh yeah well yeah i see what you're saying
yeah
yeah i'm just getting ready to go to lunch yeah that's like what we were saying though would you advise a private school or a public school you know what's the trade off there what
could you get me those
oh i see
yeah
yeah i think i would agree with that in fact the thing that i'm going through the same thing where in graduate school i was trying to choose you know a particular institution might be better
for my area yet
like say you know the university of small town in arkansas or something might have some top specialists in my area yet if i go to u of i or cmu or you know some you know any big name school
my quality of education might not be that much better but it's the same thing as you know what will the name recognition get me kind of thing
yeah that's usually the basic criteria
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
where was i at oh in going to school you get taught
and actually in the midwest especially a lot of the schools have like university of missouri will have a main campus like columbia which is big multi disciplinary and they'll have a satellite campus in a usually in a smaller town
that specializes in the technical field so you've really
i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything
yeah
okay
well i think we're we have pretty much narrowed it down to a mazda minivan
the new the m p v
the one that's the all wheel drive
yes
right now we have we have we have a four door you know sedan but it's just it just doesn't have quite as much room and it's not very comfortable to drive long distance in
well we've been looking for about you know two years to decide but you know with the style changes you know they're a lot of them are changing right now and we're trying to wait until we see what it's going to you know the style going to stay for a while
and supposedly the mazda is going to change this coming year
and we'll just we'll wait till the ninety twos come out
no so that's pretty much you know where we stand now how about how about you
yeah
yeah you pretty much have to take advantage of the wild and crazy while you can and then you got to turn into the practical
that's kind of the way i've had to transition i was into you know the sportier cars and then when it comes to putting car seats and all that kind of stuff in it you know you just don't
can't get away with it any longer
or then and then you got to wait until you're you know after your kids are grown and you can scale back down again
but you know right now i have a pickup truck
and it's one of the supercabs and you can get you can get you know kids and everything in there the only thing is it's not very comfortable
yeah
well they've made some changes over the you know the last couple of years since they've come out this year they're coming out with a new transmission a little bit heavier duty transmission
which the japanese are not well known for but
but they're supposedly getting a new transmission in fact i think board warner's the one that going to going to design it for them
and that'll help some and they're going to change the interior to where the backseat itself can either be removed or laid laying down into a bed
whereas now it can't
you can lean it back a little bit but not all the way
so we're looking at those type things also
yeah plus you know the wheel base
the way it is right now the all wheel drive
the it's a little bit higher up off the ground but they're going to raise it three more inches up
and a little bit more clearance
and you know not that i really need it for any but i like sitting up high so you can see
yes
that's kind of interesting
forty seven thousand dollars is
it's a little stiff
yeah i agree i don't think even if i had the money to spend on it i don't think i'd buy one
plus nowadays you know it cars are high anyway you know you can't hardly get anything decent for less than you know nineteen or twenty
and that's a pretty big investment even nowadays and i want something that's going to last me for at least seven eight years
and
i just can't see you know these people spending these thirty five to forty five thousand dollars on bmws and mercedes and then trading them every year or two
god that's so that's silly
i like i say i think even if i had the money i wouldn't want something like that it's just not within my it's just it's impractical
too many other good things you can do with the money besides waste it i just you know there's too many people that need things and
you know places that you can put it
not to waste money like that
yeah i mean it'd be nice to be able to afford it but i i'm just not i even if i had the money i i'm i know for a fact i just wouldn't i wouldn't buy one i just can't bring myself to do that kind of stuff
but
we try to keep our cars on an average of eight to ten years if we can if we can get by with it we have a volvo right now that's
it's seven years old and it's got about eighty five thousand miles on it and it still drives like it's brand new
about that's about right and we anticipate on keeping that car for hopefully another five six seven years if we can if we can make it go that long
well volvos there's a lot of them that we in fact we have a mutual friend
my wife and i that
they just passed three hundred thousand miles on theirs
it's still mechanically fine now you know there there's money to invest in it during that three hundred thousand miles you know timing chains and various other things but
all in all if you if you take it mileage based on what you spent over that life of the car
relatively cheap
so
you know i so far i can't complain it's been a good car and we're going we're like i say we'll try to keep it for a long time it's been paid off for several years
yeah and
the only other thing is you know the pickup truck's nice but it's impractical for traveling and family so we'll get something that we can haul stuff in if we have to and then have it for you know trips and everything
well nowadays it pays to shop because you're going to have to live with it for a while you know if you if you're paying for it for three or four years
that's a long time right there in itself and then you don't want to turn around and you know the next time you buy a car it's going to be more expensive and you don't want to start another payment that's going to be up around four or five hundred dollars a month
so it it's crazy so
but the little that eighty two bonneville that you have that that's probably a pretty good car
yeah well you know things like that go out you know if you replace them it's just so costly anyway
it's crazy
yeah
well and your wife has what kind of car
oh ferenza
yeah okay that's pontiac okay or olds firenza yeah
um-hum
so now you've got some rust
that's terrible that's one that's one bad thing about living in an area where you have to put salt on the roads
oh
well my position in general is that i'm supportive of it but i'm not supportive of the way that it's currently administered
it takes so long with the appeals process that it's simply impossible to say that it's that it's consistent administration of justice
if the penalty could be executed swiftly and surely upon people who deserved it when there was evidence beyond a
a reasonable doubt that they had committed a crime worthy of it then i think it should be done
that's right but as it stands now it's not a deterrent we just had a fellow here in our county who has he's been on death row for seventeen years and just had his sentence overturned for the third time on a technicality
everybody knows he did it
this last technicality was simply because the language of the decision handed down by the jury saying that he should get the death penalty was not precisely as it is stated in the statute that it should be
and that was it i mean it was a very simple i mean they fully intended to give him the death penalty they had a unanimous decision but when they drafted the decision
very minor mistake but it was enough for the state supreme court to say that the that the decision was invalid and that they had to empanel a new jury to consider the death penalty again
that kind of thing and the way that people search and search for those kind of things just disgusts me
with it being that way
it ends up costing us so much money so much more to have the death penalty than to not have it that i'm almost inclined to say do away with it
the problem that i see is what do we have instead
here in georgia we don't have a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole
if someone gets life in prison they are generally released in seven years if they behave well
and we have had people get out in seven years and commit another murder
yeah
there's video tape of it
yeah
um-hum
right i actually i live in the city and i guess it is a concern of mine
you know for my own safety
oh that's right
i think it is bad in certain areas however i think the area that i live in it's not
the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city i think it seems that there's certain areas where the crime is focused
well i think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put more guys more cops higher visibility
and it had some impact but not a tremendous amount
and probably
they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think's the best way there is
yeah
you know particularly in some of the housing projects
you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and they've got to do more than just having cops there they've got to kind of change the way people think about it
well i've been to i'd say it's probably in the top
top ten in terms of crime
it's nowhere near as bad as new york city for example probably not as bad as detroit
no
yeah that seems to be true yeah if you've ever been to like new york city and
you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed it's that obvious
yeah that's true
with a big stick or
right
no the only thing i've ever had is i've had my wallet lifted
but that was in a more of a
and kind of passed it off so i didn't know who had it
i've had that happen but that's about it
oh yeah
hum
really well i've had my
um-hum i've had my car stolen so maybe that counts
yeah
oh no that was in the northern up near cumberland mall area it's actually cobb county but it is atlanta
and there's a lot of car thefts in that area
right yeah
yeah
yeah mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage but they didn't they didn't strip it
so i got it back
yeah
than most
right it was about three grand to put everything together they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car
yeah you've got to you crack the steering column then you pull the there's a pin in there that you can pull on these gm cars and you can start it up basically pretty easily
well after i found mine i had to i had this
so deanna where do you like to fish
um-hum
um-hum
oh great
uh-huh
what do you what do you use for bait for crappie and bass
um-hum
um-hum
i've never used crickets before do you use them live
you put the hooks through their little back and they just jump around under the water
and what are crickets good for
brim um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
oh just a minute i got to see who that is
oh okay
are they are they big ones
um-hum
yeah i think you have to go deep for those don't you though
don't they kind of just kind of scavenge along the bottom of wherever they are
yeah what kind of a boat do y'all have
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah well we don't have a boat we usually fish off the shore or off the dock and my i've got a son that's a senior in high school and he just loves he loves fishing i don't have the patience that he does
you know it's sitting there on the dock and you go a hour and nothing's happened he says no dad i know they're down there let's not go i know they're down there and they're and they're gonna bite anytime and
he got into a place where we were in there where there was a bunch of sand bass schooling and my goodness
he was throwing this was one day last summer and he every as often as he could throw that hook out there he'd get one but we don't deplete the fish population because we pull them up and look at them admire them and take them off and throw them back
although he went somewhere with some friends last week and fished for catfish
and got them and i think it's the first time that he's ever that he's actually prepared and ate what they caught he and some friends of his the first time they've ever done anything but throw them back
but we you know we started with just rudimentary things like worms and night crawlers and gone to minnows and can catch just a lot of sandies or even catfish with minnows
and we fish at lake texoma
and then and then just kind of stop there on the way by and get the and get the and get minnows and
it's pretty lot of fun except i say you got to have a lot of patience because some days it doesn't seem like anything's down there at all
and then other days
you can pull them in with some degree of regularity it seems as the summer comes when it gets warm and you have calm days without a lot of wind they seem to be far more prevalent
no
yeah
oh sure
yeah
throw them back and let them get bigger so you can come get them next year yeah
but you know at texoma it's such a big lake and we don't have a boat but we're on the dock and people come in there's a lot of sandy islands out in the middle of texoma
and they go out and fish around there and people come in with these ice chests just full of you know twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen inch long fish
oh yeah i know they are i used to have one that we used to ski behind
and before our children came along my wife and i used to ski all the time then when the and we kept it on it was an eighteen footer it was kind of big to haul over the road so we kept it at a lake tied up
gigantic compared to what use we were getting out of it
so i went and sold it and never bought again and it's too bad now the kids are teenagers they want they'd love to get out there and learn to ski and do the boating and fishing again so probably do something like that
do you do you camp at the lake a lot
but not in the summer
oh okay
um-hum
oh
um-hum where is toledo bend
oh okay it's on that side it's on the east side what's the nearest big city
it's huge yeah and i was i is it out like near tyler or texarkana or parish
oh okay exactly half way between shreveport and dallas how long does it take you to get there from shreveport
do you work in shreveport or go to school or what
oh what are you majoring in
oh my goodness i have been on the lsu campus once i took a recruiting trip for ti there about eight or nine years ago
and i was oh i was ever so impressed with the campus in fact it was a two day trip and between appointments i got a chance to walk around and see it
and what a what a fabulous darn school it was i was just really impressed with it
and i know it's getting off the subject a little bit but i do you follow a lot of the sports at lsu
okay well we're very strong women's basketball team fans
so we follow your basketball team your women's basketball team a lot and
yeah oh of course they are one of the best they didn't do as well this year but we saw them we went down to austin last year and saw them beat the longhorns in the regionals
uh-huh
and what do you plan on doing when you get out
oh gee what a deal on like on love boat huh
hey that's a neat thing
uh-huh
are you then plan on maybe getting an advanced degree somewhere
oh at lsu you gonna stay there
oh
um-hum
what would it take about thirty hours or something like that thirty two thirty six
okay so that would be two long semesters and a summer maybe huh
yeah okay
oh sure i think i think the best thing to do is i got two masters degrees but they both came years after my bachelor's degree
and if i had to do it all over again i would do what you're planning to do like continue
it is it is very hard to go back and
and actually the academic part isn't bad when your when you resume because it seems that things come easier because you're more mature and you've got all your life experiences and i thought the academic part would be harder but it really isn't
it because i don't know i think the maturity factor overcomes the fact that you've had a gap
but nevertheless it's so much it's so hard to get back to it and it's so much easier while you've got your academic juices flowing
i have my first one's in my bachelor's in chemistry and my master's in physics and in management quality management i've been in quality management with ti and engineering management and
a month or so since i've been to the movies
course my favorite now is dances with wolves
silence of the lan of the lambs was good
uh-huh
i guess it's a mystery you'd call it it's with jodie foster
and it
it's pretty good another one that i think i really liked was the fisher king
right
how about you what are you
yes
right that was that was an excellent movie have you seen dances with wolves
that what'd you think of it
i don't think i can see it enough times
i thought so
have you seen the fisher king
it you
you know i guess it really isn't for everybody it's pretty deep and
philosophical
but i thought it had a wonderful message to it it's kind you came out
but when you first came out you weren't real sure
haven't seen that
oh yes i did yes i did
the nanny type
housekeeper uh-huh
i saw one the other day that was a kiss before dying
um-hum i had not heard about it when it was on the movies but was out on video
and it's with sean young
and it's a it's a mystery it was very predictable i mean you knew you knew when the murder was gonna happen or something but it was still so well done
that it was enjoyable
oh i like the
i think it's called the
razor's edge
no the jagged edge the jagged edge
with
health care
number one
dental and medical yes
yes i'm fortunate in that i was able to take early retirement from my company last year
and being able to do that i was able to keep my health insurance that the company pays for which and i had to pick up my own life insurance
and my wife who works at the same company was able to add me to the dental insurance
so i was really fortunate i really was
i think they will as long as they can but the problem
obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight
it is very much so it's a billion dollar problem you know every year
our company had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they're having to pick up you know more of the health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the co-payments are going up
and i'm concerned that's just you know the beginning of it
oh yeah
that's a problem too yeah
um-hum right
um-hum right
oh i
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum well actually excuse me our dental insurance you know it's good it's certainly better than nothing it's not you know it's not super you
for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger guy so you probably don't have it you know i do have some dental problems and it's very expensive
and if your blessed with you know good dental
situation you are extremely lucky you really are i've had a lot of problems i still have some ongoing problems mainly because back when i was growing up
you know we didn't know about fluoride i was raised in a small rural town in oklahoma you only went to the dentist when your tooth actually began to hurt you know there was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then
so the younger people you know are really better shaped than people of my generation or for the most part
but dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as health insurance you know if i had to rank them
oh gosh that's the general you know you know you almost need to know the family situation you know and you know number of kids fortunately
i have two children and they're both grown and are covered you know under their own plans so i don't i don't have medical you know expenses for them per say
i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage
now we
that's right that's right and also we i say we i'm retired from texas instruments and they're just they're like most everybody you can't just
you don't drop into a hospital and demand you know a thousand dollars worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but there's only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go
but there's only approved health care centers you know that they will pay you know the maximum amount
if you choose to go you know you pick up the difference according to the emergency it doesn't make any difference you can you know you can go wherever you need to go
also they were doing for a long time they were doing the company was paying for second opinions
to doctors but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective
right so they have dropped the second opinion type thing but before you allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital you really there's a telephone number that you have to call you know and they will tell you exactly you know what they will pay for it
and if you yeah if you want to so at least you know you wouldn't have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself
um-hum
absolutely you need about even probably
absolutely do you have a family
i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do
but i would really check that out because i'm concerned in coming years it's going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks
um-hum right
that's right
um-hum
right
yeah absolutely
you know some companies can't even afford any longer you know to carry the insurance they're just dropping it you know they don't have any choice it's bankrupting them
but i'm i am and very fortunate in that i was able to retire you know with health benefits
oh absolutely
okay you take care of yourself good luck to you thank you bye-bye
oh my
ooh you've been to europe
that's wonderful i'm envious
that's memories you'll never ever have again probably
hum-um
what was your favorite country
italy huh
well
that was probably before we were the ugly americans too
golly
yeah
wow
who'd you go with
why don't we
well i teach literature and at
the high school level and consequently i teach all about these wonderful places in europe and in england especially and canterbury cathedral and you know all of these places and
and never seen them somehow now that doesn't seem fair
gee
of all the places you visited then what is your one spot
for a vacation that you would love to go back to
why is that
um-hum
right
isn't that the truth
did you go to germany
oh my goodness
um-hum
oh i don't know
but you know i have the radio wake me up in the morning so i get i get some headlines there
i read the usenet news
really i'm not getting the good quality news that i want
and i bought a tv last year
but i don't really watch it
i don't get any in depth stuff
oh crossfire yeah i saw that a couple of times
who did they have i've my friends who watch cnn all the time they like knew these guys
yeah i saw the
mclaughlin had a similar type of a program on
i guess buchanan retired from that also
that that's a good show i like that one a lot
yeah it's on i guess it was on pbs for a while
probably still is
yeah
yeah you know macneil lehrer or npr usually have some decent in depth stuff
headlines
oh god i hate that
yeah we have you know the local newspaper is pretty weak
but
and i once in a every once in a while like every six months or every three months i read the times
the times is pretty good
well not only that but it's so little there's no background
you know i rely a lot to tell you the truth on you know when i was growing up i learned geography i'd read the times a lot so you know and every
day there'd be an article on some country you know what's doing in that country this week
you know because there's enough countries that you know there'd be something interesting happening
pretty much and i got a pretty good feel for
you know and that and taking some economics classes you get a pretty good feel for how the world works
so when you hear a story then you say well what aren't they telling you
and then you start conjecturing and that's where i hate i hate it because you know i can guess what's happening but i don't know the real truth
and they just they leave out so much
huh you can stop wondering
they don't care
yes
okay
oh well that's good because i'm a singer
in high school and college it was classical lately it's been more contemporary country
well
it's pretty neat they do it at a lot of different clubs
like dave and buster's and
oh little country bars and stuff
uh-huh yeah they've got a little tv monitor on the stage most places do
the person singing sees the monitor and most places have a big screen behind you so that everybody can see the words yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah it's you some of the places do karaoke like once or twice a week and then they have like there's a country bar or country saloon i used to go to that they have country bands most of the rest of the week
it's pretty neat i like it
uh-huh um-hum
oh how neat
uh-huh
oh good
hm
yeah
yeah
yeah well i after college i got out got married started or started working got married and i didn't sing for ten years and i just found karaoke last october i guess
and i was just thrilled i loved it it's neat
not really not in not in anything not in anything organized no
periodically if we go to like
a christmas eve services where they do the part of messiah or something like that but that was about it but back in high school i was more of a classical kind of stuff through wagner and chopin and schubert and
uh-huh
they yeah that's i found a lot of stuff like anne murray she i have to that's one thing neat about karaoke you can change pitches i mean you can change the keys
and her stuff i normally have to take up at least a step if not a step and a half
i don't know
oh okay
no my i'm in a sorority but we decided not to do it for the sorority my boss his wife is one of the
oh now that's a neat idea
that's
wow now that would be a good idea yeah i proposed it for the for i'm in a service or actually it's a social sorority and it's beta sigma phi
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
yes
okay
oh
um-hum
ooh
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh gosh
um-hum
huh i'd never thought about that being a cause i have to dust a lot as well
yeah
um-hum
my goodness
um-hum
um-hum
that's kind of the way dallas is we're so flat and open and i live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation trees it was all cotton fields so
we don't have that advantage and ours i think is primarily cars where we don't carpool like we should
an airport i work in a building i'm nineteen floors up and i look out toward dfw international and there's just an awful brown haze all the time
and i can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport
um-hum
yes
um-hum
um-hum want to meet my own schedule those are the arguments we hear
um-hum
um-hum
but we're paying for it
um-hum
you can really see it i had a chance to go to bolivia a couple years ago and of course there's no industry
very little trash they don't even have that much that they burn because they consume everything down to the thread and it amazed me i just had totally forgotten how
right
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
you must be les
so am i yes what a coincidence
yeah i know what family home evening's all about
um-hum
right and then the family home evening too
right
well that's good
how many children do you have
two what do you have
five and four
i have two daughters
my oldest is four and my youngest is about to turn three
two girls
yes we've my well when we first got married my wife worked for a year
then we decided to have kids
and she got pregnant and then
we decided she would stay home with the kids
we would make that sacrifice it is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one
and we made that decision
and so after she had the first baby she stayed home
and we had a second baby and she's still at home
and so
you know at work a lot of people are you know i think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our in our
world we live in most of them continue to work if they have kids
i only have one other person i know in my in my group here that works where the wife stays home
and that's because of religious values as well they're baptists and they and they think that's important
but everybody else works and they drop their kids off at day care and leave them and
i don't know i just don't want i just don't want strangers raising my children
right
anything goes when mom's on the phone
um-hum
right
right
right
with all the yard work and things like that
um-hum
um-hum
right we feel that you know just spending time together
you don't necessarily have to be doing anything you know that costs money
or you know that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that it's just the kids like to being together as a family
like last saturday we went had some errands to run and so we took the kids and
and we went by the farmers market down in down there in garland
and they had a blast running around the farmers market looking at all the you know the food and tasting all the free samples
they were giving out and they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet you know and they liked that and
then on the way home we drove by the local high school and there happened to be an fa faa future fa future farmers of america ffa
going on there and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything you know all out in this in the in this schoolyard there so we just said hey let's stop and
and the kids got to go around and you know see pigs and animals and things like that and
and for them that's wonderful you know they thought it was the greatest fun you know and it didn't cost any money
and you don't have quite as much money when the wife doesn't work
right
um-hum
right
right oh definitely motherhood is devalued in this society if you're stay home and you're a mother it's like
what a waste people think you know you should be fulfilling yourself and a mother isn't an important
important thing as having a career and that should be first and children second but
no
right
at this point it's not to say that some day you won't go back to work my mother's a school teacher and
and when we started having kids she had to work for a little while but then she just started substituting
so she would just substitute once or twice a week you know just for that little extra money
when we were in school then we would just come home and just be you know go to a neighbor's house for an hour then she'd be home but she wouldn't do that every day
but now that my
my youngest sister's at byu now and so they have no one at home she's back teaching school full time now again
so if you know it's not it's just a temporary thing
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah you it's hard sometimes at work because you know people say oh we're taking a cruise we're going here we're going there you know because they have a lot more money
and a lot of them decide just not to have children it's amazing they either have one or none
and the one person i know that has one they feel guilty she has this continual guilt trip that she's not doing the right thing and so
on weekends she would you know
spend all of their time with their kids and spend lots of lots and lots of money basically i think they really spoil the child to try to overcompensate for their guilt feelings
and they don't want to have anymore children because they just don't think you know
that she doesn't think she could be a mother at home that's not her bag so she just doesn't think she could
you know the guilt feelings she can't deal with it anymore so
you know
um-hum yeah my wife
likes staying home
she works at home some though
the place she works with worked with before worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home
part time
and so that it's kind of a seasonal thing three times a year she's really busy doing certain things based on that kind of business but the rest of the time she's free
she likes to sew and do crafts and things like that
so she enjoys staying at home but the money part of it is not as rewarding obviously but
there's different rewards you know different kinds of rewards
right and you really have to make a quite a bit of money the wife doesn't make it worth it with the cost of day care
i know there's you know
when you adjust your income for what you put out for day care you know you're only making like five
donna hi i'm lynn randall
yes
sure that'd be just fine we might as well go ahead
yeah you have to you have to push the button uh-huh push one
did you yet push the button oh okay no that's it
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i do cross stitch also
in fact i was just sitting here getting ready to start some things so i've done it for a number of years and so that is one of my favorite things to do also i find it very relaxing and so like if i
you know if i haven't done it for a while i like to have a i just like to have a project going because i think it it's just a real good thing to have
uh-huh
uh-huh
now do you think he's reasonable in terms of prices
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
sure
so is it is it so
well i'm glad to know that
okay so it's closer to the railroad tracks then from nooks and crannies okay
okay
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yes uh-huh
it's been closed a couple of years so really in my now i didn't i in fact i was just there yesterday but i didn't go across the street i saw that there's a place across the street i didn't go in to that place but i generally buy most of my things in nooks and crannies uh-huh
yeah
yeah well it depends on what i'm doing i tend to see i make up most of my own things and so
in fact i make up almost everything i do now i used to do you know kits and all or i'd use books but i tend not to do that much anymore
so it depends on what i'm doing as to what i use i recently did one on linen and that's the first time
the house i live in is fairly typical of the area it's one that my wife and i designed ourselves
well in texas we don't have basements very often i'm surprised you do in utah
so it's cold
ah
it is it air-conditioned
so you're cool enough you don't need the air-conditioning
well in texas you can't hardly live without it
yeah we designed our house so the western exposure has a minimum number of windows so that the air-conditioning bill will be cheaper
no actually it we just started and we didn't like any of the houses we saw built they tended to have at the time we were building
very large bathrooms which i consider a waste of space since you spend so little time in the bathroom
and also too much hall space we saw a home plan in better homes and gardens about five years before we built this house that we liked
except we wanted it a little bigger than it had two bedrooms that you could add on another bedroom
and we wanted it arranged slightly differently
i think if you looked at the floor plan now you probably wouldn't recognize where we started from
but my wife likes a lot of cabinets in the kitchen and the original architect tried to talk us out of that and thank goodness we didn't let him talk us out of that
and we wanted an entry way so that the living room
did not have to be walked through
the previous place we had lived in you always walked through the living room to get any place in the house and it was a traffic flow problem all the time
so we have an entry way and i spend quite a little time in both when i was working and also even now retired
in the study where i have a computer so we wanted a separate study and we have that
and it has three bedrooms and we wanted it since our son we raised my wife's sister as our daughter so in effect we had two children but
we wanted it so that we could leave the house to them when they had friends over and the normal noise that goes with such things so we have the
master bedroom is arranged so that it is basically a separate apartment in itself it has its own bath has its own patio porch type thing sliding doors and a very large room with
a tv set so you could live back there by itself if you wanted to
oh that's i don't know with our previous house didn't have it and
yeah my wife does also
um-hum
right
a little bit during the school year we're
definitely expected to wear hosiery and you know things like that although we can wear slacks
during the school year and of course that's a good idea because
i do sit on very low chairs to read stories to kindergartners and
you know so it's pretty important to i also like very much the new split skirts
you know because then you've
oh that's oh that's true the old culottes that's right but those are just real comfortable and
the only
no i think it needs to be longer probably if it's split it varies though between the from one principal to another
there are some like
some principals insist that you not wear anklet type shorts
i mean socks
that you have to wear you know hose but i know of other schools
where they wear you know anklets and
um-hum
um-hum
do you wear suits very much
um-hum
yeah right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
i am too and i
i've been here seventeen years
but i'm from
but i'm from illinois
that's right that's right
that's right
right all right that really is nice
i i'm kind of a pack rat especially when it comes to clothes
and i mean i still have some sweaters that i had you know from before i moved down here things that were wool or just you know really nice things and
and really very seldom get to wear them and should certainly get rid of probably all of them
but like i said i'm kind of a
at the beginning of the winter
yeah
are you from here then
um-hum
well the thing is that you know it does get cold but it's just such a short season you know and you just
can't wear that much
oh how nice
rabbit
huh where have you found them
but they carry them at dillard's
hum i'll have to look at those that sounds interesting
um-hum well you mentioned that you liked the long skirts and i really do too i just i don't know i'm really comfortable in
um-hum
um-hum i like that too
that's real good very well
for work
well you work year round right yeah
um-hum
um-hum that's true
yeah that's true well i have more summer stuff i guess
for that kind of casual because
i go back to illinois and visit my folks for a week and then we go out to the east coast to visit my husband's
mom and family and we usually go to the beach while we're out there so
in fact i was thinking this summer that since i'm doing summer school i haven't
worn very many of those things but i was thinking oh well i got to get them all together so
to take them on our trip
well i took i went through my closet this spring and i
i took some stuff out
to keep them because they're nice and so i thought well i'll put them in there and then maybe i'll feel so bad that i can't wear them now
and i'll do something about it
but so far
oh that's funny
yeah that's right
ooh yeah you'll be glad believe me oh because
oh
it's just unreal the time though that it really gets the worst is
is when the kids get
old enough that they really care what they're wearing
my kids are twelve and fifteen
and you know they're both boys so they're probably not as picky as if they were girls but
i mean i could get away with
you know with
it not costing nearly as much you know when they were littler because
anything was fine but you know now it has to be a certain kind of
certain kind of jeans and the shoes are just about the worst
gee my son just came out the other day and he's his
what is it i think they're reebok
whatever my other son has nike airs at the moment but these reeboks
and i was thinking he bought them in march
it was early march he bought them and they are demolished
i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them
the inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out i mean that's how worn out they are
and they i bought them on a wonderful sale at mervyn's they must have been thirty five or so percent off they cost sixty dollars
on that much of a sale
and my husband and i were just talking you know it's
i mean we're talking minimum of three of those a year
that's a hundred and eighty dollars a year for his tennis shoes
you know and my husband
oh it's just awful and my husband bought i mean this year he bought a pair of really good you know work leather nice
men's dress shoes and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or you know something like that and you know he said i felt terrible spending that amount of money on this pair of shoes he said
and he's i mean we're talking a just a piece of rag
so anyway
probably on friday nights full house it's a family comedy
how about you
really
uh-huh how about you do you have a favorite one
uh-huh
uh-huh so do you like comedies mostly or
uh-huh what kind of sports
uh-huh it's just whatever's in season at the time
uh-huh huh yeah i mostly like you know comedies and movies you know movies on cable that aren't interrupted i guess
yeah i have cinemax and the movie channel i guess
yeah i mean how much tv do you normally watch
yeah that that's about what i do you know like around nine or so in the evening i go
uh-huh um-hum
right exactly
uh-huh but then the thing on cable is that like you'll if you like watch you'll see that movies are repeated so often
um-hum
hum so you're not familiar with or with full house right
well it's about like a widowed father who has three girls and he has two other guys that live with him and they're all raising like the three daughters and it yeah but it's really interesting and it's really funny i enjoy it
um-hum
uh-huh well and i have when harry met sally on cable on
yeah it's a really good movie
i guess the other thing i like is like the cosby show i like that on thursday nights
really
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum hum
hum
and that's really about it i guess
uh-huh yeah i can remember what was that i spy or whatever that he was in
yeah i
um-hum i like that
right and i always liked that yeah that cartoon i always liked that um-hum
not really that much lately i used
uh-huh oh no you like that one huh
uh-huh i never even saw the movie or the second one i guess
uh-huh
yeah
oh really i like more of the cartoons that were on when i was younger like bugs bunny and you know porky
oh i never really liked him no
oh i like that uh-huh
oh really
uh-huh
yeah and it's interesting from the perspective of his perspective i guess
um-hum i'm a little bit younger i was like what i was born in sixty three so i was i'm little bit younger
no not really
uh-huh
on occasion i'm usually not home on you know sunday evenings but on occasion i do and 20/20
really i've never seen that one
well i'm not normally home during when talk shows are on
um-hum
so the only time i ever catch anything is if i come home a little bit home early from work and see oprah because she's on at four
uh-huh but you know they tend to arrange though the topics seem to go like in a cycle and it seems like on everyone's show they have the same topic like within a certain range of time
at least i've seen notice not that i see them that often but from what i hear people telling me
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
hum
um-hum
exactly
hum
well you know i even like entertainment tonight with you know i like that you learn a little bit about the stars' lives you know so
yeah um-hum
oh i definitely don't watch those
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh well that'll give you
a lot of entertainment
um-hum
oh that i don't i don't really get into watching sports on tv i'd rather be there in person i guess but if you can't be there in person i guess seeing it on tv is the next best thing
uh-huh
well i guess i guess you would um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh that's a benefit
um-hum
oh really
no i haven't either i haven't either and i do want to see that
oh sure it was nice talking to you
well i i'm not really certain how i i'm not certain that it does a lot of good i mean that it ends up ends up effectively
avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment
penalties yet on the other hand i don't know i mean there's things that seems like it's the right thing to do now
you know i mean somebody as serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns you know fifty children in a school yard you kind of
i don't know
what about yourself
effective punishments and they're extremely severe
i you know i think to a certain degree the reason that it doesn't serve as a deterrent may be because
you never know if it's gonna be applied
and you know and here with our court system and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can
you can kind of
always count on the fact you know or there's a good chance you're gonna get off and so
uh-huh
yeah some people
yeah
to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is extremely high i mean something i was amazed at a per year it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year
to keep people in jail you know i mean that's sort of a sort of a crass perspective i mean on the usage of capital punishment but on the other hand
you know i don't know if it's a crime that's that serious that they're really never gonna be out of jail
oh i know i mean you can't it doesn't taking one more life doesn't get you know get things back the way they were right yeah i don't know i don't i really don't know i'm in texas
no i'm in austin
where are you where are you calling from
oh i see uh-huh
yeah so
it texas is has is one of the
one of the well i guess there's more and more states that are that are going back to capital punishment texas has had it for a while it's one of the quicker it once it was it was reallowed i think it was outlawed for a while by the by the supreme court i mean or the interpretation of the constitution
and it seems like everybody stopped and then and then once they sort of reallowed it texas was one of the first to actually implement it again
they do it by do it by lethal injection
so you know
i'm originally from kansas and in kansas also they
they almost immediately put back capital punishment and there they do it by hanging
still right they have
i still remember the movie in cold blood
i don't know if you've ever i'm sure you're familiar with it but have you seen the movie
yeah the way
it's fairly impressive to watch them you know walk into the room with gallows it's a kind of a barn like structure
is that right are you there in school yeah uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
has a yeah has a real bullet and the rest of them have blanks
as long as you're sort of safely removed from it seems not so not so bad i guess but
well most of the stuff up until now in the recent months i don't have any problem with
i mean it's you know it
no i agree with that as far as the as far as the mess that's developing as a result
and
i just i heard a comment on the radio this morning that you know it gets to a point where
if enough people are going to be slaughtered over there over the
the internal problems somebody may step in again but i really think it's a un issue
at that point because it is internal
uh-huh
that's right that's right
that's absolutely right
um-hum
that's right
i mean these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time some of them have been going on for tens of years if i understand it right in places like the sudan and
yeah
that's right
yeah that's absolutely right
yeah
that's absolutely right
yeah it was just you know it was it's a very opportune moment for them to try you know you
oh yeah
um-hum
yeah i agree
yeah and you know and it there are many of them there's no doubt about it
um-hum
and so many of the so many of the conflicts
really don't have a basis in politics or human rights or anything like that it
it's religious based and you know by self-proclamation this is a holy war and it is right and then we go on from there
yeah it it's a mess it it's there's no doubt about it and
that's right
um-hum
absolutely
um-hum
you bet
you bet well yeah because there's no
you know there there's a complete different set of values there's different value placed on human life and right down the list you know possessions and everything else and
what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases and it's
okay
yeah
yeah
um-hum
i believe it
yeah i can i can i can believe that yeah i don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means but
that's probably true
uh-huh
no that's a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field
but
yeah
that's right
uh-huh absolutely
absolutely
that's right yes
right that's an everyday occurrence
um-hum
i agree yeah it's
there is there is it's an overall problem in this country understanding foreign cultures or even accepting them
and it bites us over and over again the
um-hum
that's right
that's right
um-hum
absolutely
well they're coming from various places and a lot of them are going back there
okay
i see
yeah
right
sure okay
um-hum
absolutely
that's right
yeah you know every the country's got a problem with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that and the long range views are just kind of become a thing of the past
and
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
no absolutely
okay
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
absolutely
that's right
that's absolutely right yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah the unfortunately the way the
the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get something in your hands it it's obsolete and
we're we fight that battle every day here at work
um-hum
that's right
that's right
okay yeah
oh okay
yeah well that that's the key you know whatever works for you and
if it does the job then that's what you need
uh-huh
well my
i guess sports i'm don't play as much sports as i used to because i'm too old for it now
but i still play golf
i like to bowl although i hadn't bowled in quite a while
but i guess my main exercise right now is probably golf
this last tournament i was in i walked nine holes and almost dropped so i shared a cart
yeah especially on a real hilly course
yeah
oh
they have a real nice health club there at ti lewisville racquetball courts and hand ball courts and
it's a real nice facility i just haven't taken advantage of it yet though
no not really
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i've i wish they'd split that bowling season up into
three seasons
right now they have a real short season and a real long season
the summer league is just too long
yeah
yeah
yeah there's hardly no open alleys anymore it's all
all taken up
yeah
but
also ti has some good some good jogging tracks
every once in a while i'm sitting there eating lunch i'll look out and see people jogging
i guess on their lunch hour
yeah
yeah
yeah
i guess i would love to play basketball but
but i don't i don't think i'd have the wind for that i guess of all the sports that probably gives you more exercise than any sport there is
yeah
yeah
but
yeah
yeah i
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
you might have to go to those old old-timey high top tennis shoes that they used to wear
yeah
yeah
tight enough to really support your ankle
yeah
yeah
yeah
only bad thing about an ace bandage if you wrap it tight enough so that really supports your ankle it's going to cut off the blood
yeah
yeah
yeah
but
that's about it as far as exercise
unless you call pushing yourself away from the table more exercise
yeah well i was cooking me a grilled cheese
yeah cheese is bad for you i know
yeah
yeah
yeah i heard about it
yeah i think it it's all in the metabolism of the
yeah
yeah
well that's the same with me i do both and my blood pressure is i think it was the last time i took it was a hundred and hundred and ten over seventy or something like that
yeah
yeah
yeah
no if you didn't eat if you knocked off everything that they say is not good for you to eat you'd be just about down to bread and water
yeah it would have to be a diet bread
well it's been nice talking with you
okay you too
bye-bye
and i think that really what it means to me is being outdoors in a sort of a wilderness environment and being able to enjoy nature
what does it mean to you
there are a number of environmental cabins near where we live that offer some sort of dwelling some sort of security from the elements but there's no electricity no heat no water
oh yeah
state park system i think is probably what supports a lot of those they're state as opposed to county facilities
california
oh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i see
actually in the cabins so it's like a sink
um-hum
in texas what are the camp parks like if you go tent camping are you near a real wooded area or does it tend to be more plains
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh well what's it like camping with your son when he was young
uh-huh
oh wow
that's a pretty area
uh-huh
uh-huh
i bet it was for them too it's been an experience with our daughter who's turning two in a couple of days because she was probably six months old the first time and we had kind of missed camping
little kid so it's been kind of fun trying to adjust our routine and doing it with her as she grows up
which is what your kids have done
right and she's fairly cautious so we're not too concerned about her running into the poison ivy or whatever
exactly
staying close to the camp ground
oh wow cool
right well i guess
so i pretty much read the paper
yeah i catch the news sometimes but we're so busy usually i just grab the paper at work
we and we get the really local papers here so can find out what the school board's doing and things like that
yeah i like grab the paper like to see how my stock is doing and things like that because i don't always call my broker and things
but actually now that i think of it the thing the place where i get most of my information is i have an hour commute in the morning and in the afternoon
so we listen to npr a lot and we hear we listen to morning edition in the morning and fresh air and all things considered in the afternoon
so and even if we're not listening to the feature stories we certainly tune in at the top of the hour because you got about six minutes of good news and
yeah i'd like to get you know things little a little more from the horse's mouth although i dislike the way that the media for instance distorting the campaigns like oh big surprise clinton won in the south you know
you know this must mean he's the frontrunner now why because you know all of his region votes on one day
but you know i find especially npr is fairly unbiased you know i use to watch cnn a lot when i got cable
because they also seem to not lean one way or the other in their reporting
our local papers like the boston globe you know where you we have you know you've got the boston globe which is extreme in one way and the manchester union leader which like supports buchanan and things
so between the two of them you know it's not a lot of and then you've got the boston phoenix weekly with the nine hundred ads in the back you know but other than that there just isn't a lot of you know unbiased local print reporting
yeah and i don't even bother with local news because it's like you know i'm a pilot so i'm aware of how they misrepresent you know it's like a guy would do a gears up landing and it'd be there was a crash landing today and our camera crew was there
you know they or and then of course on sweeps it's how you can get cancer from eating common foods but we're not going to tell you during the thirty second spot you know tune in for a twenty seven part report over the next three weeks
i really think that
you know you have to go to some place like npr that doesn't have a vested interest in you know they don't really care about you know getting two hundred thousand people to watch their shows because they're funded by people who do want to hear this kind of news
and the other nice thing about my local npr station is they also got monitor radio and the bbc
then in the afternoon you get the npr's talk show and then you've got fresh air at four all things considered till seven then you get market place then they give you bbc again
so it's really you know they they've got a bunch of classical music in the afternoon but other than that it's just straight news reporting from about four different sources
and you know it's kind of neat to see how the bbc reports things differently you know they've got a much different view like reporting south africa and the middle east
i find that npr and the bbc has a much more global view than like abc or one of the us ones
but you know because you know i find that a the american electronic media is so ethnocentric
where
you know they don't realize for instance that there's a recession happening in the rest of the world too it's not just us lucky people
so you know that's pretty much where i get my information from and you know i'll glance through the boston globe to get the local news there and i'll glance through the like the milford cabinet the national telegraph to get the really local news
yeah it's like the globe gives you like regional news and boston news
like my fiance is telling me the globe sucks
and then you get like you know the telegraph and the cabinet is giving you like how your high school football team did and what's being voted on and you know we got our picture in the in the in the cabinet because we went to the school board meeting
so you know that that's the kind of level of stuff you get there so you get a real diversity of coverage
oh okay
uh-huh
she can
well i work i'm a cpa and i do contract work
it's kind of weird because before i used to work you know full time and it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day just about
it's very nice i
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah well i imagine that where you live you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year
not really
oh is that right
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
right
right
yeah
well down here it's sunny most of the time and
usually warm i mean we've had a few cool days this month but not anything i'm sure compared to what you've had so far so i mean people are still wearing shorts and
and usually around halloween it starts getting cooler so you start you know breaking out a coat
no
no never wore slacks it was
not no not with what i did most people didn't sometimes like the secretaries might
but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much and i really you know there's some nice pantsuits out and i wouldn't have minded you know wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold
uh-huh
but no we usually you know skirt and skirt and blouse or suit or dress is what you see down here so it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants
no one no one can see me unless i'm you know
right
yeah
okay well i guess i can tell you that tonight is murphy brown that's the one i don't miss and i don't know if you've seen that that's with candace bergen
yeah
really
um-hum
oh jeez
uh-huh
i'd say that's the only one i don't miss or i try not to miss that one and cheers on thursdays
uh-huh
yeah i like the lessons it's a good it's got a lot of good morals to it so i enjoy that one
oh that's right coach yes that's another one that i try not to miss although it use to be better i don't know it seems well
yeah i was going to say i haven't seen the past couple episodes i think the last one i really saw was when he broke up with christine
uh-huh
oh really
really
uh-huh
i know excuse me just a minute i think katy
ten
so let's see i was trying to think of i don't think i've ever watched any soap operas i my mom used to watch young and the restless but i don't i don't watch them
she oh gosh she would run the tape player from the minute she went to go do her aerobics and she used to do like filing at the hospital
and i think she did some work at a thrift store so as long as she was gone for about four hours well maybe three she would tape soap operas
and she would watch them at night when she came home
i know he was saying he was so sick of soap operas because i guess for about four years now she you know he'll come home from work and there she'll be watching soap operas yeah
um-hum
yeah well she's really she's really into it i guess but i never have gotten used to well i just really never have been home i think during that time
uh-huh
no
uh-huh
right really
and i've never watched that i going to have to watch that sometime
uh-huh
yeah
yeah they everything starts at eight and then it goes through ten and i don't think johnny carson comes on until like eleven
so everything really that's what's really cut into my tv watching is the time that everything comes on since it's all shifted back an hour i just i don't really have time to stay up late and since i have to get up so early to go to classes
i can't stay up past ten thirty i'm falling asleep anyway so i miss most everything anyway
but let's see
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i've never seen it what is it is it like a version of the dating game or huh
oh god
uh-huh
that is terrible and the other person has to hear it
oh
uh-huh oh gosh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh gosh i was going to say i never heard of that one the love connection
right now they've got that katherine hepburn one where she's touring all the gardens of europe i of course have missed the first series of that but that's about the only thing that i really catch on pbs
and we used to get arts and entertainment in san antonio and i we get a little bit of the good ones here but we used to try and catch some of the stuff they had on there
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well we used to watch cnn because that was the only thing on really early that i could an update on all the news but with the war coverage i had it with reporters
and the coverage and so after a while i just turned it off i said i can't take it any more i just can't
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i never knew that i never even thought that they would have cnn on in taiwan
i guess that keeps anybody that's traveling that's american over there you'd think that they'd put it on in chinese or translate it in chinese
huh
huh
i know that i didn't much
uh-huh
oh
oh golly
yeah because i can't remember where i've seen clips of that but they were showing highlights of it and stuff and i was thinking who'd think this is really up my alley for half an hour you know if i'm going to spend my time but it was
a lot of borderline jokes
yeah
were you sailboating
just motorboat's all we
nacogdoches
that's between houston and dallas
it's the oldest town in texas yeah we have lake sam rayburn out here and lake nacogdoches so we do a lot of boating on
yeah
yeah
um-hum lot of fishing going on up here
it's well you ever heard of lufkin
houston
let me see houston's north
dallas is south
it's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons probably seventies eighties in the afternoon
no i hadn't done any in a lately but that's all i used to have a friend that owned his daddy owned a boat shop and we used to when i was in high school we used to go out
go boating everyday just about
and we had a different boat everyday
i'd like to do some sailing
yeah what do you if you get one like that they have somebody teach you there or they just
yeah
is it pretty easy
yeah
yeah that well that's about all we have
um-hum
i didn't know that
that that'd be something
um-hum
what kind of what lake do y'all
um-hum
ooh
yeah
i build transformers
yeah
no it's for cooper industries
yeah
well they have a you know worldwide but
well all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that
it's real nice living here all my life
yep
oh it's oklahoma's nothing like it
where do you live
oh
oh
oh my word
yeah oh well we've had unseasonably warm weather here in texas we
last week if it was i believe it was monday or tuesday we had ninety four degrees
uh-huh yep
i grew up in wyoming so i you know we had
i didn't mind the heat then
the summer time the summer's here get real hot and i have a hard time with those but i get use to them you just kind of stay indoors
this time of year you know sixties and you know stuff like that so
today i think it's about sixty five today here something like that so
uh-huh
yeah it's
yeah my husband's outside in a short sleeve shirt right now working in the garden and we've planted our garden
and
yeah we've been you know we've been working in the yard and our peach tree's blooming so we have very warm weather here right now compared to what you're having
i grew up in the you know i grew up in wyoming i remember ice storms and
we get ice storms here but we haven't had one you know in a long time but
the lowest temperature that it gets here
in the winter time this winter we had some temperatures get below zero
and then with the wind chill it got lower but that was
it was you know it doesn't you know it was real unusual
so
hum
hum are people going to work around there in this
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
you know when we get snow and ice here it just shuts down the city
yeah because nobody knows how to drive in it so when you get i mean
here they start even forecast the weather you know it's gonna be an ice storm tomorrow
they'll come before the ten clock news they've already got schools calling in saying they've canceled
it's beautiful the next day i mean the weather here is so unpredictable you know i don't even put much stock in the weather reports anymore because they're hardly ever
accurate
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
yeah they get a little bit of rain here and they suspect it's going to freeze and the sand trucks are out
yeah because we have you know
it gets even in a rainstorm here that roads get so slick
you know it's no not even cold weather but just rain because the roads get so oily
that
we've had you know twelve car pile ups and stuff on the freeways because
people just they don't slow down for nothing around here so
do you want it off
oh no i'm talking to my daughter she wanted her shoe off
sorry
no i was talking my little girl wanted her shoes off
so
uh-huh
you don't even have power back to your house yet
my word
yeah
oh
you need to stock up on batteries then
uh-huh
destroyed
ruined
yeah you have to have some food to eat because the grocery stores probably ran out real fast
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh wow
yeah because it's beautiful here today i haven't gone outside been too busy working inside but
it's beautiful here
oh
yeah it's amazing how it can be so different in one part of the country
because i have family in boston too so um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
but going through it's so much different yeah
uh-huh yeah because his family my husband's family lives in
in anaheim california you know just
couple you know miles from disneyland and
so it's amazing how it's you know it can be cold here and beautiful there
yeah
uh-huh
you could never get use to that kind of weather
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh right
that's how it was in wyoming too you just you know it was always cold then you can you only had two or three months that you could plant a garden
and here we can get three gardens in a year
we can replant three times a year and get stuff so
we've got onions and potatoes and
broccoli and
what else all that kinds of stuff like that planted
myself often desire to exercise often believe i should and rarely do
what sort of regiment do you have
um-hum
yes
yes
um-hum
yes
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
yes right
my goodness you do all of this in fifteen minutes
um-hum
find time for it on a given day and
yes
yes
um-hum
yes
um-hum
yeah
well i whenever i do it i feel good
i mean good that i have done good because it's it seems right and good because it has good effects but it's this maintaining a regular habit that i just can't seem to do
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yes
yes do you do you does your wife participate in any of this or
um-hum
yes
um-hum
but you seemed to have solved that problem without any external
help
yes
what what's on what's this mat i mean in
is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip and sleep on it i mean it's that it's that kind of like half inch of foam or something
yeah
yeah
yeah
reasonable
the company i work for is ti
so i think ti likes to live in the middle of the road
yeah
yeah well i i'm serious i think they really do if they can stay about midway between the companies who have excellent
whatever and the ones who have very poor whatever that's where they want to be right about the middle of the road
uh-huh
yeah and there's no reason to i don't think they consider it to be any particular reason to go out and have the very best in the industry
all they want to do is make it acceptable which probably from a business standpoint is what you want to do i guess
uh-huh yeah
yeah
yeah that's true i'm i have i have used the dental plan several times for myself and also my family so you know i'm glad to have it
but i was there also before the dental plan was in place and we
we stayed on our personnel people at the plant continuously for years literally i mean trying to get a dental plan in place because it had
it had started becoming a thing that a lot of major companies were doing getting dental plans and it took us a long time
yeah
uh-huh yeah
i think they're finally heading that direction you know because they now have some cancer screening test
that they will pay for so and they have also got the you know prentative preventative the well baby stuff which is good
um-hum yeah
um-hum
yeah it's well like i say it it's slowly coming it's i guess it's just
you know with insurance rates and medical cost being what they are i guess it's you know i guess they're really trying to hold the cost down
yeah but it's it sure is hard i mean it's hard on the employee because you know the
the cost are going up and the benefits are coming down you know they true they may be coming down at a slower rate because of the cost management things that they're doing but you know the benefits are coming down
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah
yeah that's true yeah
um-hum and i guess i guess in a way that is the catch you know for the employee but it's also the benefit for the company because they have an amount of money there that i suppose that they invest i don't know exactly what they do with that money
but i'm sure they invest it some way and i'm sure they're making money off of it
um-hum yeah
um-hum
yeah the ti does have some good benefits but like i say i really do believe they strive just to kind of stay in the middle of the road as long as
so that's you know in a way and i'm just wondering you know how far it'll go over the years you know will they single out people who are susceptible to heart disease or overweight or any other
you know recognizable high risk i guess
but you know that's i guess that's i guess that's the way it should be i i'm not sure it is it's different from the way it has been
i don't know i'm i've wondered that myself i'm not a smoker so it's not going to affect me or my family but i you know we we've talked about it at work and wonder about that i guess you're just strictly on your honor i guess
uh-huh yep
well in a way i feel like you know the smokers should have to do that
you know because they are bringing it on themselves even though it is a habit that a lot of them you know may have a problem quitting you know ti has seemingly bent over backwards to help them quit with the stop smoking programs
yeah well like i say since i'm not a smoker i really don't know there are quite a few guys in my i work in a lab environment and there are quite a few guys in there who at one time did smoke and
as a matter of fact all of them have quit but they've all done it on their own none of them enrolled in any kind of program they just i guess just looked at the cold hard facts and just quit cold turkey
yeah
um-hum
i wouldn't be surprised i never had heard a number of how many actually signed up but i do know that they were trying to get people to do it you know which is good because it is
i guess more of a hardship on people who you know who are have been used to smoking in their work area just you know light one up whenever they want to and now they've got to get up and go to a designated area
but that's times are changing you know as it has it's different now than what it was fifteen twenty years ago in the benefits and insurance and the whole works
oh retirement
yeah well i'm still a long way off but you know the retirement and profit sharing now profit sharing is really a sore spot with me because about the time that i hired in was
about two years after i hired on was about the time that the profit sharing plan changed over we went from the old plan to the new plan yeah and
yeah oh yeah so you're you never were familiar with the old plan i don't guess well i you know i never participated in you know in the old plan because i didn't have enough vesting but
uh-huh
it really is it it's it
yeah it's crazy
well
um-hum yeah it's well like i say your account even if you don't draw anything out of it is just not even hardly worth the effort
yeah i'm likewise
you know i think basically ti has without saying it is trying to tell you that hey we're not going to or not going to be able to
take care of you at retirement so we're going to help you do what you can for yourself and you better take advantage of it if you want something to look at
yeah i would hope well you know it is kind of rough on the people who
well i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it'd be great that we went to it
and the one thing though that i think we should do if we go to the metric system then we should do away with the other system and have only the metric system
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
well that's true
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true you're right you're right there's no losing we're losing our culture of our area uh-huh
sure yeah
yeah well i work in a hospital and of course that's all we use and every thing we do is metric you know and you know weights is in kilograms and you know whatever is whatever happens to be the thing that we're measuring it's in metric
and
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
yeah sure right
well one of the things that really i really think it would be sort of weird is the cars the miles per hour instead of having kilometers per hour
cause it it's hard to imagine you know i well i think the problem with us our generation is that nobody even if we did go all the way to the metric system that we're still going to think in terms of how it relates to the other system you know
no matter what
that's right that's right because it's hard to it's just like another language i guess
and when you learn another language i guess what you have to do is try to think in that language and not think in terms of translating it to english you know but
yeah
i think so too and i think that it was pretty much optional wasn't it at the time and
but of course if you didn't have anything available but metrics i think it'd be a little easier on you know
that's right that's right you'd you would just quit thinking you wouldn't worry about how many ounces is this you would just say well how many how many grams is it you know and
yeah
sure yeah and it's like weight you know i weigh about a hundred and sixty five and that's i know somewhere in the neighborhood of seventy something kilograms you know and it's hard to imagine well only seventy something you feel like you don't weigh much you know
well that's true
yeah that's right
it's funny that i guess all that started in england i guess all the system of measurement and now we're still using it and they are gone they've left it you know and they use metrics there
no i've always wanted to and but they never my name never seems to come up
what did you think of the process
how hung was it i mean what was the vote
uh-huh
i don't know i i've always thought that the fact that it has to be unanimous means that there wasn't any doubt in people's minds
and if it if in like in your case if there's two people who weren't convinced that the fellow was guilty
then or innocent i you didn't say which way it went
it can go either way if there's two people that aren't convinced one way or the other then that's
you know i don't i think one change that might be worthwhile would be to say that you need unanimous verdict to find somebody guilty
but if you don't get a unanimous guilty verdict then they're innocent
because the prosecution didn't prove their case to all twelve people
huh
huh
that's ridiculous
the judge does all sentencing for everything except capital cases here
i think it is appropriate i think that the judge
probably has a much better feel for what sentences other people who have committed comparable crimes have received and what the guidelines are and
i think that by the time you get to that point all the facts have been settled the person's been convicted and the punishment should be
well a fairly objective thing i don't know if there really needs to be all that much discretion in sentencing once you've determined what crime the person is guilty of
um-hum
yeah here in georgia when they have the jury involved in sentencing like in a capital case the prosecution is not allowed to say that if you if you give them life he'll be out in seven years that's against the rules
but in with the judge making all the other sentences
course the judge has open to him all of the previous criminal history
and obviously the judge knows what all the guidelines or what all the effects can be of parole and things like that
well i think the
the reform of the jury process that i would like most to see
is for juries to be required to be informed of their right to judge not only the facts of the case but also the law itself
juries and lot of people are not aware of this but it is
it's part of the common law and it really is in georgia it is part of the state constitution and it is in the constitution of a lot of states that if the jury
believes that the law that someone is being tried on is unjust the law itself is unjust the jury can refuse to convict the person
and this is sort of the people's last line of defense against
yeah he's a commentator isn't he
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah and it means a horrible time to have tax cuts at this point
i think you know as far at least as far as our deficit's concerned
you know and everyone and every all the candidates just seem to be you know have this bread and circuses policy of
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
it really wouldn't surprise me if that happens in the next twenty years
and we are still considered the best credit risk in the world
supposedly
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
we we've been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in things
i
well it in it
you know we our companies are have definitely become top heavy
in management
you know our
you know the trend of over consumption since world war two
you know when you know when you combine with the with the mismanagement that a lot of american companies have had
do you have children
do you how old is she
that you are going to let them make
right
uh-huh
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah where did you go to school
oh was that local or
uh-huh
yeah
but i mean so what's
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
so you did you commute everyday then or oh okay
oh okay when you said it was quite a quite a way away i did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour or
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
so did you go there like straight out of high school
see i did not get my degree until later on so i just finished mine a couple of years ago
and you know i guess
you know when you have to do it that way it makes your choices a lot easier but
uh-huh
right
right
exactly
yeah
which group do you work in ti
oh where is that at
i see
how long do you work for ti
did you work somewhere else like sounds like you got your masters before here or
i see
uh-huh after your masters or after your
i see
i see
uh-huh
i see
depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that so i have not really made up my mind you know whether to encourage them to go different places or
right
right
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah
because you went there
i didn't know that
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah your old school
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah so did you drum up any interest then or
well that's good
uh-huh
and that
uh-huh
oh really
uh-huh
yeah it sounds like it well you know i think richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely
well how do you feel about spot testing for drugs
um-hum
right
yeah it's refreshing to hear somebody that has a similar opinion as mine i mean all these people that are against it that may yeah they may not even be on drugs yet they call it an invasion of privacy
and i don't see you know that to me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for
and they i believe that they have the right to know if you're using a dangerous substance
but
um-hum
right
yeah no i agree that you know you there needs to be a well thought out sane approach to how to administer that program just because you know you something can get mixed up in the mail or
right
yeah
right and you know i've the company that i work for has just recently well you know within the last couple of years instituted for all new hired employees they submit to a urine test
and
they say that there've been you know they they've also implemented random testing
yeah
right
or the quality of their products
yeah
um-hum
right because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect
hum
yeah
yes i do
and i'm down in the central but i don't know how familiar you are with texas but i'm in a we live in a town near a town called temple which is right in between waco and austin on the freeway
right we're yeah we're probably about two and a half hours south of him
so
oh my it's actually we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday and it's cooled things down somewhat it's getting more humid now but
it's been about three weeks since we had any
hum
wow
how about that
well i hope you do get some rain up there
but
one of the things i found interesting it it's funny that you mentioned that ti is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants all around the world
including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal
and the policy doesn't apply to those folks
yeah i thought that was kind of interesting too
yeah i mean from a quality standpoint that's not i mean just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way
yeah
right
yeah but like if you're going to do business in another country you've got to respect their rules i mean if you know that's the trade off i guess
yeah
hum
right
that's right
yeah from the middle east
yeah iraq iran in that area yeah
well in saudi arabia you know using alcohol and drugs and stuff like that you get the death penalty
well people tend to take the first amendment out of context which means you know i could do anything i want to and you can't stop me and you know
yeah
so that's
i don't know i'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy
okay i think la law
and
dallas
i'm a veteran of all of dallas shows
it's very embarrassing
dallas
oh okay i just moved here last april
and i got i got married to a tier and
the first thing my mom and i did when we moved out here was go to southfork it was very embarrassing
they have a museum there of all the dallas
people and they even have a genealogy chart of all of the people who married who and whose children are whose and they even went so far as to put dotted lines on there as to who had an affair with who
yeah that wasn't a very good thing that happened to that family
they kind of went in there and took over
well that's what i'm doing may third i'm going to sit right here watch it
actually i haven't watched it much this season in the last couple of years i've been on that downward trend
yeah those tv movies or something
it was funny i spent a year overseas a few years ago and all the tv was i was in japan and all the tv shows were in japanese
yeah all those dubs it's terrible
well i
i can't remember the last time i saw it
i know that susan dey is with jimmy smits
yeah
and that just
she doesn't belong with him
no he's not with the firm anymore
yeah
really
wow
the
the tax attorney
yeah
really
he was a teacher
yeah
whoa
yeah
oh
uh-huh
at the firm
oh
no i guess i didn't see those
jeez
uh-huh
who
the worst person
i don't know
roxanne the secretary
well he's got a lot of business smarts though
i think what she did to him was a travesty
that's funny
boy they've really got their
yeah
well is
the tax attorney and his wife still married
oh
right
oh
that that's a weird marriage
they're married in real life
they've had i was surprised when they started having big problems and then i only caught part of the episode where he went on that nature deal
and -nd he got real into it i guess
oh she did
so you're a woodworker
what do you know about timber framing
what do you know about timber framing
right
uh-huh
yeah the reason i asked is because
we're embarking on a little adventure here
in that we're going to use some timber framing techniques to build a
a truss for a home
and it's a it's a you know what a mansard roof is
like a barn yeah
and they're mansard trusses that don't have any internal bracing
so the whole area is like a cathedral up there
for the second floor
right
um-hum
yeah that that's done some where they're actually create a single piece that is the trust
but what i want to do is i want to make four identical components
and cut the joints so that the
the more pressure you put on it the stronger it gets
and it involves interleaving and using you know locking wedges
yeah similar to that yeah
well if i do that and then cover it with two by six tongue and groove
it will be pretty sturdy because we have to we got what we call santa ana wind down here
it comes up out of mexico at about a hundred miles an hour
we're at a the at the northwest of denton texas
right on the red river
yeah well then you know about that wind
yeah
yeah we bought this land out here we're going to we're going to retire on it
maybe in twenty five thirty years from now but
you know we're still fairly young
well we're only going to have a porch on north and south end
and we'll have anderson window walls is what they are
so the whole wall just opens up it will be all glass
because on the piece of property we have it's the second highest pointed in the county
and we can see oklahoma to the north the lights of gainesville to the east and the lights of wichita falls to the west
and that's a and it's a we're just right on the southern rim of the red river valley
well you know where nocona is
nocona
okay that's about as far north as we can see just you know right on the other side of the river there
and boy it's really nice it's about an hour drive to work though
we don't have any traffic
yeah
well i used to live in springfield well actually chicopee falls
that's unbelievable
yeah it will be a lot of fun we're digging the foundation by hand
yeah the first floor's going to be underground
and it of course it will be open on the south and north end
and east and well see we have a little knoll on our property about thirty feet tall and it's almost straight up so we'll nestle the house right up next to it
right
cooling we don't have to worry about heat i mean
yeah but they're very short
it was tough today it was cold in the seventies
it went from thirty eight to ninety six on tuesday that's a pretty good temperature swing
well if you don't like the weather in texas just wait a minute
well you have a good day
all righty
not right now we
oh my gosh well you should have a lot to talk about then
but no the place i live in is a little too small right now for a pet i hate to hate to keep a dog or something like that and not have enough room for it to run around in so
but i guess you don't have that problem at least with the cat
um-hum
i can imagine
that's a pretty big dog
that's a pretty dog though
um-hum
how's he like the cat or how's the cat like the dog i guess it
uh-huh
i guess it's a good reason to have a pet then as protection i guess is one thing
um-hum
oh gee
um-hum
doesn't get too excited about anything
he's not one of those cats that like to sit on top of the television is he
um-hum
yeah i've noticed how they get black cats it seems like they always wanna sit on top of the television set and let their tail only when there's something you really want to see then they let their tail down in front of the tv set in front of the screen and
they just seem to know i guess
but
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
hm
neither did i
huh
oh gee that is a big rabbit
um-hum
but
was he
but he's not much protection i would imagine
not an attack rabbit or anything like that
not real protective but
all right well very nice speaking to you bye-bye
uh-huh
do you wear those lycra
fitness clothes
one of my house mates has some of those things
uh-huh she seems to like them because they stretch a lot and give a lot when she rows
um-hum rowing is a real popular fitness activity in philadelphia
not very much my main
focus right now is getting my dissertation finished and so my workouts tend to be limited to going swimming
to school i generally wear blue jeans and depending on the temperature a sweater and then a cotton polo shirt
it's been pretty cold lately it's snowing today
oh my goodness
oh now tell me about the tennis shoes for running and how what a difference that makes
um-hum
do you go running down the sidewalk or down the street
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
right
um-hum
right
right
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right now my housemate's boyfriend just got he's training for a marathon and he just got some
some nike air shoes and he says that you can also run a lot further in those because you save a lot of more energy
my shoes i just got some new ones my old ones had blown out and my new ones are reebok basketball shoes
i picked them out mainly because they were on a big sale
my shoes are blue so the
the blue shoes the green shoes and the red shoes were about fifteen dollars or a little bit more than fifteen dollars less than the white shoes
so i went ahead and got a blue pair of sneaks
so at my one of my old housemate's i just was watching her give a talk over at the business college yesterday she's looking for a permanent job right now but she
was talking about loss aversion which is when you hate to give something up
that you already have so
somebody like you that's used to having good quality sneaks would really hate to give up good quality sneaks for a better price
but somebody like me who's not used to having good quality sneaks would hate to pay more for better quality sneaks
family reunions
uh-huh
huh
which state park
huh
yeah
right
yes that sounds wonderful i we have family reunions not on a regular basis and there's mostly in my wife's family my family's very small
it's essentially the four of us makes up my family but
when we do get together and the two families do get together it's usually a wedding or a anniversary my wife's
grandparents are still living and on one side both are living and on the other side the grandmother is still living so we do occasional get together usually in new hampshire
at my mother-in-law's house and
at north hampton right
i'm sorry
so yeah and i don't know do you do anything special to make it interesting
oh right
yeah
oh yeah uh-huh
right
right
everybody has a specialty and so it's sort of it's a sort of a high class potluck i guess you could say and it's wonderful it's i mean
right i mean and if somebody didn't make
the usually thing they'd be you know everybody else would get all upset you know so if you try something new right and try something new it's not it's not acceptable
so and the kids are usually playing out in the back she's got ten acres of
property that go with her house so there's plenty of room for the kids to go crazy and the parents can
yeah oh that will be nice
yeah do you have a feel for how many people there are when you get together
well let's see i don't think i could put a number on it i know that we have three kids and my
wife has two other sisters and one of her sisters has
two kids and then her brother has two kids going on three so there's plenty of plenty of that and then her stepfather has
a daughter and a son and the son has two children so
no i they're pretty good at it my daughter i guess is the oldest she's ten
and she is really good at that you know that kind of thing getting everybody together to play games and stuff so they i mean they don't need much
provide a lot of things to a lot of toys and things yeah there's a lot of stuff just there to let your imagination go wild with you know of course the new thing is the nintendo
and all the kids seem to enjoy that we will have an nintendo somebody will bring an nintendo right i well my i know my sister-in-law who is engaged to be married
and oh then we always video tape
so we always have the gang on tape and we see how they grow each year yeah that's a lot of fun
that's a there will be times when we'll turn that on instead of instead of watching something on tv
no her family is in new hampshire and in new york and in oh in north carolina
uh-huh
new mexico wow that's we've seen just a little bit of new mexico we haven't really traveled that much since we've been here but we've seen a little bit of new mexico and that was very nice and colorado seemed very nice
oh yeah up in the mountains yeah that's what we miss we miss mountains and trees
of course you have plenty of plenty of mountains in virginia and then in and you know up in new hampshire and maine too we had one of the
times that we had sort of a family reunion was when was this i think it was last winter we went up to new hampshire to go skiing
and a bunch of us got together it wasn't the whole family it wasn't all the all the cousins usually when we make a trip
out there somebody else flies in or something because my wife's family all have well they have a lot of connections with the airlines my
i have a brother-in-law who is a pilot my father-in-law is a pilot and so
yeah a lot of mobile people so the so the sister-in-law who lives in north carolina can usually get up and
oh yeah
have you heard about these businesses these companies that i mean their business is planning family reunions for people oh yeah that's i thought about this and it seems like a pretty neat
thing they do family reunions and they do oh what do you call it
oh class reunions
and they make all the plans they contact everybody and they make sure everybody's got travel arrangements and
and i guess it's in fact i think it was started by somebody who was a travel agent and they got this brainstorm that you know they could make a living
by arranging for different family reunions and class reunions all over the country yeah i always thought that would be kind of might be kind of fun you know especially with a class reunion where you have to
arrange for the catering and they have name tags
than i would have a probably a year or so ago so i i've been getting a little more interested in court procedures too
well i guess it could be but i agree with you in that to the extent that i think
it largely would be more uniform i think as a opposed to a real mixture of juries with in different locations and different you know ideas
yeah
i think it was yeah houston i've been hearing about that yeah
yeah plus he was getting a lot of
criticisms i guess for by different groups you know about just being inhumane you know that sort of thing
yeah and the costs are real high i guess of both of keeping someone in prison and going through the trial procedure the whole works
and that just comes out of the tax money and in a lot of cases the
the person being tried sometimes you know they do have the means to repay the courts or the victims or the prisons to keep them
or to perform some sort of more work than is currently done in most prisons
the other question i guess that to be addressed is whether
a verdict should require unanimous
decision
yeah it
a majority that would vote guilty and to have just one dissenting vote could jeopardize the whole process or whole verdict to
and it seems like it should just be
some come up with some sort of majority maybe a two thirds or a three quarters majority or something because it's
it's hard to get every single person to agree on anything like you say
well it has to right now it has to be unanimous on most of those decisions if not it's a hung jury and they're asked to stay in and try to come up with the unanimous verdict and then if eventually it's
not unanimous even by one vote it's sometimes i think it's either thrown out or they have to go for retrial
even if just one person is holding out or can't be convinced to vote guilty
yeah i mean that's really a really a lot of cost to bring that to trial again
yeah it needs some revising and i heard that this is a little unrelated i guess but i heard
what was it the other day it said to for someone who's convicted and put on death row it was it was up in the millions what it costs
to keep that person and then to execute that person at the time you know it usually takes years to do that
yeah and that was just amazing that they were talking about a millions of dollars per
so what do you think do you know any people from puerto rico
oh really
uh-huh
yeah have you ever been there
have you ever been there
really
no i've never been there either i've not known but just a few people from there
one there was a girl in
in my flight in air force basic training actually who was from there
uh-huh
oh yeah
it always sounds more
oh its
i think i think everything always sounds more glamorous than it really is
because i spent five years in europe and everybody goes oh you're so lucky and i'm like well yeah sort of you know it's but having lived there it's not it's not anything like you picture it
you know it's not it's like i still have the fantasies about hawaii and all that stuff but
yeah
really i think
i'm not opposed to it but when its when the time is right it will probably just kind of happen you know
well where are we where are we going to get another state
oh yeah
oh yeah because it's just a territory or is that what it's called a territory
okay
is that a u s territory though
that would be kind of bizarre
that's kind of far
well that's true but there is not a whole lot between here and there
where you start dealing with guam it's like you know flying over all these other places to get there
my dad was stationed in guam during the world war two though
yeah
of course you could annex cuba but they wouldn't like that a bit
i don't think they'd go for that
um-hum
oh yeah do you think
no i have no idea but so you think that mostly they're pretty much satisfied with things the way they are
yeah
exactly
really that's why i said you know when it when their time is right when they're ready for it you know that it will come about
okay
well rick it's been good talking to you
i think so i think its they want like five minutes or something don't they
oh okay
okay bye-bye
well as a science teacher i been encouraging recycling for a long time and we collect things at school such as foil
and cans and glass to a certain extent i coach an om team and we save everything the kids at school bring some things in but not as much as i'd like and i have recyclings bins at home
and we've had a we save foil which i think a lot of people don't realize they could sell along with the i mean aluminum cans
well reynold's aluminum has this big balls of foil competition thing going and i don't know where we're supposed to turn it in another science teacher at school is in charge of that and
got all the materials on it but we're saving foil and accumulating balls of foil in our room
not yet it is in some communities but it isn't here and it is experimental in some areas at this point they're trying it out and deciding what they're gonna do with it
that's true
my husband gets irritated sometimes because of the even though i bought recycling bins
and we keep our cans in one thing and glass in another and paper in another it once it gets full getting it loaded into the car and taking it is a pain
yeah and sometimes you go to those recycling places and like with cans often times there's a long line
you know if it's one of those where you get change for your cans
now if it's just a donation type of thing like at the library or some places like that sometimes people'll just dump their stuff at right at the front they don't go to the back of the
like if it's a truck or whatever for paper
and then everything's just starts getting piled outside which is a pain because that's not what's supposed to be happening
i think so too i am in hopes that will be successful and that they will decide to go ahead and spread it to our neighborhood as well
um-hum
that's true
some of them are recyclable and i started trying to save those but we couldn't find a place to dump them
and so we just had to throw them away
well i think
i was talking to someone who lives really almost on the other side of town said she knew of one place where you could go and so once a month they made this trek with all their recyclables but they also have a pickup
and they would take everything but that is it used to be such a pain and it's so far away from us and that's the only one she knew of
so i guess what we've decided is that we're doing our part by recycling three and going out of our way but to have to go clear across town for plastic because
and there's a little booklet called fifty ways you can save the earth have you read that
yes well i read some of those to the kids from time to time
so that they get some of the ideas from that but they are a lot more into recycling than they used to be
the children uh-huh because i teach middle school
and it's surprising some of them aren't but that probably goes right into their families
but there are even groups of parents that are recycling coalition type deal where they're really making speeches to the pta and the dad's club and everything trying to get more parents involved
so it's
well i certainly can
appreciate the patience and the you know energy and money and time and effort it would require for someone to you know take care of their elderly parent or whatever in their home
i think that you know would definitely be preferable if the person is
you know able to do that i think sometimes people take on i know i have one friend who is taken on more than she can handle you know with her mom just needing constant supervision and for one person to be able to cope with that you know is really
difficult but i know it's hard to not to feel guilty you know to put somebody in a nursing home i if i suppose if you could find a nursing home that you thought really comfortable you know that they were getting adequate care but i think that's probably pretty hard to do at times
so there's a lot of factors involved
well i think i would you know in some ways have to decide how much personally you know i was able and willing to handle and how much it would affect you know the rest of my family because i have two small children
and we don't have a real large house if you had a lot of money and you were able to
you know have like a little separate wing or something where i wouldn't have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and go away and that kind of thing to accommodate an elderly person
i think you know just the medical aspects too would be a big question how much it would require you know in terms of nursing care at home and i know that there is often times insurance companies won't even pay
you know and if they took families for doing things if they were in a nursing home would cost you know a hundred times more so that's
that's a consideration too but i don't know it'd be it would be a really rough choice to make you know depending on the parent their personality and you know your own family and what's going on with
i'm home all day anyway right now with young kids but if i was working you know full time and had to give up a career that would be another you know problem too but
the only people i've seen is my husband's grandmother has been in a nursing home for several years i know that there's been a lot of questions from other family members as to whether she's getting enough attention and
whether they just kind of let her sit there and roll her over once in a while it it's really tragic to go in those places you know
i think i would
look for a place that definitely had the physical attributes and it wasn't a sterile kind of environment but had a comfortable feeling to it that respected
that you seem to see some respect for peoples privacy and
the attitude that the staff would have towards the patients and i was at visiting a friend in the hospital and there was a nurse screaming at an older man who was there was a head injury unit and he had apparently
wet his pants and they had a blanket draped over him and the blanket had either fallen to the floor or he had dropped it on the floor and the nurse was just screaming at him about how
obscene that was or something and i just thought gosh if i walked into a place and i saw a staff member just berating or humiliating a patient i would definitely that would be something i'd really want to be on the look out for
i would hope that they would have you know some you consistent staff i know they don't pay that much in a lot of those places and so there's probably a lot of turnover that'd be another thing that would be
you know something to be important because i think it's confusing particularly if people are in some state of you know mental confusion anyway to have constant new people on staff and having to develop new relationships and
oh i don't know what else other than that maybe some place that
had activities you know that they could participate in instead of just kind of like sitting there watching the wall or something you know talking to other people who had family members there you know see how responsive the staff was to
the things i brought up you know that i thought were important for my family member
it would really be hard because when we go to visit i'm sure that places have you know their best
foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's going on behind the scenes it really would be hard to know it's kind of similar in away to some of the things you look for in going to try and find day care for your kids
you know so i'm sure that if you have enough money you can find just super care but you know the cost of this probably just horrendous
yeah i think that would be great i had wished often with my husband's grandmother that she had been in a place like that because she had lived alone in an upper story of an apartment building away from even
friends not really close by her or a grocery store or anything and i thought she could have lived a lot longer if she had been
in a place where she didn't have to climb up and down the stairs haul groceries and then she would have people to check on her and didn't have to cook because she just got to a point where she wouldn't cook just for herself and then she fell down and nobody knew about it for hours and hours and hours and
so i think that would be great if you know if i had to choose a place for myself that's definitely why i think that kind of atmosphere would be wonderful even i recall where i was living in the college dormitory as a graduate student
i thought how neat you know that you can have a place where you can you know go down together and have dinner with other people because if your living alone the isolation and the depression and all those other factors should be taken into consideration too
so i thought you know they should have dorms for older people they had activities going on all the time and you know it was really a much more comfortable lifestyle i could imagine for an older person so yeah i think that would be great if they had places like that
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah they had their own privacy yeah
um-hum
right
yeah i don't know you know how many of those there are but you know i definitely think it's a great idea to have that kind of thing
instead of just being kind of taken away from all of that and told where you're going to be and what you're going to do in a nursing home
so
yeah
yeah
let's hope it's true
um-hum
right well as the insurance companies get more into this preventative health care i think that will help it just seems very slow that happening but yeah i definitely think that will help
yeah
okay well take care thank you bye-bye
let's see yeah it was forty eight i was in the air force
we did an we did an air show out at out at
bowling green no out at andrews yeah
so what's it been like up there
uh-huh
yeah like september was hot and drier october
really huh
we had you know all these we have all these somebody said you know you're either a stranger or a fool if you try to predict texas weather but
we had all these people saying it was gonna be the hottest summer ever you know and we had all this rain and it really not a bad summer at all really cool but all of a sudden in october
september october it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time
then the end of october it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down you know and flash floods everywhere and that kind of deal
and then end of november the first like the second week you know the first week actually we had we had a freeze
and the average you know the average first frost is like the fifteenth of november here but usually it's not until later it's really strange
yeah
is it is it is it flooding anywhere
it just kind of we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here which will be you know a little bit more typical autumn weather
yeah and
yeah there you know usually there's i have a farm a hundred miles east of here in east texas
and you know all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to maine you know it's that same trees pines and hard woods know hickories and oaks and stuff and
i was up there last weekend and there are trees that still have their leaves on and they're green but they're dead
really weird this year
yeah it's usually beautiful up there isn't it
oh gorgeous that's yeah i'd say you could drive along in maryland
and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the and the pines and what not and you could you know you could be driving along east texas and it looks just the same it's almost you know identical kind of country
beautiful yeah oh
pull little oak tree that was dead and
well
it there's some trees like the oaks like a white oak seem to be pretty hearty that nothing bothers them their leaves are still green
and some of the other oaks there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves what i notice mostly is the red maples
the leaves are just dead the dogwoods look still you know they got bit on the ends of leaf a little bit but they still look pretty good
it just depends on the on the on the tree
university of pennsylvania i'm a graduate student
and the benefits that i get are very minimal
but i do get my health insurance paid for but i don't have any kind of disability insurance or
let's see no disability insurance no well i in a way i get vacation pay because i get to totally set my own schedule
but
not any real significant benefits my health insurance is very minimal
uh-huh
you're undergraduate student or graduate student
undergrad yeah
yeah here they for the grad students at least
in physiology department which my degree granting department is engineering but physiology and the biomedical departments at least pay the health insurance engineering doesn't even do that
but i don't know i think that it would be great if instead of having health insurance and all those things tied to a job the way they are now
so that some people can get them and some people can't and it's like having two classes of income some that is taxed and some that is not it'd be great if they had
everybody responsible for their own health insurance
and either that or
they could be responsible for their own health insurance but if they did take the company benefit then that would be taxed like other income
so then that would everybody would know what their real income was and that their benefit that they were getting from the company was costing them something and that they might want to look around to get something better somewhere else
so
i guess
i would like to see something like that and then
i guess the going beyond just the idea of benefits having
instead of a national health insurance system having
a sort of like an fdic for health insurers so if you're health insurance company goes out of business you don't lose everything if you get sick
but on the other hand in the state of the current system i'll
whenever i get out of here i'll look for
a job probably an academic job that would
you know benefits i don't know how important that'll be usually academic jobs you get tiaa for your retirement plan
which is a it's a mutual fund that allows you to transfer your benefits with you with whatever job you go to
and
i know my daddy worked for the federal government
and he was in the soil conservation service and then after he retired from that he taught school for a while and he had taught school early in his career so he got the
federal retiree benefits and the state retiree benefits and the most important for him has been the health insurance because my mama isn't particularly well
she has she's a kidney patient on dialysis and he was saying that
now that her kidneys have totally failed they've taken her off one of the drugs lasix which is a diuretic it changes how the kidneys absorb moisture
so and that's the lowest it's been in quite some time and so health insurance can be a real big important thing to get
what kind of job are you thinking about getting when you get out
um-hum
uh-huh
what kind of company are you working with co-oping
i see
uh-huh
right
i don't know much about this topic let me ask you does she spell her name with two ns and an e
oh okay well then we're all right okay that would have been totally weird
i have no idea who listens to this
oh right i didn't know there was a proposal to serve young people to have a year of public service
yeah i didn't
i didn't either are you from pennsylvania
no i could smell an accent a mile away
are you in pennsylvania or dallas right now
oh okay
yes i'm in dallas my husband's a tier
are you my
oh how nice
i don't know i'd first of all is there a proposal in this i mean is there a legitimate proposal i didn't see that on the list but i guess it's unless yeah
yeah really i guess i would say that if there is one i would think that they are talking eighteen years or twenty one years of age
but i personally don't think it's a good idea for a year i would look at it more as a internship kind of thing maybe three months through you know ninety days to six months or something but more than that i would have a problem with it
enforcement
yeah the way the way the voice might have worded it sounded almost mandatory as opposed to elected and i would obviously i mean not obviously but i would be against anything like that being mandatory
right
there you go yeah
that and thus think i mean i don't know i went to even though i'm from that part of the country i did go to high school in the midwest and chicago and i we had it was mandatory that we took civics every year
yeah it was a mandatory and then you had to take a test that showed you had a certain knowledge of state government and state service and they did offer actually certain types of public service internships that i think is a very good idea that that's mandatory
but i don't know how any i mean the whole thing sounds a little bit ludicrous but that's my word
uh-huh
right
and when they're younger not when they're getting into undergraduate and college age
i don't yeah and i maybe that's not what they meant maybe that's just the way both of us took the wording but i
i think it's a good i get idea to get younger people involved in the government in some way or the public you know it's just they they're not aware of why things cost what they do why things operate the way they do but i just
you mean in the area of geographic region you're in uh-huh
grass roots effort
uh-huh
huh
oh my
uh-huh
oh yeah they do that i mean in north texas they do that quite a bit where you know if you want to go to this particular movie or concert or a discounted thing the big thing down here is rodeos if you
uh-huh
are they
are you are you in northern virginia or are you in the district of columbia
yeah
okay
yeah that's we're in a yeah that's we're in a near next to a town called plano texas and it's very it's like falls church i mean montgomery county i'm familiar with where you're at and they really that's a good way to put it i know
i went to high school in the city of chicago at an inner city school although i lived in a different area near a place called evanston illinois
and the reason that i stayed at the school i did was because at evanston township which back then was like one of the three larger schools in the country
everybody was already doing the driving the beamers and you know with nothing to think that they didn't have five hundred dollar wardrobes you know every week that kind of thing
i just i just think the one thing they do so strongly about is what your saying that i don't think kids have a sense of civic responsibility
i think then that's a step away from even duty i don't think they even have a sense of the responsibility
uh-huh
this is true yeah
yeah i think the one thing the there's a program called habitat for humanity that jimmy carter started the former president and i think i think programs like that with what you just talked about going on in your area local area at and something like that would be good
formed yeah they're already
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i agree with you like pre junior high and see and make it you know a curriculum oriented type of proposal as opposed to anything mandated like the old selective service or anything so it sounds like we're in agreement with that
yeah i do i mean i didn't grow up totally there because of a parent parental divorce in my family but you know it was always shuttle back and forth so it's like two homes but yeah i miss it
yeah
yeah really is they've cleaned it up a lot though i mean i don't think we'll get in trouble doing that
yeah i lived there in my early twenties too before i moved
that's weird i hope we never
well we're probably different from you folks down here we're into mexican or tex-mex or something like that tends to be one of my favorites is to go out to have some mexican food we have like
el chico's and one new place that's pretty good is pappasito's so when i go out and i like to splurge on eating i usually like to go out and get some mexican food and make sure there's a basket of chips keeps being replenished on the table
no i'm not a native here actually
from philadelphia originally and lived in ohio for you know a good portion of time going to high school and college there so i've been down here for about eight years but
i don't know that's just something that i really picked up on i really did like the mexican food the other thing i like i guess i don't eat it as often is maybe italian food we don't have as many places around here to eat italian food but
i like italian food
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's not too close to the real thing
oh yeah
uh-huh
where did you go for it
did you go like to hoffbrau steaks
park suite yeah right across the street yeah
uh-huh
and what was the name of it
okay
right
yeah
yeah
no i can maybe eat some jalapenos but i really don't you know ask for those on there i'm more like into the enchiladas and stuff like that but no i don't really like it hot
i remember meeting somebody a long time ago before i ever moved to texas and he put hot sauce on everything he ate i mean tabasco's and that kind of stuff on everything he ate i think he must've just had a stomach that was iron or something
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well those are my two favorites
you know
yeah there's one favorite place that we have called august moon that's pretty good and i've got one thing on the menu that i really love but we don't
do that probably as often we used to do a quick take out kind of place that wasn't real great chinese but we used to do we just liked vegetable fried rice quite a bit
just you know as a quick kind of dinner thing that's you know it's not real filling but you know get some veggies and rice and stuff every once in a while we go out to a little bit nicer chinese place
yeah
uh-huh
well recently we've both been trying to do some diet so we haven't gone out because when they tell you about how much fat is in all that food you know it really kind of crimps your style there but
we probably you know maybe go out like once a week on the weekend usually with friends or something we kind of go out not always you know sometimes we cook the meal at home and have people in
but i haven't really thought about you know the economy all that much and eating out we never really did it a lot but
you know we do maybe go out a couple of times a month at least to eat out
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well though you know ti has laid off quite a few in this area and then general dynamics has its woes too so that it seems like there's been
a lot of people recently you know when big companies change their programs and such that
there's been an influx of some unemployed but probably when you spread it out over everybody in dallas it maybe has not changed the percentage all that much
you know maybe one or two percent possibly it's hard to say
it just seems like a lot when you hear about companies that keep continually advertising or stating that they're you know you know cutting out so many thousands of employees it sounds like big numbers of people out there
that's true
i think the people down here must shop for entertainment because we have more shopping malls within close proximity i mean it's like we could have shopping malls even across the road from each other
there must be a lot of people with a lot of money who just like to go out and shop because we have plentitude of shopping malls within like a five mile radius i
well i guess i'm a big laker la laker fan when it comes to pros
the college ranks
i guess i really of course i try to follow my alma mater that's byu
in utah but they don't have much of a team usually
yeah they you see them in football on tv once in awhile but you but you never see them on a
on nationally basketball
they last year they
had a really good team was the year that danny aines was there
that's about five six years ago by now
sweet sixteen once or twice in their history and that's
how about you
uh-huh
isn't the bulls you're talking about yeah the pro
is that right
uh-huh
no
so did you watch the final four this year
every game
right
yeah that i watched that game
and it was a good game it was a very close game and hard fought game
and it just i don't know it looked like unlv may have had more talent but as far as playing together as a team that day it didn't duke seemed to have them off balance
and that
right fast breaks and things and
they shut all that down and made them pay half court it seemed and
and
what
right
right they didn't have they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year and that and that
and so that's the you know it's a terrible time to have to deal with one right in it when it counts so much
right
i think i think that probably was the difference in that game because it really could have gone either way down to the end you know
well
probably not
since kareem's retired
they haven't had a center
and they've got perkins
but i don't think he's really been a super star for them
and
yes it's
right
so
i they'll make it you know i it's going to be a war between chicago and
boston celtics
that's going to be a war it's going to be a great series
uh-huh
one of those two will probably be in there
let me see where does detroit fit in
uh-huh
so
i don't know those three detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year
uh-huh
yeah they have the they have the play-off experience well so does detroit i mean so does chicago
so do they all three of them do with larry bird back you can never count the celtics out when larry bird's
starting to click on all cylinders they say he's starting to do starting to play
right
right
right
last i've heard is that he's starting to peak right now
and he's starting to be more consistent you know right at the right time of the year
oh any dark horses i you know
san antonio san antonio the dark horse that could
really flip in there i think somewhere
yeah
robinson's getting up there where
every game he's just i mean it looks like he's going in for a dunk and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back you know nobody's
got enough beef i guess to challenge him when he's when he's driving hard to the hoop
he's he
yeah for awhile anyways
i heard he was suspended
because of his
if they did they'd still have to pay his contract
they may have done it
it was a lot of money he was making like i heard on the radio it was sixty three thousand and change a month
that's what he was being paid
you know he wasn't even playing
oh boy what a good job he had
he ruined his sweet position
yeah i'm looking forward to the pro play-off
la yeah san antonio
who's the other one that's doing so well this year is that portland i haven't seen them on much tv at much at all but all i you do is hear about boy they have the scene the you know what do they have walter davis and
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah i don't i don't think there's any clear pick that you know
i guess i guess the two teams that i just you know think you can't count out are the are the celtics and the because of bird and
lakers because of magic johnson they they're two guys that seem to find a way when there's when there's when it's on the line they seem to find a way
you know so
those are what makes a champion i guess
yeah
well
nice talking to you take care bye
okay
i follow i've been a long time cincinnati reds fan because when i was growing up and i was five years old i wanted to be a catcher
so i was a big johnny bench fan so i've been through the with the reds since you know nineteen seventy
and i remember the seventy world series like i said i was only five years old then but i had to give a report to my dad every because that was when they played world series games in the afternoons sometimes
and
i've kind of gotten away from them until the last couple of years because i didn't really know many players and their team but i also being from the indiana area i like the cubs and the white sox
so i kind of follow those two teams
a little bit and you know since moving down here the rangers you know i've been picking up on them a little bit
and
it looks like they could do all right this year and of course they're in there with the white sox i believe and they're in their division so
the white sox headed for probably another good year i hope what about yourself
yeah
yeah
yeah do you go to a lot of games
uh-huh
that's i've been looking forward to it i've only been to one game
and i just moved down here at the end of last summer so that last season was winding down so i'm hopefully i'll get to a couple this year i want to see nolan pitch one time
that that's be that'd be really neat
yeah
it might
did they play today
uh-huh
yeah that's right that's right
yeah i watched a little bit of the i was flipping back and forth between the pacers and the celtics and the white sox game
that was on today and
i just like i like the white sox i've never really got into them and then this friend of mine was just a hard core white sox so he took me to a game and you know i think they're you know they're really neat because they're such a young team
actually the youngest team in baseball and they got some
you know the last three or four years their number one picks you know they're all suited up and playing for them
and the draft and
you got to like that you know and building the team through draft picks and stuff like that
yeah it does hopefully some of their players will come through and they got tim raines and a veteran and they got carlton fisk he's you know still pretty solid a lot of experience
but
you like the astros or anything like that
uh-huh
yeah
well when was the last time the rangers really did well
yeah
so they were contenders till about three or fours years ago
yeah i don't i never really followed them all i knew
kind of watched them a little bit in the seventies there again you know cause i was a little catcher in baseball i liked to watch a jim sundberg and like a jeff burroughs
forget who else used to play for them but yeah those guys were really tough
yeah
you think he's pretty good
yeah
i was watching the game yesterday and they had bases loaded
and they tried a squeeze play
and i just couldn't understand that i forget whose who was batting and but
i couldn't understand that move there was only one out
and it's like you know give the guy a cut you know you got bases loaded you know one mistake cause a lot of these players aren't used to bunting that much and it's a easy double play
but
you didn't like that move
yeah
yeah
it's true
what about
sierra you a big ruben sierra fan
he's been around what four or five years
you think you can see him staying there for awhile or
yeah
oh yeah i'd i turned the game on i don't know who won
well good
yeah i'm kind of into baseball cards so
last year i was buying a lot of juan gonzalez cards
so i'm hoping he's going to blossom and make me a rich man someday
yeah
yeah
well i'm definitely looking forward to going to a few games this summer that's good entertainment at a budget price
yeah
no you mean like
no
i mean
thing about rose i mean you know that he's got a problem in his personal life i just
you know he messed up but i still think he's belongs in the hall of fame and
and you know he played for so many so well for so many years that
yeah it's just too bad it's you know like the players that do drugs or do you know are alcoholics they just have a problem
and
and it's too bad it carried over and has hurt his image and everything else
yeah
yeah i think lou pinella is doing a good job too obviously
he knows you know he's
you know he's been there he's played a lot of ball himself
so he's been in some world series and you know he's
a lot of experience as a player and it looks like he's doing all right as a manager
and so
well
thanks for this is the first time i've ever been called so it's kind of interesting yeah i usually get home and pick up the phone and do some calling so
but i appreciate your calling
all right take care
bye
no i'm at texas instruments um-hum
oh golly numerous application presentations memos spreadsheets
just all kinds of things
i don't do any plotting though i don't do any you know i don't do any device creations or anything like that
like in autocad i don't do those but we have that capability here
uh-huh
um-hum that's been ongoing for quite a while now is the speech recognition it's i don't know how old it is but i know they've been pursuing it for a long time
that's right yes a lot of glitches to get out of it to work out of it uh-huh
oh that's interesting isn't it
oh my word
um-hum
well that's wonderful how are you advancing on your endeavors
well great that sounds good
um-hum
yeah
well that's wonderful that's wonderful now if we can get everybody together that has got all these new inputs that they're doing for speech
and if they could get them together and compare notes they probably would do well to jump a couple hundred feet in that area
um-hum
well that's good do you have
do you have a group that you can interface with each other like
who's interested in speech
that wouldn't be a bad idea though do you think that
uh-huh
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
so it's that soon
um-hum
it's going to be interesting to
look at
i'm not involved in it myself you know but just hearing what is going on at ti is very fascinating
and i don't know that much about it i know that in the group that i was working in there was
an area that was really focused on speech recognition however i'm not in that organization any more within ti i'm in a different area of ti now working on something totally different
so my interest was spurred and then it was taken away because i was moved out of that area
oh it's definitely very fascinating
uh-huh
um-hum
oh that's wonderful
that's like almost giving them a evaluation
and going into the direction where they're gifted in
that's wonderful
um-hum
um-hum
well you're you sound like you're very current with all that information
i know it because you have children too and you're also interested in the
and let the let the parents worry about the about their babies
but you just know that their doing well so but i don't have any idea what's going on in the schools today
i'm not active in any school other than paying my school taxes
i've only i've got about four maybe
i try to limit them because i well one i don't use them
too much and i use my visa just for about everything and i pay it all off
so i try not to i just use it for free money for thirty days basically
i'm you know i'm in the age group you get out of college and i think a lot of these people have them maxed out
i don't think i ever tried
well
yeah i you know it's
you know feasible i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but
just depends
yeah so basically if you want to take the risk
do you trust your son
uh-huh
uh-huh i'd say do you know
have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something
yeah
uh-huh
the extended loan payment for your car
yeah i saw that
well it's business and they're making money off that
yeah and it's so it's business so and you notice that they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old
and so they've already shifted the risk if they assume that car then they just have to sell it themselves and they'll recover the loan
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
what now what's ten percent we can deduct
i didn't know that
i didn't think you could anything on a loan or
i mean a mortgage i know you can
oh i've never itemized yet
so maybe that's
schedule a or
yeah
yeah i try i really do i just try to stay out of debt and i and i use my visa for as much as i can and i pay it all off and
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i'll never do that again i still got a couple of years on it to go and i'm
uh-huh
well you think you're starting out well until you start paying all those bills apartment rent and
yeah well
yeah and
yeah so
yeah they're convenient you know that's a
probably one big thing about them and
uh-huh
yeah well i was used to using my credit card like at skaggs alpha beta in dallas and stuff and now i'm out here in phoenix
they none of these grocery stores take any credit cards so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me you know i got to have sixty bucks on me or something
so
that was interesting cause i always you know you didn't have to worry about carrying that much unless i knew i
yeah i've heard about them
that's mostly locally the banks will line up with
yeah
all righty
all righty
take it easy
no i've only been here a couple of years but i've noticed that this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past
yeah well i remember last year or the year before we had ice and snow we had a had a terrible ice storm around this time of the year
and this year it's been so hot and sunny it it's really quite amazing
hm
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh i haven't you know i think it's really been delightful i come i've spent most of my time in warm weather areas and the ice and snow just doesn't hold any allure for me at all
uh-huh
do you think san antonio's more comfortable than dallas
um-hum
you must well -t it must be quite a bit hotter down there isn't it
oh wow
oh yes
oh yeah it's terrible
yeah
hm wow
hm i know i tend to
i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate it doesn't some people say they like to watch the changing of the seasons but
i i'd rather you know like southern california you know have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time
so it's kind of a luxury
well i guess this the weather isn't as lively a topic as some of the others we might have gotten
it's about thirty five hundred square feet
it is have you been living there very long
so you've been there longer we built this one about it's been
let's see
it's been six years six and a half years ago and we subcontracted it on ourselves we bought the lot and
had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications and then we subbed it out so
we've been here a little over six years now and have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in
my husband got his big garage he we have a three car garage but he has a big work area in it and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and
so he has all the work space he needs
he
it is and that's why we decided to build we looked at things that were already built and the garages were always
if the house were was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have
um-hum
so we put a three car garage in but even if they had three car garages they didn't have a work space all of it was taken up with just car space
and so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on
well sounds like our husbands have similar interests
oh i see
uh-huh well that's nice that it's not in your house
um-hum
um-hum
right
well we still have a son and daughter in college that come home and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come
his parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom
right
um-hum
oh i understand well
well i okay i haven't reached that point yet i've heard people say that but
my middle son is engaged my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while he's out of college and has a good job so he could afford to get married but
is not engaged yet and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while but she's still in college and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first
that's what she plans to do so i hope so
oh ho
a whole new world um-hum
i can understand
um-hum
so you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute
yeah
well that's the same thing that i did and i hope i'll be able to do the same with grandchildren
well we have
i did attend public school for all but one year i
went to a catholic school for one year found that it did not agree with me or i did not agree with it and spent the rest of my education in public schools
i had mixed feelings on it because i thought that there was a greater range of students that a public school has to
has to address
right and the programs have to be wider when i went to the catholic high school there was nothing but a college preparatory course
and in the public school there were a couple of different courses the
right
that
the college prep course was any worse in a public school than it would've been in a private school
but i think that the teachers were spread a little more thin because they weren't always able to focus on the areas that they taught best
well a little bit of both the school wasn't very crowded when i went there although it's since gotten it's since gotten worse but there were
there were some very good math teachers there was one
a science teacher in particular there who ended up having to teach a i can't remember what course it was but it was really unsuitable it was some sort of
shop or mechanical drawing class and he just
he didn't know much about it but they figured he was a warm body in a room
right
and i don't think that
i don't think that there are the resources in most public schools to be able to say well what we need here is a
trained machinist to teach the metal shop course let's go find one they just say well you know we have this course we need a body for it
right
did you go to a public school
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
sure
right
um-hum so have you started looking into alternative schools like montessories
uh-huh
um-hum
right
i can see a lot of advantages to homeschooling but
it's interesting there's someone here in rhode island who is very disgusted with the school system
earn vacation and of course the work place is very
it's a very nice area to work in
how about you
you don't
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
depends on your status
but really can't complain course the cost of living keeps going up salaries remain about the same and your medical benefits go up also
it surely does especially if you have a family
i don't but i know when you have children
it can get to be quite expensive
um-hum
is that right
gee i didn't realize that
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
um-hum
that's true
um-hum
i know that my parents recently retired well not recently maybe the last six eight years
and they had to buy a policy until
something kicked in at a certain age and they were paying an enormous amount of money per month
in order to maintain it really is
um-hum
um-hum
right
i know some of the companies when you do retire you're able to carry forward your insurance benefits
wouldn't that be wonderful
but i don't know i don't know what else would there be besides your insurance and your holiday paid and
oh uh-huh
oh yeah we have that
now that's true now we've started the ea where you can if you have like a mental health problem
a drug problem or what have you
mentally they will provide services for that now too and that's wonderful
oh yes uh-huh
um-hum
is that right well
hum is it like cigna or
kaiser
well we have that option at work to choose that or to stay with our company
that ti has desired to administer the insurance program
but you can either go with the hmo or stay with aetna
that's what i'm staying with
um-hum
um-hum
well i don't know about the hmo but through aetna it is not covered no
oh that's interesting
there was a crime here in mckinney a rather heinous murder there was no remorse shown by
at least one of the perpetrators and yet for whatever reason his crime was not considered a capital crime
an and quite honestly i feel very strongly that the man the has no redeeming social values and if and when he comes gets free again
he will have no compunction but to complete that same kind of
lifestyle i mean continue that same kind of lifestyle and perhaps do the same thing again so it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever
that's right
but yeah
did you
uh-huh
yes but my concern is first of all that not all persons who i think should be receiving capital
whatever capital
hum punishment thank you i'm sorry i just got home from work and i'm just kind of spaced out a little bit that not all of them are being
convicted of it that the they're not even being charged with that i agree with you that a person's heart can be changed
but the same god that can work that miracle also established the laws that said for certain kinds of sin certain kinds of
sins certain kinds of breaking of the law there would be a capital
punishment right then it was it was
almost immediate as soon as the trial was over then it was stoning we don't have a speedy trial we don't have speedy punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years
and so forth
that's correct
uh-huh
i tend to agree on that very strongly
plus the all the judicial system is overloaded with all kinds of problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the civil things that clog the courts
because we're suit happy but back to the to the capital situation sounds like you and i have a lot of common ground at least as far as
capital punishment is concerned i would like to see some kind of reform or some kind of streamlining so that if a person is convicted
and sentenced to death that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with
and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family or any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years
an him could be a her
but you see
that's sad
yeah
however certain very liberal minded groups who do not subscribe to the same ethical system that you and i do such as the civil liberties unions and so forth
will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath which is most unfortunate because we all lose out when people go so far out to the extreme on either side
because too often they're can be extremism that hurts from any direction regardless of whatever you're arguing or concerned about and
we all lose out
yeah
well see i don't have a relative that's made it over sixty one
uh-huh
but my children's on their father's side have them up into the nineties
but
the only time we came close and we started looking into it was when my grandmother became senile she start senile at fifty
and at that time the homes that we were looking for when i was a kid my mother i can remember them arguing they couldn't find one that it was either clean enough or they took enough care or
there was one thing or another that continuously arguing about it
and they ended up keeping her from relative to relative and of course she died when she was fifty nine so it wasn't that long
the few i've been in they have varied tremendous
so
oh well we were talking about it the other day because a girl at work has got that problem right now
and she keeps saying she's never going to put her mother in one and i says hey look go around look at them they're totally different than your concept of what it was years ago
and i says i don't know what condition your mother's in which i didn't
i says think about what she would like to have because a lot of them hey they might be bedridden but at least they've got company and people their own age to talk to
to keep them home what do you've got
they're sitting there like they're they vegetate
is what happens
uh-huh
see you're not aware of the horror stories and things like that i've grown up with
and i mean i'm talking about horror stories and they're still out there i mean it's not something that's been eliminated
there are lots of homes out there that just literally people drop them off forget about them and they change hands i mean i'm not saying they don't investigate they investigate it's great when they're there but unless they keep current with it
and they changes hands it goes either direction
because
they're relying on a lot of people that hey they're like any other business if you lose a lot of your customers they get into a financial bind
and people say well you know they're a nursing home but the hey it doesn't work that way they're a business
well like my neighbor she runs down here to this nursing home down here
and she just point blank's tired the pressure and responsibility of working as a nurse in a hospital
she admits it she's tired of it so she works down here she's a nurse she's qualified
but she's fifty oh she's in her early fifties somewhere and working down here at the nursing home keeps her hand in there she gets good money for it and she enjoys the old people
you know it's just that simple for her
but she says it's hard they get cranky they get obstinate
but she feels the same way i do i would rather depending on the situation i would rather be able to put myself or anybody else in a nursing home if i was able to get close enough to them
so they don't feel lost
now see my grandmother she wouldn't go in a nursing home besides being scared and everybody else didn't want her she was terrified of one literally and positively terrified
because she remembers the old stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh she drives yeah
oh yeah they've got nothing or they get on the telephone all day long
but i mean this is one area where i'd like to see social security or the government step in and take people over a certain age or with handicaps or something and take their social security away from them
i mean give them you know money at a certain point and putting them in homes to where they can get something fed back to them in other words people talk to and become still human beings
because you see people down in south dallas and every where else sitting in a house they don't know anybody they're scared to death of robbers they're scared to death of everything
they hardly have enough food to even eat on
i meant they're not living
yeah i mean hey i'm putting all this money out to the government why can't they put it out there rather than in the federal prisons
but you know you see pictures on tv i mean i wish i had enough money to go down there and do something but
you know i don't know they if they can have day care why can't they put elderly people care and put them in a home to where it's regulated
i mean it's a shame that we have this to where it's we don't think of our older people we really don't
all right
well what kind of car would i wanna buy i don't know
the question is i mean would i want to buy or would i would i probably actually buy may be two different things
if i had all the money i wanted then that's whole different matter yeah
no the car in that case i'd i don't know
i my dream car for years was a was a porsche turbo carrera
but i don't know if i'd want one of those now well i of course i would want one if somebody was giving it to me but i maybe would buy a bmw
or even a volvo
it's actually the first car we ever bought new and everything
uh-huh what
uh-huh we almost bought one of those do you like it
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
to what avis really
huh i guess
i see
uh-huh
right
you work for a big company then
ti i
i don't know i would probably if i were to buy a car you know and with the constraints of the of the of real money i probably would
and it really saved us some big money once
yeah they had a whole bunch of things that sort of broke at the same time
and the bill would've been over fifteen hundred dollars and i had to pay twenty five for the
yeah
well we bought the extended the extension
and at the time we bought it was like you know it was i don't know four hundred and twenty five dollars or something extra
yeah we did but you know we really debated at the beginning and of course i'm glad i did it
but we still have we still have like you know three years left on it
yeah
oh no
bumper
oh
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
right
yeah my sister drives one she drives a i don't know is it legend it's
and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth you know from four miles to work and back kind of thing
and so i bought a used yugo just to be a little you know a little car that i could care less about just waste yeah
oh well it's worked you know it i mean it's exactly what it is you know it's just a it's a cheap little you know little car just to go you know running run around town in and
it's actually kind of fun to drive i you know getting back in the daytona now i almost don't like it you know it's just like too mushy and it you know it's an automatic and the
it's too it's the steering is just you know you feel like you're in a boat or something you know it's kind of
oh
yes
that is that one that you were talking about
uh-huh
um-hum
that's true or the ones that are generated by a computer it's just a computer voice that comes on the line those are the ones that i really hate too
uh-huh yeah sometimes i get them on my answering machine at home so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them aren't from anybody at all
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand
so yeah i do i really feel that that's an invasion of my privacy
i agree with you on that particular subject there
let me see
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations
but they still come up to the front door and you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or they're from a religious organization
and i've read a lot about that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
um-hum
right
yeah no i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and i don't like the way that they do it either
and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
and i don't know i just i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations
and wanting to you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own
but you know i don't think that would stop people i mean it's like they see that word and it says go
oh goodness
oh gosh
yeah
yeah that's true that's true
hm well what else
i know but i remember you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think
you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else
and i can't remember what it was
and i thought yeah that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got we got to talking about the people coming to you at the front door
pretty
well it was nice talking to you too jim
okay thanks bye
hello larry
huh
okay well i you know i think that i think it's fine to do that but i don't think it should be mandatory i'm not
i'm not for having the equivalent of a draft
that's right it's
oh is that right
um-hum
um-hum
well i'd say as far as government jobs they could have some incentive for instance veterans get a preference when they're applying for a government job and i'd say people at
had voluntarily served in such a thing as the peace corps or something
could also get that
i don't know either
huh-uh
right
i feel the same way
i think that i have nothing against the draft when you know when the nation needs it
but obviously when you don't need it you don't have a draft and i feel the same thing with universal service if there was a need for it
then i'd say possibly i mean but it would to be an emergency type thing and i and i don't see that ever happening
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
um-hum
that's true
right
right
um-hum
um-hum
right
i think about on public service too i think it has some
some thought has to be given to what do we want these people to do in public service and that would have a bearing on what training should they have because if you wanted to have people you know as an incentive you can have people go in after high school
and then offer them assistance with their college and that way you'd be getting people who really didn't have any expertise in any particular but any particular field but they'd be willing hands so to speak on public service projects
um-hum
right
um-hum
are you familiar with the civilian conservation corps back in the thirties
okay well i mean it's before my time too but i read about it but you know in the height of the depression the government employed people to go work on public service projects
that's right like wpa it was the same thing and there were many a lot of the national parks were built up by the civilian conservation corps and a lot of wpa projects are still
serving the nation
so you know unskilled people could do things like that as long as they had a positive attitude
um-hum
i don't think we have one
or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support
without regard whether there is a democracy or a anarchy or anything else
well oh yeah and then of course there was there was the in columbia with the drug lords but we just
talked a lot we didn't actually do anything
i'm actually surprised at anything in central america along with panama
i'm just kind of surprised we did that
especially after our friend jimmy carter gave it away anyway
but i guess they had to finally do something actually bush has been better at that than i thought
i always considered him kind of a wimp
yeah reagan is kind of mush mouth
but i guess most of the policy that we're using now is a combination of reagan and carter
yeah we have so far but we really haven't of course we really haven't taken on the drug lords yet
i'd be interested to see if we do that
well we did in panama we did in
saudi arabia
it could be an interesting
interesting problem
i don't know if they could do it or not did you read tom clancy's a clear and present danger
i think you need to pick that up and read it it's quite it's quite interesting it addresses the problem
um-hum
actually he wrote that prior to the
medellin cartel being exposed
it was on the stands prior to that time it it's quite timely
and either he knows somebody or he has a real good real good imagination because its it hits pretty close to home
but i don't think we're going to have much of a choice in either central or south america
there's too many liberals in control they can't agree on anything
and they have blinders on as far as the policy goes
as long as somebody's getting killed as long as nobody knows about it it's okay but the minute it hit hits the paper then of course the kennedys and the and the udalls and
the dawes from georgia all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is
but i guess it i guess it's automatic respective
yeah you know the people have a right to know except about what it about what concerns them
and these are the people that make the foreign policy and it it's probably basically
i would not be surprised if the kennedy foundation or some of those don't have a lot of financial holdings in central and south america
considering the kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway
every time you drink scotch you're paying kennedys
good don't ever drink scotch it's terrible
i quit drinking scotch when i found out about that
but anyway but as far as far as you know central and south america we our policy pretty much
it depends on who we're what government we're buying down there at the particular time
yeah
although we do need to do something about you know of course in nicaragua and around there with the sandinistas and the contras that's been going on for years but then hell it's probably still be going on long after we're dead it'll still be the same thing
those people down there don't really
well i think basically they can't figure out what they want down there
it's all tradition it's all traditional they have to
you have the ruling class and you have everybody else
alrighty
talk to you later tom clancy it's called a clear and present danger
um-hum
he he's the one who wrote red october a hunt for red october
and i think if you read that i think you'll get a real kick out of it
all right bye-bye
uh-huh
hm
um-hum
yeah
well that i know the things that we kind of looked at is you wanna see how many teachers you have
and how many kids they have and how they break it up
it was a really good one and in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered my wife did artwork for them and then you know so we got our
day care free
but they didn't have enough teachers
and
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
hm
yeah
did they separate them by age group
because i'd think you know i think that's one thing that was important
uh-huh
it sound yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have
doctorates and phd's and all that kind of thing and you know all the technical stuff
but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good
yeah
yeah
the other the other group that we had was kind of interesting the other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team and we knew them from other associations but
it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and i think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know but he was actually the more
the more what demonstrative type the more loving he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids and
and it was kind of interesting to see that it was actually the man in the group that
that did that side of it
yeah so they had a really nice balance we liked that one in fact it was called humpty dumpty play school or something but they also did
they also did some of the teaching things and then they had
you know obedience was important
and you know so they you know they used
oh i think they used the you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
and it's one i can't remember what they call it exactly but you just stand them in front of the clock and you know it has a second hand that goes around
and they have to stand there
yeah i probably would put myself on a five or six scale being up here in the northeast
in the past of committing crimes or something in that order i think that it's important that there be some check
background checks before they just hand a gun over to any old person
yeah absolutely you know that's the one concern that i have too is that
and you know i come from up here i'm not in new york city area by any means so i'm in a rochester's not heavy crime area
but you know and i and it's been a political issue up here a big deal about whether or not
they should people should have access to handguns and some of these saturday night specials and plastic handguns and
yeah
yeah
yeah up here you know we have a lot of hunters up here if you go just to the south of rochester here you have a bunch of state parks and there's a lot of hunting that goes on and
that i think is by far the majority of people that own guns around here
tend to either be hunters or they live in the inner city and they're concerned about their safety
we've had up here the nra's main focus up here has been on protecting the hunting
the people who are doing a lot of hunting because being not a large urban area like new york city where you have an nra movement that's more attuned to personal protection
versus hunting that's pretty much how they've gone about it up here and some of the tactics i mean i noticed they changed their commercials
well it's a powerful lobby i mean i've debated issues on some other issues regarding the cable tv and that and the nra lobby is the most powerful that's up there in capitol hill and they do a number
well i work with computers just like your son
and i actually do research in speech recognition
and so as part of the reason i'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes but
i was working well actually i haven't worked for any large companies per se
recently but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations but
um-hum
one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because health care is so ridiculously expensive because we're paying our own insurance right now
and so one thing that i'm very concerned with now is
first of all health benefits because it's more important with a family and you know our doctor's routine doctor's visits covered my health insurance only covers
right yeah but i don't
right well my our deductible is five hundred but it's for each
event yeah
right but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick it doesn't cover
oh yeah it certainly is
um-hum
wow
um-hum
and probably the care -cal care is less expensive too
um-hum
so i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there and so the insurance would cost lower
well i know that friends of mine had a baby up in boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in manhattan
and they were at one of the better hospitals and you know good doctors in boston
and i was at one of the big hospitals in new york but that's a huge difference just between
you know and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable
so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that i'm really concerned about and most companies don't have some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have
you know someone that could watch my daughter at work and i'd go to work and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever it is
and i
it would be more convenient more productive
i think
uh-huh
and your and your hours are much more constrained and things like that
and that to me well that you know the those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with
yeah
right because you're you know certainly something like day care at the work place would like make life so much simpler that it's worth paying you know having a lower salary i would certainly accept a lower salary for that
yep
right and you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened
and you're less preoccupied with it i think
so but unfortunately there aren't i think ibm has started having that in certain locations
uh-huh is that locally
uh-huh
yeah because pittsburgh's a big enough city too but you know i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones
just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and
things like that because many times small companies offer
better benefits
in terms of quality of life than larger companies
like one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby any where between ten and forty hours a week
and you know call my own days call my own hours and
yeah and
you know which many times at a large company it's almost impossible
to do things like that
right and if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day
and so it all depends on what your position is there too
um-hum
uh-huh
was that when you were well you know those have its pluses and minuses too i've been a consultant recently and so i don't have any benefits at all and
right and the same thing my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is and they
right and they refuse to give him more salary
because they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and you know times are rough now so it's new it's harder to get
the
your increases and things but
yeah well the
and they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits he doesn't get well we don't care about retirement benefits he doesn't get vacation benefits and he does a lot of things that
get factored into somebody else's salary so really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know it's a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff
so
right
right here in philadelphia the
and then they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so every year a different piece of the city gets added to the list
but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now
you on the first and third saturdays of every month you take your
bottles and your newspapers and lets see bottles newspapers to certain corners in the neighborhood
and there is a farmer's market that collects the plastic they
it use to be a firehouse
but they're trying to get some urban renewal going in here and trying to make the area safer i live near the university of pennsylvania where i'm a grad student
and it's not the safest neighborhood there is
so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this farmer's market does is collect plastic
and they use that money to keep up the building and organize events and that kind of thing
right they have that for the plastic bags here too yeah let's see and the
uh-huh how about aluminum cans do they recycle that
right well the only part the thing is that it's probably isn't profitable to just from a standpoint of making new paper to recycle
but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer
down home i know my folks
live in south carolina and they have had some landfill filling up problems and they county built a new landfill and a site that wasn't geologically proper
so that the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away but they'll just won't have to build landfills as often
another things that they are doing not at home but in the offices here is recycling of paper and
that is done by separating the white paper which is i guess is a higher quality
from the miscellaneous paper
they have every office has two little cardboard boxes for putting in the white paper and the mixed paper
and big trash cans down at the ends of the hallways that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall
oh you know that's one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i use to get my oil changed when i go down to south carolina there has been a goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car for a number of years
and they have pretty economical rates but now in south carolina there is this
mandatory waste recycling fee and my daddy would like to get the used oil to pour over fence posts
so you know to make the fence posts last longer and weather better but the oil the goodyear store won't even
they say they can't give you the oil they say it's against the federal law now
and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee
so the only way you can get in south carolina anyway and they say it's because of federal law but you can get your used oil back is to do it yourself
right
right and then when you read about that they're spending all the money on you know these studies that have no relevance whatsoever
that kind of ticks you off too but
somebody was telling me the other day that they heard
some senator say that
what we're paying
it's not that we mind paying taxes it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government
and i tend to agree with that i'm not really into
what they're doing per se and i think there's just too many too many levels of bureaucracy
i think it can be
can be managed by
by less ah
less levels
right
right
right
right well i think we're gonna see
a streamlining in the government
i just you know i don't know what kind of
i don't know what level or what how long it will take for you know our country to start
the public in general to start saying hey this is too much we're not gonna pay anymore
you know we're not gonna pay for this and you're out you know i think we're starting to see it a little bit now but i think
i don't know what kind of
input we're gonna get from the public and how they're gonna go about doing it
because i think i think we're just getting taxed way too much
i mean right now we're getting taxed probably
probably around thirty five percent or more and that's you know that's me not making a whole lot of money
right
right
yeah we got a sales tax our sales tax is like eight percent and i don't know what our gas tax is i think it's somewhere around
twenty five cents a gallon
so
i mean they're hitting us up and they may not
they may not raise it
you know federally as much one year but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the or the sales tax or property tax or whatever
it's just
i mean
you can see that you're money is just not going that far
right
right
well
i mean you can tell just by
just by how much money you have left over and all of a sudden
i don't know it's just it's eating me alive
so well you're you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah you weren't supposed to want a job
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah but
but a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job
yeah
did you
um-hum
oh yeah
so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they're going to be there
but if you're going to be more professional oriented
then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that
that doesn't really go with the family
um-hum so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer is that what you think
oh yeah
oh okay you've found something else
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
and they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides
the same person every day
yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and
and if it's not
if it's not mom then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible
um-hum
yeah
well so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the father's attitudes about you know whose job is this
well it's his job too and i to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to
so
to yeah to yeah to
yeah well
um-hum
yeah
and you
yeah you talk yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
and a man might say out loud well you know i understand this and i agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and that's a very hard attitude to change
um-hum
hm
um-hum
yeah
and a lot of that is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas
and
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
but i think in between we got a group of kids a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because
mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility
and i think that's happened in a lot of cases
yeah
um-hum you know some time day care is really good but sometimes it's just it's baby sitting it's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any
relationship with the adults to say you know here's what's right and here's what's wrong and here's what we expect of you
yeah
um-hum
and i want
yeah the men have to be convinced of that
no
i crochet in fact that's what i was doing when the phone rang
yeah i'm making a baby afghan for my daughter-in-law's sister-in-law who's expecting baby number one at age forty
uh-huh
oh my
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
no i really don't in fact this is the first thing i've crocheted in some time
but my grandmother taught me to crochet when i was five years old which is a long time ago
so but i don't knit my something goes wrong with my knitting the gauge doesn't work
um-hum
hum i know i know
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah well i'll tell you how i sort of feel about it
i feel like of course in the olden days it was a matter of necessity
but it i feel like now that you ought to do what you really like to do not just because your neighbor or your friends or your sister or somebody else is doing it
the if it's not real recreation
it's not doing you any good
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
no it doesn't it you either do it or you either like it or you don't you either have a knack for it or you don't
and again i feel like that
if there's something else that you'd rather do
some people have a natural green thumb
and if that's what you like to do fine but if you don't
then get a second job and hire somebody
do something that you like to do
life is too short
i enjoy crocheting it it's real recreation for me but
and i used to sew a lot but and i just don't have the time anymore i just now barely keep up with my mending
but you know if you don't like to sew buy it readymade everything is available anymore and
hum-um dump it
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
good morning
as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area it just so happens that our daughter-in-law is panamanian
and we have been in panama and i have worked in el salvador and
oh uh-huh
yeah
it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit that's for sure
no i the us policy towards central america as far as well i kind of go back to the el salvador thing because texas instruments had a
a plant down there for a while and i worked in there for a little while and at that particular time let's see that was seventy three seventy four kind of before the
the civil war really picked up down there and us policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to the government itself you know anything that's
i wasn't really aware of it's being you know terribly you know rapid at the time that i was down there i think that really kind of developed a little bit later on
but our policies seem to be pretty much one of you know trying to setup businesses
because everything that ti did anyway we shipped in and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here so i didn't feel that we really exploiting them any
no in the particular incidence that i was aware of now ti wasn't the only ones in there playtex was in there was several other companies and
the time that i was down there i stayed quite a bit at the one of the big hotels san salvador and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against american tourists
because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious
as a as a group and i saw this in panama also oh you know it's the almost stereotype
you know flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know we're here and we want this and we want that and that sort of thing that's
that's the stereotype that's very strong down there you know that
i believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for
you know the local
quite that bad but yet they were having to deal directly with you know with the local people
and
but boy there is a there is a bad you know the old brash ugly american type
and of course now i do have to i remember one case where we had some canadians in there who were every bit as bad but i mean it i think it's just kind of the north american
situation in panama they've been used to americans down there for so darn long
but i didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing as panamanians are just about as jaded as americans as far as creature comforts you know they're every bit
i know when my son was in the air force and he was stationed in panama and he married a panamanian girl and when she came up here you know she's
except for the language situation some of the cultures she's just about an american you know is as far as tv and
and the local population kind of
you know sort of accepts that but i've also seen the other side of it too
well you were in peru
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh what area did you live in
oh okay yeah
i've heard of it
well
well is are they is peace corps still active down in there
uh-huh
did those
did those live on or were they reabsorbed or how
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's that was kind of the aim wasn't it to get it started and then have it
taken up by the oh okay oh so you know well that's
uh-huh
oh
yeah
my brother-in-law teaches at northern illinois university and they were in china here a couple of years ago and he was over there
at the university of shah and teaching
well
i've noticed some changes over the past thirty years
that
that it's gotten worse
i can remember back in the early sixties when i first started flying a light plane
it was quite common for me to take off from local airport here and see the appalachian mountains and the chesapeake bay at the same time
and in the you know fifteen years later it was a rare occasion that i could see both at the same time
yeah i know lot of times when i was coming back home i would file instrument flight plan just to get into the washington area
but i counted on north carolina having some good weather for me
well down there you get some more aromatic aromas like the smell of the pine forest and
then you get down wind of a paper mill once in a while
yeah
well i'm not sure that we're going to be able to solve much of the problem
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
well one of the reactions i have is that they put so much emphasis on the private automobile
as being a major source of pollution and they've ignored the trucks entirely
so i get to going down the expressway in the morning and i don't see very many cars smoking
but
then i get surrounded by twenty or forty trucks and they're just laying out a pall of black smoke
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i know along route sixty six the people who have residences there
they can't paint their houses without cleaning them first
if they're within a block of a major expressway the houses get coated with oil
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i'm not sure that we're not seeing some of the effects of that already
uh-huh
yeah
well we've sort of been seeing a little climatic shift here on the east coast or at least it seems that way that the winters have been milder for the last five years and
yeah
yeah the first the first winter i moved out here i had a big snow plow on the tractor and i had to use it we had three fourteen inch snows
and i haven't used it since
and at the same time i see some colder winters in the midwest i think they've gotten more snow in the past five years than we're having here on the east coast
yeah
uh-huh
oh i didn't know that
huh
well it may have been the fact we had this early season warm spell
that did that because i know that the preceding day thursday i got my first sunburn for the season out on ocean city beach
yes
i didn't notice that know that they'd discovered any thinness or over metro areas i'd only heard about the north and south pole
yeah
yeah that doesn't fit my picture of meteorology i can understand the poles because they're a permanent high pressure area
and you know there isn't that much circulation
but the temperate zone is a constant moving wind system
and it's i'm surprised that the ozone doesn't have it's own wind pattern
yeah
cold fusion right
the same thought flashed in my mind
yeah i
i may have put out an exclamation here at home when i heard that news
and everybody wanted to know why i was so excited and i tried to explain to them
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
i think so
except we might have bad case of paladium poisoning now
i know there was a pipeline going in up in
southern pennsylvania
and there was a group
in bucks county that was fighting it
and one of the women that was leading the group said well they say they're going to pump oil through there but before long they'll be pumping radioactivity through it
uh-huh
well i think that's wonderful my children are in college
but i teach school and i teach middle school age children
and so i see a lot of variation in what happens when kids are at home
i have taught school ever since my children were little but the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's and your holidays are too so teaching i think is a
a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids
uh-huh
right well with them being as young it was much harder when mine were young
and i really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his college work
and his master's degree and so forth and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a full-time job
um-hum
um-hum
yes it certainly is we
well i think that
we need to spend more family time together with children today we made a point to spend a lot of quality time and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were
involved in you know like through scouting or you know anything like that we participated and we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now
the kids were in high school it was harder to always have supper together but we did always have breakfast together
so we had supper together as much as possible but when it wasn't
feasible you know we kind of kept a master calendar
and when it wasn't feasible well that was understandable but we've always tried to spend time to talk and
have some time together time and we sat around the table we didn't sit in front of a tv or
that kind of thing so i think that's been important because we do have a close family and even though the kids are basically grown
you know situation for them when you know and their children when they marry and have children
um-hum
that's right they model and the with the dysfunctional families today i'm sure you with a as a schoolteacher also you see what happens to these kids
when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the between oh second families or
oh boy yes
um-hum
yes
it is
it is and i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children and i think we make a point to do that
because we see we see all the time the outcome of not doing that and i think if we weren't so interested in children in childfaring we wouldn't be teaching anyway
because i think the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools it's what's happening in the families and they expect us to
you know have create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers and you get to a point where it's completely impossible
and you just get more and more frustrated and yet you feel for the kids you do the best you can but
okay
what's your most recent one that you've seen
uh-huh
really i used to do that too but i haven't been doing it lately but
no see i haven't seen that one
no is it good
and movies like that
yeah
some i guess like what do you mean like are you talking about movies like die hard two or
okay yeah i liked that
that was pretty good
that was okay i don't i guess i thought it was too far fetched but so many people said oh no it wasn't you know but i guess
oh gosh
i can't think off my head do you know which one yours was
oh yeah well that's
right
really yeah you're right about that but that that's really like an all time classic i mean i don't think anybody anything could ever beat that
see i've never seen that
oh
oh really
uh-huh
that does sound good is it one i guess it's a rental
okay i may have to do that
go see it or go rent it
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
it's not david is it
really
huh
i don't think he's really a very good actor i know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful but i just have never been a stallone fan
oh
yeah i don't either
well it's so i guess i'm a real i'm a realist and so when i watch movies like that it's like this can not happen so i just don't enjoy it you know because it's just like
come on give me a break you know i mean i just and so many of them are done so poorly
you know that it just doesn't even give you the effect i mean some of them are done good and they do scare you but so many of them are just done real i don't know i'm not really into those
oh that was one of my favorites
yes i thought that was a very good movie
i was really impressed with that one i mean it was what i liked about it was that it was a new subject nobody had ever touched it before
you know and it was just it was done so well you know it was just
right well that's probably true but it was a very good movie it was done real well too i mean there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like
no this can't happen it seemed it seemed real you know it was really good
that was one i mean it's not my all time favorite movie but it was good it was really good
and i don't know
if you like this kind but i thought pretty woman was a really good movie too
yeah i've we've seen that two or three times we waited and we rented it you know but it was really good
no i haven't i don't know if i've even heard of that one it must have what's his name in it
no it doesn't
really yeah paul hogan
no really i'm surprised
oh
yes
oh there was another one what's the one that just
oh dances with wolves have you seen that yet oh you've got to see that one
it's really
right that's probably true that's probably true it's very good very good that's another one that i was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it
really
oh wow that's impressive
oh neat
oh yeah it's really worth it i mean it's a very good movie and yes i would suggest seeing it at the theater i know that they're still playing it and they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until like august
i think because they were they were scheduling a video release of it in july and then when it won all those awards
they pushed it back to august
so but yeah that one is definitely worth seeing it's really good
yeah and you know i didn't think that one was near as good
you know i guess it was okay i mean it was all right but when i compare like
the winners of this year and last year it just i don't know maybe it's not
hang on just a second the dog is barking
okay here in oklahoma we just went through a major educational reform we're that was a hot topic
part of the problem had been there wasn't enough spent on education the classes were too large
and we recently well we're through a proposition now where they're limiting class size to about twenty two i think and they've increased salaries and just done a major revision
yes yeah it's just about all
we also well no we have a an excise tax on cars our car tags are very expensive average taxes are very low on real estate probably in the five to six hundred dollar a year range
right
yeah i do have to tend to agree with you the only other problem with that is that it's difficult to attract people into the teaching profession
hm
right
right
um-hum
yeah
and that that's something you really can't change even with money
um-hum
yeah
right
right it's a it's a pretty big responsibility i mean to teach
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah see it like seems to me you know that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it's when it's just such a bad time for it you know
no
uh-huh
hell i mean mostly you know it's not actually a cut it's just a cut in the with hold in the amount with held you know
yeah i don't just don't see it changing my life style a whole lot
um-hum
um-hum yeah i mean you know in retrospect was it was it mondale or dukakis that said you know i'll tell you right now i'm gonna raise taxes
it was dukakis yeah i have a lot of respect for him
yeah um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah i yeah i think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where it would help unemployment greatly
and it
yeah our infrastructure is in is in i mean we we've hurt ourselves incredibly over the last fifty years of the cold war yeah
um-hum
i mean we this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen i i'm in college right now and oh really where do you go
right i go to georgia tech and in my i had you know the required political science class a couple of years ago
and one of the things we discussed was you know were where the budget how the budget situation just got so out of hand and essentially what happened was and i think it was like in the tax year of eighty one
ronald reagan basically said you know
i'm gonna give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and created this ludicrous budget that he knew that
that the congress would not in the right mind pass and congress realizing that they were gonna lose a the democratic congress realizing that they were gonna lose a propaganda war you know by you know by removing the tax cut
further cut the taxes and created you know that you know created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit
i mean it's just like you know playing chicken with a loaded gun
yeah
um-hum well yeah and what really bothers me is it just seems like if anyone were to say you know well i'm gonna raise taxes
and cut the budget and we're gonna have you know we're gonna we're gonna have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected
i mean it's kind of like rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where people just want to have
you know what ever will make them feel good right now you know and
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i don't i don't think george bush will make the american people happy with ninety seven cents a week
well i just don't think it was a well thought out incentive
hello
hi nicole i'm mary ann
i'm in mckinney
i see okay
sentencing and would all the jurors have to agree on okay that'd be a good place to start
all right
have you ever served on a on a jury trial
was it was it a criminal
okay
oh my
huh
it really does sound like it was a self defense kind of thing
no i served on both a criminal and a civil jury and in my criminal trial he pled guilty
to the first to kidnapping and so we went through the second part of the trial because in texas there are two parts first of all to find if they are guilty or innocent
he already said he's guilty so then we go through the trial to determine what punishment should be meted out
so we still went through three days of testimony and so forth and witnesses saying oh he's an upstanding young man just weak and was led by another guy and so forth
so we were the ones that came up with the sentence and the judge gave us some parameters and said you know
according to the law it can be no more or no more or less than and he gave the number of years and he said it would also include a possible fine
up to ten thousand dollars and we had that's that took us six hours just to agree
on what we thought was appropriate for this young man
it wasn't the easiest thing i've done but nor was it hard to us the young man had kind of taken care of it when he said he was guilty so we did not
we didn't have to struggle at all with that it was now what's fitting and we'd gone through you know all that so i don't know i thought that was easier than trying to decide his guilt or innocence yeah
i probably would not mind letting the judge do the sentencing
as long as the jury of peers were determining guilt or innocence for one thing we didn't know that the others involved in the trial had
and we couldn't know that until after we'd made our findings so it turned out we had done about what the other juries had done
and so it you know we felt a little better but i think if that could be in the hands of someone who knew the law and could be privy to that information seems like it would be fairer
since it's state laws yes
it now it may be on some
federal laws you know it this was a
capital murder or something like that it may be different
yes it would
i had a friend who sat in on a or who was on a jury recently for a murder
but the man was not being tried for capital murder and so that was not even an option
the death penalty was not an option
so and in this case everyone on the jury felt that it should have been and they were very convinced the man had no redeeming
qualities and couldn't be rehabilitated and they were they were really upset that he was getting off so lightly for the heinous crime that he had been involved in
a
background i'll take my job any day
i don't work with perfect people anymore than anybody else does but i can handle the imperfections that i'm around i could not work in the in
the criminal area for very long as a as a police officer as someone who works for the court system or whatever
so anyway back to the original question i really think i if we were still allowed to choose guilt or innocence
i'd be more than happy to let the judge determine the sentencing
i do too
oh i bet
i see okay
it probably is which is about what it costs you to park your car right
oh do they
oh okay
yeah
oh
i can see how that would be difficult
what about the other suggestion that they had that about the all the jury agreeing on the do you feel that is a requirement
that there should be agreement
i think i do too
um-hum
it's so easy anyway for everybody to just kind of become a yes man and get carried up along with the emotions and so if there's somebody who's strong enough to stand up with a specific doubt
i would a whole lot rather go through the expense of another trial because of a hung jury than that a justice not be meted out correctly
well it took us six hours to reach agreement yeah
yeah
apparently you all were successful in convincing him at last
well frank generally i keep on up oh listening to radio news listening to some television news the rest of it i guess what everybody's talking about
i guess if part of me says if it's that important i'll find out if i don't find out it's not that important into the way that it affects my life right now
do get the local newspaper you know and for a city of a hundred and eighty thousand people the newspaper is still very slanted and you know
you end up and you say well yeah okay and you
oh i would say maybe it's
a little morbid to the right now you know here we kind of talk more liberal and conservative rather than left right but it's a fairly liberal minded
but you know it's you tend to only get the one side you don't get kind of
a broad coverage of the reality of what happened
right yeah i guess i would think that you have a bit of an advantage in that you do have a an option for something that is more local and then something that is more statewide
here i guess really we're dealing with
the regions being
i hesitate to say sparsely populated but really you know we'll get to one region that's
several hundreds miles square and we've only got a few million people involved
and you know so regional coverage is pretty sparse and so we our next step from local tends to be virtually national or international
and i suppose you might compare it to you don't hear very much north dakota news
you know so
we can at times you know being you know being right on the north edge of north dakota we
we actually some of the current events are more an aspect of some sports interaction between north dakota and saskatchewan
and it's not hardly an current event as such but minot does a lot of advertising to bring tourist industry down
so you know we kind of get stuck with you get your local news or you get your news that's based nationally and so then it has
anything that intends to be local interest is quite localized toronto montreal ottawa vancouver that kind of thing you know so you're getting
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
yeah
it's yeah and you know i suppose of our television we with our cable system we get three detroit stations and we've got three saskatchewan stations with
yes we do we also have cnn which
yes yeah i actually i really enjoy their format and so it is it can be quite informative on an international basis
so i guess that would probably be my primary source for international news but not on a
regular prescribed basis tend to or i happen to be there and i'm and
okay we i'm presently living in a house first time
it was a really excitement to
to go out and select a house and have one made and built and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses
and as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in dallas fort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home
and they're good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart
so i would
not recommend f and j house for my dog to live in because they're overpriced
but they're a cheap house if you can't afford something good you know they're good for that and you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what your getting
the longevity of the house is not is not worth it
um-hum
um-hum
well that's great that's great that's i've heard i have another gentleman friend of mine who
nothing wrong with that i'll vouch for that
that was a big savings
well that's great have you been in it long
oh really well have you do you have any plans to maybe expand or move onward
first one's always a bear
we're having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us and that can basically be put on any lot in any state any you know so that's kind of the
we just got with him and told him what all we wanted and he's charging about a buck a square foot to design it and he's certified and registered so at least we know we're it's not gonna fall in or something if it's built but i have heard
that your approach is right you can actually go out and sub it if even if you don't wanna get hands on you can even just sub it out the concrete and those kind of things and that's kind of the plan i have so everyone i talk to i've
i file in my little book and do other things with it that's great that's great
sure i can imagine
if your happy with it that's all that counts
that's only you only have to satisfy yourself and no one else
ooh and that's a encouraging sign if you ever wanna resell it i guess
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right
i think i'm just afraid of what they're going to do with their nuclear warheads that they already have right now that they said you know they're open to anybody who's willing to pay the money i think ukraine said that you know if you've got the money for it we'll give you the warheads
yeah
oh yeah i mean
um-hum
yeah
well you know it's i guess the break up it's self was kind of unusual and then now all of a sudden
you know gorbachev who was in the us's pocket pretty much
is now gone you know and now we've got yeltsin who seems like he's a little bit of a hard ball typical
typical
oh yeah doesn't
right that's true
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
right hm
um-hum well
because i mean like you said they're not being paid very much over there and whereas they can command salaries of you know twenty thousand dollars a month
in you know these middle eastern countries that you know oil bearing countries you know
and i saw that they iraq and iran had offered twenty thousand dollars a month to nuclear scientists i mean
who wouldn't want that kind of money
yeah
yeah really
but i mean and these and these are guys that couldn't eat you know so
so
right
um-hum
um-hum well i think the us is eventually going to have to step in i mean you've got this you know big country that's now
pretty much in chaos because i mean the all the things that's split up and they've got the nuclear arsenal to you know pretty much eliminate the rest of the world
and they've asked for us support and i think the us is going to have to give in
because
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
no i don't think as far as bail out goes i'm thinking more on the sense of helping them take the infrastructure they have
and putting it to use i mean they've got a good infrastructure there i mean they at one time were you know they were a threat to the us i mean they had the weapons ability they had the manufacturing capability
and i think it's all kind of disorganized right now
right
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
hm um-hum
yeah
actually my last vacation was in connecticut we went home to visit family before that we were in hawaii
oh
it wasn't actually it when we were in oahu
yeah yes so where have you been
morocco really
no kidding and what did you just decide to go there or
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah oh i'm sure it was wonderful
uh-huh
was it hot
really
uh-huh
uh-huh i was born in saudi arabia and when my father worked there we they used to travel quite a bit all around you know in europe and whatnot but i was very young so i don't remember that
that area of the world i think would be great
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
really we found that in jamaica it was the same way that people would come up and try and sell you well try and sell drugs and things like that but they
they were so destitute and i guess they make all their money on tourism and they would come up and ask you
you know if you want to buy different things and really after awhile it really gets annoying you know it it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's great where else have you been
well you lived in france so you've been all through europe no
really
uh-huh
really
lots of wildlife huh yeah
uh-huh
now when was that when were you there
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
did you go on the barrier did you see the great barrier reef and go snorkeling
oh diving
uh-huh
uh-huh
is it really yeah did you have shrimp i've seen in you know they show all this wonderful seafood and great big prawns you know the big shrimp and
uh-huh oh you're adventurous you went by yourself really
really oh wow
uh-huh
uh-huh was it very expensive
no kidding no kidding uh-huh
uh-huh
all for a thousand dollars wow that really surprises me i guess i relate it to japan where things are very expensive aren't they yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah and you don't want to stay in the very exclusive because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're yeah wow
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh
that might be a lot to do with it i know a lot of it here in my state i'm from mississippi i'm not sure where you're from minnesota okay well a lot of it in mississippi here is got to do with funding
problems with our education system a lot of it's due money and they're trying to spend money where we don't have it and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford
well it is
right
that's true and a lot of it lot of it has to do with salaries too speaking of money because if you can't pay the right people you know they're not going to be able to do they're not gonna get the people that can do a good job
right i feel the
right i feel the same way a lot's got to do with how the kids were raised at home
and then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids i mean they've so severely limited
what disciplinary action you can do
exactly right
lose their job big lawsuit and all that
i feel that's got a lot to do with it people aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be
really we've talked some about it in my state because we've have a lot of well our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education but he wasn't
and a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly i know a lot a lot of if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system
and unfortunately there's not many places to get that money
then if you don't have
qualified teachers in the different subject areas i know one of my physics professors at college has -s addressed this that
most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists they're teachers and they may not know a lot about what they're teaching
where as they may have just had a teaching major
and then had some social studies courses and they're trying to teach social studies and they don't know a lot about that
where maybe a physics professor he my professor was a physics professor and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background in physics at the high school level
so therefore they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view and that causes a lot of trouble
right
exactly because i mean here in the county where i went to high school
one of the four high schools in my county one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado
so when they rebuilt that school they had a top of the line high tech school there and the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties
and then when evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them what they need to do to fix up this building and this and this and this
and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them
right
exactly
well you know it depends upon our weather here you know today was a beautiful day it was like summer day it was seventy degrees so
so i dressed in a light weight skirt it's a ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan
over it because i had some appointments at the office today some interviews and so i had to dress up anyway and then i wore heels you know
but when it rains a lot which it has been doing here a lot lately very often you know wear pants and boots
you know so how do you dress
okay
um-hum
yeah i can see i i've been a teacher so has my daughter and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring
that's right
that's right and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids right
yeah i do too so to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades older grades i had to wear heels
um-hum
well of course we wear an unlined boot you know it has a heel on it that's the kind of boots that i wear to work
and they wear them we wear them a lot with shirts and things
it's kind of a well i guess a custom down here
in texas that you wear these boots they're not a cowboy boot but they're just a real pretty boot but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain
as i have a private high school that i run here and so when i'm interviewing a parent of course i feel like i need to wear heels
you know and look like i'm a business person you know
because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle if you wear boots too often you know
of course you probably wear coats a lot
oh my goodness so then you had to
yes then things improved right
you know you know and that's very seldom we it depends upon our winter we have a few days you might wear a coat winter coat
you know but most of the time you can wear a sweater and we just don't wear coats much we often laugh about even when it turns chilly we're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that
i see
oh so you don't wear heels anymore i'll bet
yeah uh-huh
more practical
when you were teaching did you ever have a blue jean day or anything like that
yeah well i know that in some of the schools they have
country western day or something like that when you know or tacky day and i always thought it was kind of out of
got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too
yeah do you like iowa
where did you live before
oh well that's quite a change from california to utah
yeah i think so i like the new home improvement sitcom i like i like most of the sitcoms if they keep me entertained for a half an hour
no i haven't seen that one yet
i don't know my i don't know but you know my wife watches all those rescue 911 unsolved mystery things
drives me nuts
i just don't even like to be in the room when all of those are on it's like too much real life
yeah
i'll fly away i think i watched that that's where there there's a lawyer and he has a black nurse or a nanny
i watched that once when i think when it the first episode and it just didn't grab my attention
i felt like it was kind of they were trying to copy to kill a mockingbird without all the suspense or something
yeah
right
yeah
actually it's
the best time of the year for me for watching tv is starts around christmas and will end in april and that's for the college basketball
really get involved in that my wife played basketball when she was in high school and college so that's something we can both watch and keep up with which is pretty interesting at time
you know i'm not sure if texas won or lost i can't i don't even keep up with them or either my son goes there i just don't keep up with them
no my favorite teams are back east and they seem to be the best ones anyway so
it's
yeah well oklahoma's doing good this year it
yeah that where you are from oklahoma yeah
well aren't we all are from somewhere
well there's always actually i'll probably watch too much tv and
i think that probably effects me too just from watching too much
so yeah well i'm at home all the time myself and i don't work
and i never ever turn the tv on during the day
well
i'm just afraid i won't get things done if i if there's something there that keep me busy
i have a medical problem and i don't haven't worked for three years so
so that just i just stay home and
run errands do chores keep you know do the house work for my wife she still works and that sort of thing
what kind of a job did you have when you were working
yeah well
that's a tough question we're now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework right
well it has no credibility anymore
well i'm a school teacher and i'm in charge of raising them so i can appreciate it
oh good for you good for you
well you know it's interesting because when i heard the topic i was thinking this summer oprah had a tv show
about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible
and one woman had four children
and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family and that's frightening
and it's you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a
social issue
yeah people were siding with the husband saying you've got to go to work if you have these four children you've got to support them
and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them
that's true
yeah well you know i as i said i teach school and
gosh i'm trying to think i don't know i have one woman
one mother that i know is home
but she also has ten children
six seven and eight
in richardson
oh okay
oh yes
yeah i've got one child that stays with me everyday till five because his mother doesn't come home until seven and he doesn't wanna to be home from three thirty to seven by himself
um-hum
well he stays with me and i have a tendency to work late i work till six
so he stays with me till five thirty and then goes home
and you know i have lots of kids because they know i'm there late i'm a slow mover to say the least but they'll come in and say can i stay with you because i don't wanna go home to an empty house
and that's frightening because you know the when i said i i'm raising them i am because we're talking about boyfriends and we're talking about
what the girl said in class and you know what's right because there's no mother at home to do it
and
it makes a difference i've and just the social values
i don't know
i have a feeling we're gonna go more and more i've got a twenty one year old
female and i've got twenty two year old male
child children and
i listen to my daughter and she's going to work and she's going to buy her house and she's gonna get her car and then she's gonna have her children
and then when you know they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their lifestyle is
and they back to work and you know i agree with you i was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things
and we live without them we did fine
well i can kind of see it both ways because
you don't want to get i guess i generally feel against it but i can see why an employer wouldn't want to have employees that are on drugs
that could cause all kind of problems i'd would like to see it see them be able to not need to screen more than i would like to see them screening
and then if they say well i'm on drugs then they say well we would rather have somebody that isn't on drugs
that's right especially when they're trying to get a job and i guess everybody knows that if they're trying to get a job
that
if they put down that they're on drugs they're not gonna get it
right i guess depends on the job some jobs that on which public safety depends like pilots and air traffic controllers people who drive the trains
things like that but i don't think septa
right
but other well i don't know
every job
right i guess
i don't know i'd would
obviously an employer doesn't wanna have a person on drugs but if somebody's on drugs and they get into the work place it might be a better thing for them than to have them out there on the street mugging people
that's right
that's right if they now behind the drug testing was something like that so that it wasn't that a person just didn't get a job that
if they ever tested positive on drugs then they'd if that were the case then they'd be always unemployed
so
well some perhaps a program but
i know people go into programs there with other people that have a lot of the same problems and that's in some ways good it lets them feel like they have support
but on the other hand it's they need to be around people that have their lives together and aren't on drugs they need to be you know people wouldn't be getting into trouble as much if they
especially young people here in philadelphia
when they went home at night they were tired and they had to go to sleep
so
but if people are not working and they're just running around loose with nothing to do they got a lot of energy and it gets them into trouble
um-hum
right are you in business
uh-huh
right more or less for large businesses than small businesses i think mostly go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people they know would say about them
so with thinking about my daddy and working down on the farm in south carolina and hiring people and
you know even at fast food restaurants and
field work it's
the person doing the hiring and the supervisor going and talking to people and finding out who know what about who
right
that to be real honest i'm thinking about a truck as opposed to a car
oh
some other brand or something yeah no i just am i have looked for a long time i've had since i've been out of school i've mostly had you know german cars like
they're excellent cars and if you my i was a little partial to the mercedes i think i almost wish i'd kept it was old it was by the time i sold it was about thirteen or fifteen years old
oh jeez
that's the amount of metal that they have in them
that mercedes really i mean the way look at a car is they built you know they build this car you buy this car you can drive this car your whole life
i think they don't build them to hold up to that for something
yeah that's probably and all this computerized stuff is fine and good but you know something goes wrong and it seems like
i live in dallas
yeah
yeah i mean i don't know i just i do a lot of stuff myself because
it seems like if you take something to a dealership you know they are even more inclined to not fix something and just like replace the entire part
and they don't seem to really know how to do anything else you know what i call parts changers and so i get myself a little book and i start fixing a lot of stuff myself
if it's a very new one i wouldn't even begin to you know all this computer stuff just loses me i don't like to look under the engine of the car and not see anything i recognize you know
oh yeah
yeah i think because the whole system wasn't designed with that in mind in the first place so they just came up with something they could slap on after the fact
you know i mean if you really wanted to i mean you know if we can send people to the moon
we can sure have engineers that can sit down and design a fairly efficient engine that would also be good for the environment
but the you know there's no percentages in doing that there's too much i mean they can make too much money doing the doing the other way around or something
and i'll tell you know the thing i worry about is
that's strictly short term i mean that you know we know that our oil supply is running out you know and what happens when it does is what i want to know
i mean i may not have to worry about it because it happen in my lifetime but i worry about it anyway because i know it's out there
i don't know it's just
this well this is true you could just like have them out there i don't know in the pasture grazing and there's not much fixing with them either
i don't know i don't know that i'd want to have to rely on that as my transportation but
i don't know i just you know i've been looking at some things and like i say i've been looking at these explorers and these other kind of you know blazers and whatnot and you know they open up the hood and they say
you know it
i don't know they but they say they open up the hood they show you all these modern advances they've made and they show
right my i'm from originally from palestine over in east texas
yeah and the crime in you know in east texas is i think it's just about as bad the burglaries and the drugs and stuff seem to have moved out into that area
yeah but
yeah
right i guess it is really scary but the recognizing or i think recognizing that a lot of the crime in these smaller cities is really geared toward
the major cities anyway because i think that you know the people that are involved in the drug scene out in the rural areas are really out there to provide for the little you know the center cities
but right but i guess the question is what do you do
you know i think that from my own observation that a lot of it probably stems around the school system i don't want to blame the school system on everything because it's
it's not what they're doing it's not that they're doing so much wrong as that they can't not cannot do
a lot of the things that need to be done right well even not just education but even discipline and things like that
that the schools are not allowed to do anymore that the students you know are just they have so much control over the schools themselves that everything seems to turn around that
um-hum
right yeah
right
i do i travel a little bit in my in my job with i've got some clients in california and i was in california when the police out there beat you know beat up on that
traffic deal yeah it's a real yeah really was and of and of course everybody's reaction to that was you know anger and disgust and shock and all of that but then when you turn around and look at what's going on
from the criminal element probably that does not even compare you know to what goes on crimewise
and
yeah
yeah
but you know i really don't i don't know what the answer is but i think that if we don't find an answer
i think perhaps the supreme court has taken a couple of steps in the right direction recently i understand that they lightened up a little bit on some of the restrictions on you know crime investigation and stuff so
and you know yeah
right and say if you don't appeal
to start with then you don't have the right to appeal
and you know i think the
uh-huh
and it's
that's a fact you can
look forward to a just a few days in jail sometime for you know for what would seem to be a major crime
with appeals and all that and getting time credit for spending time in jail and i think they even give credit sometimes for the time they're out of jail between
between the time they're indicted and the time they're tried and stuff like that still counts toward their sentence
yeah
yeah that i guess
right but i don't know what
yeah
well i think you know back to back to the school situation the parents are the ones that demand all the rights for these students for the children
they want to put so much restrictions on and you know then they don't take on the responsibility themselves
and
so it's it kind of perpetuates itself eh
yeah well i've got two that are they're still at home but they think they're adults they're both out of you know out of high school one of them go to college
and i we really were nervous about our son the second one
going to school and you know richardson schools are some of the best around
and even at that it's you know it was a real touchy situation as to what you know as to
who the associates were there are students in every school system
that you don't want your kids associating with if you can help it
and you don't you know you don't have any control over it yourself
yeah
right
so
um-hum yeah it's we said you know that we'd have been a lot better off our children would have been a lot better off being raised in a smaller area
smaller town smaller school
or at least we thought perhaps at the time but you know
not so sure anymore we did have some friends that moved out into well out in rural collin county
thinking that would have been a you know a better place for their kids and before their kids got out of school the drug scene had moved in out there
and you know so they you notice that it's not a whole lot different there than it is
in you know in town
yeah
yeah
so
but well it's
yeah i'm glad that they're not expecting us to come up with all the answers on these phone conversations right yeah they you'd think that what
well everybody's concerned but you know we give congress and we give the state legislators the you know all these powers and authorities and everything and they spend a lot of time on it and they can't come up with the answers so right
so but it's
yeah maybe we maybe it's time for
there to be more people involved i guess in trying to find the answer but
and since you know
yeah well they can all they can do is enforce the laws they can't pass the laws and they can't run the court systems and
you know they do their do their job i don't i don't have a lot of complaints about the police myself
but they're doing
yeah we
um-hum well
that's my wife said the other day said she just couldn't do that couldn't be a police officer because you're you know you never know
what you know you stop by somebody for traffic accident and you walk up and they
they've got a gun pulled on you or you know something of that kind and
right yeah because
yeah you you've got a they get a domestic violence or domestic dispute and they get there and both of the parties turn on them
um-hum
yeah so
well
yeah
yeah
that's right that's like unconditional affection
yeah
i had a cat i've had several cats my cat
was hit by a car new year's eve but i'm gonna get another one as soon as i
get back in town i'm going out of town this weekend when i get back i'm gonna find a cat
so
yeah
yeah i work and go to school and it's kind of nice you know you come home your pet's there for you and wants to wants a little food a little attention
and that's it's kind of fun
yeah
no it was an kind of indoor outdoor it
it was well yeah i don't i don't care for the smell of a litter box so my cat was trained to go outside other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when you know it
yeah i think you know i like dogs but i think that i'm kind of like big dogs and you have to have room for them
and dogs take a lot of
a lot more care than cats do cats are pretty independent you know you feed them and they keep themselves clean and
if you if you raise them right you know you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to
let them out and take them for walks and
things like that
yeah
yeah
that's a major chore you know if you don't
if you don't keep up with it and kids kind of they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work
yeah
well if you're if you're gonna have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences take care of the offspring and
and i think you know when i was growing up we had cats
and you know just seeing the cats you know the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is that's a that's a neat thing to experience as a kid and understand and it was a real positive thing but on the other hand you don't wanna
you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know they're getting old now and it's time to get rid of them so
yeah
okay well it's good talking to you yeah bye
i'm a contract person at ti in fact involved with data switchboard
and do you work for ti uh-huh
that was excellent
well surprisingly enough i do too i get tired of sitting there and so does my husband but we both just thoroughly you know enjoyed it just really liked it
and i'm trying to think we went to see a
a real funny one i can't think now what the name of it was i've gone blank
oh we have not seen that we want to see that one
were you
my husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them he likes to rent them and so we watch a lot of them you know at home as they come out and yes
did you now i was real disappointed i'm a real big patrick swayze fan and i was really disappointed in it was one i don't think it was as funny as what i was anticipating and i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny
and it wasn't you know at all it was it was more of a love story and so i was really disappointed in that because i like him real well we just got through watching one with
is it claude van damme
yeah and enjoyed it i can't think of what the name of it was but it was a of course one of the typical you know kicking fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type move and we enjoyed that and
the one with jodie foster did you see it yes wasn't that excellent
yeah that was one that stayed with me you know for a month i just i kept thinking about it you know
no
oh it was excellent and of course he's such a very good actor anyway and i think he made the movie
you know
is it anthony perkins or anthony hopkins uh-huh i know i know it well i'm not a real big jodie foster fan but i thought she was good in that
no now i didn't see that one
no i like a good suspenseful story and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats in fact i want to rent it when it comes out for my husband to see because he didn't he won't go see that no i went with our daughter
and so you know saw it with her and enjoyed it my all time favorite is weekend at bernie's did you see it
oh i've seen it you know we saw it at the movies and then we've rented it several times and we just love it in fact we have a ten year old grandson that he and my husband and i we just sit there and cackle you know and just get hysterical
he's a big gene wilder fan
uh-huh he has a new one out and uh-huh i have seen it advertised i don't know what the name of it is
um-hum
yes
and my husband wants to see that one and did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the
the sheriff
blazing saddles oh that's my husband's all time favorite i think
did you
yeah
well i think they waste what we pay
i think they waste what all the money that we pay
um-hum
um-hum
no it's even it's even higher in dallas county so was it
eight and a quarter i think
um-hum
yeah
yeah because it -fferent at some point it goes up to thirty three percent and then the people that make you know five hundred thousand dollars and higher than that they don't have to pay sometimes they to pay even less taxes
no it isn't
what
no
right
i mean if they're in business and they're making money i could see if they're losing money but they're making money then they should pay taxes then
um-hum
right um-hum
right
i just file federal income tax every year
yeah i just got divorced so i'm single again so and you know it's a lot worse for single people because they pay the same amount as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married
um-hum
um-hum
right
whoever works less they get a tax credit for that
if both of the both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that um-hum
well it's two thousand now yeah for everybody
um-hum
then you get a you get a child care exemption but it's not enough you know i mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care and they only give you like
oh okay
all right
well on the budget i'm not for sure i wouldn't
start off first of all by putting a limit on the
members of congress
and then maybe we could get some new people in there to work on it
but other than the budget i think they just have to
i don't know i think they have to just have maybe
almost a like a constitutional convention and get sharp people from all over the country to come together
try to decide what we're going to cut i think we cut the wrong areas and
and just maybe start all over again
almost like family sometimes i have to do this call time out and then
um-hum
yeah
right
see down here in texas they just they don't they we don't have a state income tax and so they never want to raise taxes so they just raise the fees they just call them fees and there's a fee for everything
we don't have a state income tax and there's no the sales tax isn't on food
or anything like that so we
yeah so we're not taxed very much but the fees are pretty ridiculous
but i think we just may need to have you know get sharp people from all over the country
into some sort of a like a constitutional convention and then to say what's working in one place why wouldn't it work someplace else i noticed bridgeport connecticut's declared bankruptcy
yeah so
yeah and it happened i think michigan way back in the late sixties when soapie williams was governor they declared bankruptcy the whole state of michigan
so it's
um-hum
right
oh
absolutely
no by leaving
yeah by leaving that particular group in there to make the decisions it's not going change
so somebody has to get it to where that it's just a rank and file citizens around the country and the and like a
like a huge convention you know if they'd send
so many people from each they could do them they could do them in the state by state and then each state could pick representatives just like they do at political conventions
but you'd what it would end up it would be the same old people going so
some creep in there and so
yeah
right i think well even at the beginning of the country alexander hamilton wanted to put a limit
on
and maybe go back to a seven year term for the president
could you hold one second just a second ray
hello
that's all right my wife's a psychologist and i thought that might be somebody calling in for her
how are things in massachusetts after dukakis then
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah this is texas is trying
oh that's crazy because texas it looks like it's trying to bounce back a little bit but it's we've still got a ways to go
it's i teach in a college and i and i'm in a i'm in pretty good shape but some of these there's just a lot of people out of work lot of homeless
and the budget is just i don't we've got a new governor democratic governor female and
she's trying to cutback but she has to be so careful and that's the problem is that you if you come in too fast
you can't get reelected
um-hum
yes
absolutely
yes but
right
yeah
i mean there's some of the lesser crimes anymore probably you don't need to put them away put them in some work program
you know a minimum very minimum security and this they've got a job and you work
you know work this long some of them may find that they like it and want to take it permanently then you could just switch them over in another branch of that and pay them
a decent wage you you'd whatever you'd pay them would be a lot better than having them in jail or having them out on the street
it's a it's a lot
yeah
well i don't entertain that much anymore unfortunately but
if hum
well no i in fact i love to find different things i'm always searching for recipes that are different some things are traditional
okay we always have turkey for thanksgiving but there but i always try to add at least one new dish
i find it
interesting to
vary it
so that
but i you know it you can do a lot of things the meat is pretty standard usually i mean you pick a different kind of you pick whatever kind of meat you're going to have and
you can do a few things with it you know but i mean as far as salads or vegetables there are so many things that you can do these days that
it makes it quite a challenge and it depends on whose coming too
for a holiday family get-together i don't
make any you know i'm not real picky about exactly what it is but if we're just getting together you know for a family dinner then i try to keep it as fat free and as cholesterol free and you know all that other stuff as i can
right oh yes
um-hum
oh interesting
um-hum
um-hum
right
hum
right
yeah i could see that would be then it wouldn't be such a an overpowering flavor you know it would be just a flavor but not you know the real strong that's the only thing turnips have such a strong
yes
now you know speaking of vegetable dip i was introduced to something by a girlfriend of mine recently that i never would have dreamed of because of you know usually when you think of a vegetable
tray you think of broccoli or cauliflower and celery and the you know standard things have you ever tried using raw sweet potato
try it i was she i picked it up i thought it was carrot at first you know we were she just had a veggie tray and i picked it up and tasted i said gee this doesn't taste like carrot she said it isn't
so i took another one just to see if i could figure out what it was and i couldn't and she told me it was raw sweet potato and it is i do i do not like sweet potatoes cooked
hum
right
oh yes i hope so because of i've sure eaten a lot of it since i was first introduced to it
yeah but people are quite surprised to find out it's just not one of the things that you would think of putting on the vegetable tray
it is colorful adds a lot of color to your tray
oh i love that
uh-hum
um-hum
ten years we were in maryland my sister-in-law mailed us care packages of chili peppers and things that you condiments that you couldn't get for mexican cooking here spanish cooking you know that and now of course i can get them all
you know here in maryland too because it's become popular out here too and they have several mexican restaurants but when we first moved here twenty years ago we couldn't find any kind of you know
except for
yes well we have several
very well chi is very nice restaurants that serve real good you know mexican food but i know i have visited my sister-in-law in new mexico once or twice and it is
it's always refreshing because it's so she always fixes something different that i've you know not
well it depends on what you're making if you're making enchiladas it's hard to do that but well it's hard to let them add their own you know just to make it spicy you can even the enchilada sauce is a little bit spicy
well it's nice talking to you
well she has had she had one experience with child care services and it
was with she well actually she's had two she's had one with a babysitter and one with a child care service and i what she has done is to actually
find a way of working at home so she does not have to be a away from her children
it was kind of
that's right that's correct she was not happy with the child care service the particular one that she was with was
kind of well they just weren't very attentive to the children
each child is an individual and to be treated at a very early age as a math and say you have to do this at a certain time you have to do this at a certain time it just wasn't working out real well
that's right and i'm not sure about there in texas but i know here in maryland
we have had a couple of incidences that where child care has not turned out to be very good is it's been very bad
so you could you just can't
that's right and you can't tell beforehand she the second route went with an individual that she knew to care for her child and this was fine as long as the person was willing to do it
yes
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum that's good
right
right well i agree there my granddaughter is in a preschool and it has been the best thing in the world for her it has
right i understand and it is hard i there i work with a girl here that just went through a very traumatic change she has one that is six months old and another one that is three years old
and trying to i mean she has to work there is no choice
and but child care for those ages runs into a hundred and seventy five dollars a week
and
that's right
that's right and that's what i mean she's almost working for their child care the
right oh yes
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
right
well that's what they should that's what should be you know that is ideal
my middle daughter is interested in day care has been since she was in high school and they had a day care center there at the high school of course it was only for like four hours so it was really you know not a true day care
but she is taking classes and things to work toward becoming a day care teacher because she loves children so much but she's baby sitting now she has one of her own and she has three others
and she has three of them for their parents work shift work so she has three of them off and on for more than twenty four hours
so but it is hard and if you move into a new area
it's almost impossible because you have to know somebody that will recommend some place that you know is going to be safe and secure i would like to see more companies develop them right in the company
yes i do too
right
uh-huh
right well yeah
sure
that's right
uh-huh
right
well its been good talking to you perhaps we'll talk again sometime okay uh-huh bye
well i think that i'm self-employed and work in radio
and for me really i don't have to be terribly concerned about benefits outside because i own my own company
but the worst problem that i think out here is affecting people and i think would be the most positive job benefit is job security these days
yeah
well it it's a real problem out here because you know it's hard to imagine that you know ten years ago
i can remember where we really you know somebody would work for a local company here like kodak or xerox which are based here and they'd have that job for life
and you really didn't have to worry too much about that but ever since this reagan bush thing
every single time there's you know the first thing they do is they fire employees whenever there's a problem with the economy
and clear out the employees and we're losing more and more jobs and
yeah it's a real that's probably the biggest thing that i think people are looking for i put some things up in the comp dcom telecom thing regularly about job security with the at&t employees and
the communication workers of america and i'm watching as that progresses more and more and it seems to me that we're seeing a real problem with job security
being the number one focus it's no longer a question of salary or perks it it's just basic security to have that job
well i in
well i think maybe some incentives on the part of the government to retain employees
versus downsizing really why we're seeing that kind of downsizing is because of the increasing power of shareholders in the corporations of the country
whenever there's a problem with the economy or the stock value you know the first thing the stockholders want to see is well decrease costs which means cut employees
yeah california is really starting to feel the effects i think of the downturn
you know you guys have been pretty insulated for some of the past ones it hasn't hit as bad as it has out in the northeast here
rochester's luckily is a technology moving city i mean we have a lot of telecommunications and the like out here but
well cupertino seems to be one of the every single software company ever sees always sees cupertino you know
so you guys at least don't have those kinds of you know the only software seems to be still a us strength versus hardware
but you know the again in the future we're going to see the same type of thing even in more white collar work where we're going to have job security i think being the biggest focus
well i heard apple was remaking themselves into a consumer electronics company
yeah well the hardware you know hdtv if we can keep control of that looks like something that we could have good strengths on and there would be a lot of new jobs created
um-hum
well we i'm a home satellite dish owner and we have these arguments all the time about standards because of the video cipher of the scrambling system
in place and there's two separate arguments over whether we should have an industry standard which many people can build equipment towards or whether we want to have a system where
yeah it's a real serious problem in a situation of
oh no
oh i bet
oh i guess so have you lost him before
uh-huh
uh-huh
what kind of a dog is he
yeah
oh boy he's a big one then huh
yeah oh well i hope he comes back that's too bad how long have you had him
oh that's tough
yeah you get very attached to animals don't you
yes we have a dog a little white lhasa
and her name is angel and we have a cat who a white cat he's just a tabby just a and his name is dominique we call him neek but
pretty good we've we had the dog first and
she's kind of a wimp and the cat kind of rules but she likes him all right he we had another cat
about two years ago it got leukemia feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep and then we got this new cat so i
i have two children and they really enjoy the animals and then my mother who is very elderly lives with us and she's really good friends with the dog they're very good buddies
that's right
that's right they don't care what you look like or what you act like they just love you unconditionally it's wonderful
it's oh i know it has to be
uh-huh
oh
yeah
oh that's really too bad that's awful well
well i i'll i hope you'll find him you most likely will
well have you put any posters up or anything like that
um-hum
uh-huh yeah
um-hum yeah
no you sure can't oh dear
well that's good
they can keep their eyes open yeah that will help well
yeah
yeah he will i bet he does i know that it's hard on you i know that i'd be worried too
yeah isn't it though that is that's
yeah i know sometimes our cat will stay out all night and
when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him that somebody he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him and if he doesn't come by mid morning then i really get scared but he's always come back eventually so
yeah
yeah they can
yeah
yeah well but he's a real feisty guy he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property it's
he's cats are really almost
more territorial than dogs are they just really do not want other animals on their property they're very he just any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't he won't
jump at them or anything but he'll sit and he'll watch and it and he i think maybe he would if it came real close but he's very protective of our property
so
uh-huh yeah
well they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not they're very independent and
they're very he's very affectionate when he wants to be but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll just he'll you know either scratch you or run away but when he wants to be
he's really affectionate he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and
and snuggle up to you and but if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him so but dogs seem to be always in the mood they're always you know right there and like you to pet them and loving and so
yeah oh
yeah they do
hm
they sure do
yeah
is now do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go
and you have a fenced yard or uh-huh
yeah
well how did he get out
oh boy
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
oh
yeah
well you know that animals are like that they like to roam and investigate and
and see what's going on
no i'm sure that yeah
yeah how are your kids handling it
uh-huh
uh-huh
going to the ranger games and we named him buddy beaner for some reason but buddy after buddy bell so but he was he was a good cat too we miss him a lot and i feel real guilty because
we had him like for six years and one year i forgot to get his leukemia booster and he got it
and i just felt so i it's real contagious and it's and the vet said it runs rampant in this area and if they don't have their booster
any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically like they get it if the other cat has it so
oh it was i just felt terrible and i knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was he was just getting real skinny
um-hum
um-hum i agree with that
well i'd have to take a slightly different thing viewpoint i'm thirty five and
to me it's something a little more subtle it it's just a prevalence of computer technology and everyday life i mean
you know you know when clerks in grocery stores actually had to be able to add things up and in their head and check it
yeah um-hum
and it was actually quite and art form to see some of the you know older or more experienced cashiers go you know fly through that is like those japanese hippies see what the abacus is still
so maybe that's just a different viewpoint but i just
to me i can't even image now how they even produced books or letters before word processors you know then we'd have to through fifty iterations at least the way i write letters and things
yeah
right
right
yeah hey same here same here yeah
well we're getting greedy i guess but well with regarding to your comment i have to agree with that too there's a prevalence of
of two income households that you never really saw before although i probably on the exception of that my both my parents did work but most of my friends parents when i was growing up
the mother did not and it's simply not the case and
i think my wife in fact started to work part-time now because we'd started out we got married she had not wanted to work after we had our first kid and i said fine but now
yeah i remember that
i remember when i got out of college which was seventy eight people said now if you get a job with general motors or at&t or ibm
well you plus you know after the divestiture or well break up
right
um-hum
right
a strict requirement for me again what how serious a person is according to
you know what they want to get out of school and
i guess i'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home
let's see
now what was the question what what's the criteria for picking a college
what advice oh okay
yes
if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the they were unused to their
the way they run things i mean the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges i think the people are different and
you have to be more flexible and more willing to adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things you know you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across
country to something totally different than what you're used to
let's see what else
well climate would be you know you'd have to you know is somewhat if it's something different than the what they used to i guess
i'd also advise them that if mom and dad paid for their college that if they
that's right there's
the responsibility of that and
they could they could work and
earn money towards college and also if they stay within their state you get a lot more financial aid or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school
and like i said if they was willing to work in the summers
and also maybe then the parents could pay a third and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is by the time i have an eleven year old is my oldest so it's not too far away but it's
oh okay but it's getting there i mean we still have definitely can put away the money for college now
i would advise that they did not have a car at college they would
yes i'm here
no
i think so too i think i think because most kids don't have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of
and you know there's just i think it's just trouble waiting to happen so i would advise they didn't they didn't take a car and
i do tole painting
uh-huh i really love the tole painting
oh
it does it is real time consuming and
mostly i have just given them away as gifts
i've done perpetual calendars and
cookie jar lids and oh on and on you know just things like that but
i just work at stop and shop out there in ogden so
no i've wanted to do that but just haven't just haven't mass produced enough to do that
so i have five children of my own so it's
yes uh-huh i have my own saws and so i really enjoy doing that
i brush it on yeah i haven't tried a spray varnish
i use just a wood sealer
and
oh uh-huh
do you oh
oh do you
oh
oh well that is interesting so what kind of equipment do you have
uh-huh
boy it sounds like you're really into it that is nice
oh
yeah that is that makes it easier doesn't it well have you sold any of your furniture or
just
uh-huh
oh
oh well that's interesting do you did you take classes to learn how to do that
uh-huh
oh so yours is mostly just a hobby too then oh well that's interesting oh i would i really would love to go take a class in wood working and learn how to
i don't know if i necessarily want to do furniture but mostly
just do more uh-huh the wood working
yeah so it's fun
like i say i've made a couple of calls to texas and just talked to all different kinds of people so i think you'll enjoy doing it it's fun
you know there's a shop in roy that i really love and it's there by the copper mill restaurant used to be the hayloft
uh-huh let's see i'm trying to think of the name
i don't not right off
ben franklin okay
i'm pretty diverse actually i consider myself both a performer and also an enjoyer so i kind of get into all types i run the gamut from
alternative to rock and roll to heavy metal to you name it so i'm pretty open on that
country's not bad i grew up in nebraska so it was like yeah i listen to it once in a while but it's probably not my top mode i guess that's pretty popular down in plano though
oh yeah
huh
uh-huh
are you into the garth brooks thing at all or is that popular down there right now i know that he's kind of a big name right now
yeah
and you're also into the christian contemporary stuff
yeah i had a i had a roommate that was really into that he was into all the
groups like i'm trying to remember dmz
resurrection band what else
there are a couple of other ones he was into he was into petra as well
in fact it's interesting he he's actually an engineer i don't i'm going to school in florida
and he's an engineer that does sound mixing right now for a christian bands
so yeah he's pretty into it
it's been it's been lucratim for him
well yeah kind of like
but then now it's kind of taken a different slant and i think it's gone more diverse toward
not so much the head banging on the wall stuff as much as just runs
really a wider more eclectic
tone flow and things like that so it's i don't know i like i said i consider myself fairly diverse so
yeah i well i play the trumpet and also keyboards i played keyboards for about oh i don't know twelve thirteen years and played trumpet for about ten so
it it's good for a side diversion and a little bit of side income you know whenever i can do you do you play anything at all
yeah
oh wow
sure free time is not much of a luxury
i know that feeling
yeah
yeah well hey that may be more quality you know after all
yeah
joe scruggs huh
interesting
when you said scruggs i was thinking because earl scruggs is a real famous banjo player a real famous blue grass player
and in fact if you remember the theme from the beverly hillbillies
he actually played part of that
but
oh
yeah i haven't heard much about that no
yeah
all right yeah kids probably get into that quite a bit
i'm not quite at that point in my life yet so
it'll probably be a while before i before i get into the kids' music in at all so
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
well it's yeah it's hard to tell i know you know like in the appalachian mountain area there that thing's real popular yeah i've had some friends from west virginia that's you know that it's real popular around there
i think golf isn't it
are you a hacker
i know i oh i know i did i know i did course i know i watch my thirteen year old play now you know and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body
yeah
uh-huh
sure
ooh
what yeah well that's what it takes you need to play that often if you're really gonna get the handicap down
well i went to i decided this past year that i was gonna get out and start playing a lot more and i and i went after it and did
and i really didn't find much improvement fact every time i'd start trying to correct something it seemed like the score would come go back up yeah i think i need to
i probably need to take some more lessons more current and practice more often spend more time on it
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah oh yeah i'm familiar with it um-hum
oh yeah if you play regular i think it makes a big difference yeah
yeah i well i've also found too i try to work out regularly and when i'm doing that and feeling loose and that i swing better i get through the ball better
and i also if i found as i've gotten a little older here i worry less about my distance and i my control is a little bit better there so
um-hum
um-hum have you ever have you ever tried a one iron
uh-huh
well you know i put mine back in my bag this year too and i used a three wood rather than a driver i had a lot more control on it i sacrificed distance but i wasn't in trouble every time i got down the fairway
um-hum
oh yeah absolutely
yeah well i read recently here they say if you're playing if you're scoring well you should play more
if you're scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice range i think there's less frustration factor there too you know you
so but i've the one iron is something i've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that i should pick one up and try to start apparently they're very difficult to play with but with practice i would imagine you could group that swing too
and i play with a fellow that can knock a one iron it's incredible and but and his accuracy is what's so startling with it and i and it but it's an iron that he's really practiced with he's used a lot
and i it would be fun to get that good at a with an iron distance iron like that
here we go
okay janet could you tell me what your thoughts are
yeah they
the example they gave was like the peace corps
i'm not so sure if i agree with that
see
back in roosevelt's administration they had the ccc camps
and i don't know about down in your area but
like up here they built bridges and they built waterways leading from reservoirs to reservoirs to get to the city
in fact in my area it's kind of a rural area and it's and the waterways are still in place you know they're beautiful they're all stone walled
and
it just leads from the reservoirs way up in the hills and it just leads down into other reservoirs some of the bridges are still standing too i mean some of them need repair now
but because of
the recession back then or the depression whatever you want to call it
there was a lot of people out of work so the government brought them in i mean they performed a public service
but yet they were paid for it too
right
right
yeah but they must get some compensation somewhere
was it like a sabbatical
yeah
yeah like yeah
yeah i think i think we need it in this country
right we're
you know we're supposedly on the leading edge of technology which that can be disputed i guess by a number of other countries
i do now that our rapid transit system is in terrible shape i mean most areas of the country we don't have anything
where overseas they do their rail lines their
if we put
if we put a force to work in this country building
a network of rapid transit systems you know just from say outlying districts of downtown especially california where the i saw a program on pbs last night they're saying the average
the average speed on the california freeways now in southern california is thirty six miles an hour and it's roughly
a two hour wait to get from the outskirts of downtown
and they figure by five years the average speed is going to be eleven miles an hour
that's atrocious
now the military's laying off
i think there should be mandatory that people that are not in school should at least get into some kind of a career program i mean they can help build the united states back up
yeah
and we've done
we've sent
people abroad and the people that do go abroad are usually
college educated
they're taking the knowledge that we have and bringing it with them which is which is fine because
in the long run if we educate those people and we build up their economy they're going to want to buy products that we make
but i don't know if that if that is really taken place like the philippines with the massive corruption in there i mean a few people got it and the rest of didn't
the middle east same thing a few people got it and the rest of them don't so in theory if you build up their economies and help these people yes it can work
but the corruption at the top i think limits that
yeah
yeah i'm kind of a dreamer i guess i still believe in
we could put this country back to work we could bring the steel mills back in we could we could build our own rails we could we could create all kinds of jobs
if we just had the incentive like
i'm not sure who started the national
highway system you know the freeways
we could do that too i mean we could we could get a national program
kennedy had a national program to land a man on the moon
and we did it
yeah there's i just remember how it used to be and it seems like that
everything's just deteriorating you know you can't go anywhere without waiting in line you can't
yeah it just seems to be a waste of time
i mean it takes it takes longer and longer to get back and forth to work
we're adding to the pollution in the in the world whether that's creating the greenhouse effect or not whether it is or not it's still being debated
yeah
it could the main thing is
like you said earlier in the conversation
if we make it a mandate and say you have to do it then we're going to create all kinds of problems
but i don't see why we can't say that i don't see why we can't you know you contribute well
you don't go to school well spend two years doing something
we have a welfare system that
is defeating itself because they get more money from welfare than they can working at
ordinary jobs
so what's the incentive for them to go to work
the prison population right that's there's i don't know how many millions of people now are incarcerated
which is which is a huge drain on society
what do you do with those people
yeah but are we really doing that educating i suppose some
no
and they're going to be apprehensive and if you had to choose between one or the other
you know you just wouldn't look at those people
well actually to tell you the truth not very well i resigned from texas instruments not shortly
ago and found that my after having worked there for
twenty one years
my vested interest in my
pension fund was amounted to less than three quarters of a year of salary
i don't know the i guess the that issue was a ti retirement benefit is it is what they call a defined a defined benefits program which means if you retire you get benefits
if you don't retire you get shit
but i think the government sort of passed some kind of legislation some long time ago that said well you can't do that you can't just kiss them off if they don't retire
and so there's some nominal
amount that has to be vested with the employee
but in this modern day and age where there is job mobility i mean
it's time for employers to stop screwing the employees out of their retirement benefits by
invoking this defined benefits plan
right
right
which is all the more reason i think that the employee should have control over his pension account
of course the initial question that was asked related to actually i can't remember anymore but to
career gratification and you know that kind of thing
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
boy i there were some something happened to your signal at that point did you notice it
yeah
in california
or whether it's part of the switchboard system
yeah
it is it i love it it's a wonderful place but the price of housing is
is just totally
looney
well that's true up in redding housing prices are probably comparable to dallas where i came from but down here the housing prices are
about a factor of five higher which is really ridiculous
at any rate
affordable cost of living
of course the most wonderful thing for the company and the most wonderful thing for the employee too is if what you want to do is to work
not so great for the family but
uh-huh well having been there not too long ago and my wife having only recently completed a doctorate i'm fairly full of it of it myself
the main point that i have about
choosing where you want to go to school
is that
you have to early on define what it is you want to do
or at least what area you want to be in
i had the unpleasant experience of going through several
schools that were very specialized
i went through a number of them undergraduate schools
being an engineer now i believe in it even more strongly than i did before
well thus far it's working to my advantage
the great gap historically has with engineers has been while they may have all this technical information they have no way of imparting it to except to another engineer
and i have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that non engineers can understand
well it's a lot of fun at the moment
even at that i have a son that who is only nine at the moment but i see him very rapidly becoming
the engineering personality and if he decides to pursue that
i'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college before i'll even let him go to an engineering college and yes that'll add one year to his education experience
yes it is
oh i agree
i have the experience the last school that i went to was mississippi state university which is
historically an engineering and agricultural school
the typical land grant university every
state's got one
anyway
while it has both engineering and liberal arts the
engineering students tend to cluster together you know they're in classes together even when they're outside of the engineering department
and they don't learn the communications they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of endeavor it's you know it's kind of like
if i were king for a day and got to and got to make one rule
my rule would be no one could get out of high school without an entire year of philosophy
and it's
that's not even true in our colleges
right
yes i
i remember that experience
that and extra music classes
well that will continue to grow
even as you
go beyond graduate school
have you gone straight through
that's true are you pursuing a master's or a doctorate
well let me let me encourage you to stop and experience life along the way
i first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty six
six years and a
and a war later i got a degree an undergraduate degree
and then
fifteen years after that
i got the first of a set of master's degrees and four years after that i got another master's degree
oh yes
it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier
well vicarious learning is a wonderful thing you know it certainly means that we don't have to experience everything but experience is a wonderful teacher also
my wife as i may have mentioned just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago and she pursued her education along the lines that i did
with lots of break in between and she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now she has an awful lot of experience to draw on no longer
what do you do
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that
no i remember when i was in college i didn't have time to do that stuff either it was really
yeah but now you know i don't have a whole lot of time now but
i have more time than i did so
oh
uh-huh
yeah i
yeah i just have you know one brother and he's married and you know they have a couple kids so i you know i don't have
you know i don't get on the phone too much but yeah most of my stuff is just going you know i enjoy going places with my kids and
i do like sports but i'm you know i don't have a lot of time for them my i like volleyball of all sports i think that would be my favorite because i hate basketball and
and
you know i'm the opposing teams best player so to speak so
you know just i you know i have varied interests and stuff and
yeah
uh-huh
i love to read but i you know i don't have a lot of time to read and
you know what reading i do i kind of do because it's you know it's the necessary stuff as far as fun reading you know i maybe get to read the sunday paper but
that's about it you know so
and just you know keeping busy with everything else going on so
you know you make clothes for them and everything like that
so i do things like that you know if i had more time i'd probably do it and sell the stuff but you know i don't have enough time to do it to really you know take orders on it and
you know it's like i can only do it when i have time i have a whole stack of material and patterns to sew up as it is so
oh yeah uh-huh yeah i do i've done those too before yeah
and satin you know and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that so
yeah
uh-huh yeah those are fun to do and
just little things you know i didn't have a lot of when i was in college i did you know i did sewing for other people when i had time
you know like if somebody needed a bridesmaids maids dress made i'd make that but that's about all the sewing i did i never had time for you know to sew myself a new dress or anything like that so
but
yeah i just kind of sew for my kids and that's about it
so
well i guess maybe we've covered the topic pretty good
down there and
we had a small farm house out in castroville which is just to the west of san antonio
and we did a lot of gardening out there and mostly in raised beds so we could keep the soil nice
because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to grow very hard to cultivate
and when we came up here to california we're in the monterrey area and it's very nice sandy soil rich soil
and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow
so we've been out here well really in the house since december and we've been planting flowers that we could never plant in san antonio
because the heat would just dry them up after you know about three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started
and here they are supposed to last year around and so we have some really pretty flowers growing and we're at the edge of a forest area so there's a lot of pine mulch
just about anything you would want in texas as a gardener is here just around us you know
we got here at the end of about a four year drought
we've had a whole lot of rain it's been raining pretty much continually now off and on maybe one day of break for about a month
so yeah we're getting replenished and so there is
when i first came here it everything was yellow the grass was dead everywhere
and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful and i hope that it holds out here after the summer
but that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and
and waiting for the rain to subside so we can mow we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend
but we're just so happy to see green it's just so nice we haven't really done too much else other than that
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh okay does that last through the summer too
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
just get grass to grow i know
uh-huh
well when we had our house out in castroville the problem with ours is that the plots there are a third of an acre and
and to water it and eventually well especially when it was so bad last year well i guess it was the year before now it was so hot that year that was the year that i think it started out a hundred in february
we were just watering all the time finally what we did was we said we're going to have to let the back yard die it's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because we can't really afford the front yard
and so when we left you know the back yard had
and the saint i think it was saint augustine that we had it had held onto a small portion but primarily once the weeds start in the back
yeah we were just you know resigned to well the only way we were going to fix this one is that you know if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again
but i don't know that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money or you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive
that was the only thing i didn't like about lawns and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay plano uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i imagine so well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular
especially in the dallas area you know there's so much money and everyone can afford they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn and
another thing i've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes the area is so small that they take great pride in being able to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right i know oh it's awful the first house well our house in castroville was the first one too
and the time that it took especially when you start mowing and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water
and the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it people that were building the new homes that put those in
that was
that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient they would just turn it on and the timer would run and it would water their lawn and they didn't have to worry about it at all
and that was so nice but we didn't have that luxury so we were dragging the sprinkler around everywhere and
so i hope you can find i don't know what type of grass grows in the real shady areas i remember the guy that was on the radio
they had a gardener
and he i don't know i had this one well i've still got the book it's i think it's just called texas gardening and it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas
and but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant but i don't remember what it is but it's got like a boot on the front of the book
it's just a real fancy decorated boot it's like texas gardening
and it talks about you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to how to prune
but i don't i don't remember if it was raleigh and saint augustine or what but i do remember they had used a blend
uh-huh
oh
but that's so neat because so many homes don't have that so you'll be cool all year around in the summer that's great
uh-huh
it makes the biggest difference
when you have the big old trees
so oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there
oh that's even better
oh
uh-huh
well sid have you established what kind of requirements you're looking for your next vehicle
okay well i tend to
be more methodical i guess
first of all what i'm gonna use the vehicle for
whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a personal mover where it's gonna be driven you know what types
of driving
i'm going to be doing on it primarily highway or local mileage more often
and
hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that i tend to drive cars for about ten years
at a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles
so i'm
sure well it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways a also then
that's true do you have
more than one vehicle in your fleet do you have a family fleet or
well that may be they chrysler made some really good old engines back then like the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine
reasonably new plymouth voyager it's only a couple of years old
but that's the second one of those that we've had that's the family travel vehicle you know not only does it do all the
the carpooling around
during the week but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in
i think that what i'm getting ready to get next is probably a suburban unless they drastically change
the
the vehicle a lot i'm just getting tired of
when i do get hung up in traffic not being able to determine what the problem is and come to some resolution
of
whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit that kind of stuff just because i can't see
yeah i'm too my cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that i can't see past any vehicle that's in front of me
certainly the weather here is warm and it's been sort of raining on and off
and i'm an avid gardener so i measure the rain in our rain gauge on a on a regular basis so i can avoid wasting money on watering
and but it's been threatening to rain for the last couple of days and it has not really which is a bit of a disappointment but it is very warm here which is typical for this part of the time of the year how about
it starts in march as a rule
really this late could you have snow
oh well that is nice
and then it stops for three months
right
are you in an agricultural area
well i know the i know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of off of the land
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum well you know there are some disadvantages to being down south and that is it gets so hot that you know a lot of things die during the summer from the heat
they really do and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered
yeah well my parents are now in san diego and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't almost nobody there has lawns
yeah it is very it is very rough on them so actually i think i think it is pretty moderate here in dallas because the summers are extremely hot
i don't know what it is percentage wise but i
yeah it's drier in dallas than it is in houston or san antonio or even austin which is further south but it is not dry and i have lived here for many years and i think it has gotten more humid over the years where the water is coming from i don't know
oh does he live near the lake
uh-huh
um-hum
that's a problem they tell you when you are looking for a house or buying land to build on to be very careful and check the drainage because it is it is deceptive
and i know exactly what you mean
uh-huh
oh well that is fortunate
um-hum well i like it i like it here i grew up here i have lived other places and but i did grow up here and this is very much home for me and
i hope you visited during the winter one of my one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter and you go to cold cool places that well i go to cool places during the summer if i can anyway
well yeah basically i do too
well i that is really healthier frankly
um-hum
but you know it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot now my sister is a sun fiend and she is five years younger than me she is more wrinkled
yeah and i think that's why
exactly
i think it burns off the i don't know the theory the scientific principle but it burns something off the natural oils or something like that
yes
yes that sounds like a good that sounds like the right theory
good
well that's great it's been it's been very nice here too and i hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening and i want them to have nice weather
for their visit instead of driving around in the rain
probably four or five days
thanks
yeah and the same to you
a pleasure
i'm sure i will in fact if i hadn't been preparing for this the out of town visitors i probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days
okay
i'm basically into
oh just rock and roll
i'm a little bit of everything jazz reggae rock
i'm more into the i'm twenty three so i'm you know i used to be in a band and hang around all that stuff but i'm
pretty much into
more classic rock now probably you know clapton lynyrd skynyrd
but i'm also into you know jazz and stuff and
i'm not into the dance stuff but
so what are you into right now
um-hum
right
i like some clint black you know some garth
yeah i've gotten into that more lately the last few years i used to just totally not even listen to it but all my friends are into it so you know it's just
i'm pretty much handle anything you know
christmas music yeah around christmas sure
but
it just depends but i'll probably say rock
you know
not heavy metal so much anymore but
i kind of grew out of that it's a little irritating now i guess i see why my parents didn't like it when i was
in junior high but
oh yeah they can't understand the heck's going on
no just regular when i was a kid probably but
it's
just
not i don't irritate anybody with it
right
yeah as a matter of fact
the other day here i was
i was downtown a sale call working and
van halen i don't know you might see this in the news they put on a free concert
and out on calls and we just happened to be about a mile away so we went down there to the west end district which is
real nice
downtown area which is a big hang out for a lot of tourists and stuff so they put it on and
it was unannounced type thing and they announced it like two hours before the show and we just happened to be down there and
it was a little riot almost broke out so it was we happened to be in a restaurant across the street you know nice seats but
yeah i used to do the concert thing when i was younger but i mean it's just
now i mean you want to lose your hearing
god i mean it's just
i used to go out with my friends and stuff in high school
oh yeah but
just it's not
i don't know i mean with the prices and you know thirty five dollar ticket and there's not really that
anybody i really want to see for that much amount of money now you know
no i don't even
i was in a band in junior high i played baritone but
that wasn't
that was just more or less you know for the heck of it
how to be a well rounded individual i guess so
oh yeah oh yeah
um-hum
yeah my ex-girlfriend's dad used to be in a drum corp or whatever
back in and they were from up north i guess it's real big up there
they're from wisconsin and
that's one thing he was always really into that i just remember
it
i'd seen some
they have these competitions like once a year out here i know it's just drum corps that come out and i've never been to one but i mean i know it's i guess they just have their
well i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home
that's probably even one of the major changes i see over the last period of time
oh i don't think so i think it's come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities but i still think in lots of job markets they're not treated as equals in the words in some in some respects the other direction that in some job markets they really don't wanna be treated as equals
yes i think that's generally speaking pretty true and i think that's what we really ought to look at that going is if they're gonna do equal work they ought to get equal pay
and that they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions and i don't think we've gotten there yet
oh boy
i think it's generally that switch over and i and i think that switch over has been more in the work force i don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force
i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband's having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home so they have one and three quarters jobs now
whereas the husbands have one and a quarter
yeah
yes yeah and i think also in terms of parenting i think there's gonna be some increasing problem because i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting and i'm not sure they're becoming any more skilled at it
because i think it really has put some additional stresses on family units
well i think one of the things that always happens is i think we'll swing to one end whereas you know where were moving at to the end where a lot of women will be at work
although so much of it's driven by economics right now people have gotten out and gotten use to two incomes coming in
yeah
well i think they ought to have the right i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to and or my wife or my daughter's going into combat but i have problems with men doing that and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it it's nothing i'd be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for
i agree
well i think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit and i think i see some change in attitudes there my wife happens to be a wife who's chosen to stay at home
and there's a has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she'd be out in the work force and fulfilling herself
and i hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do that's acceptable if they chose to go into the work force that's okay if they choose not to that's acceptable
as equals
well i think that the majority of the problem with the school system
is similar to the majority of the problem in a lot of other areas in it's a question of economics and the school system is not designed to be successful
by that it's not really profitable
for good teachers to be in the school systems if there are good school teachers good really qualified people as school teachers it's because they're dedicated not because they're rewarded for doing so
the public school system needs to be viewed i think kind of like
the highways and hospitals and everything else it's part of the infrastructure it's something that has to be and has to be you know highly maintained in order for the nation itself to be successful and when you
when you neglect part of the infrastructure be it the roads or the schools or whatever then everything kind of follows with that it's just a question of how long before you pay the price
hm
hm
yeah i'd heard something as a matter of fact kind of along those lines with i think it was the new york school system
where they suddenly instituted a sort of market system where basically the kids were allowed to take whatever classes they wanted to and go to whatever school they wanted to and it was up to the schools to attract the kids
the rate of graduating students went way up and they ended up taking real courses but it was because they wanted to and because they chose to instead of were being forced to and
and the people were forced to compete and the good teachers were getting the students and that kind of stuff
sanitation engineers
yeah and
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
they have socialized health care
how do they pay for it how is it financed
oh
yeah
well i feel like something needs to be done here and i'm definitely in favor of the government i just think you know medical costs have as i've seen over the years just go up and up and up and already just this year
you know i'm a single parent and you know i have to pay for medical insurance and
it's just outrageous my son you know has got allergies and he's got this and he's got that and he broke his arm i mean and you know it's a thousand dollars here a thousand dollars there
and you know even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it you're pay an arm and a leg for the insurance first of all and then you're still paying yeah the twenty percent and so
yeah
or they can't yeah they just can't
yeah i've been in positions before where i've had to wait a few days you know to have a prescription filled because i just didn't have it
and i don't think that that's fair i don't think it's fair you know to the kids and to the people that are sick and i know that you know
every city has you know their you know their free hospitals or whatever and i know a few people that have had experiences in those
i've been fortunate enough not to but i mean you could go down there half dead and wait you know it's hard to see a doctor from what i've heard
well yeah there's a lot of people that you know don't work
you know and don't have it you know any other means they've and so they either again don't have it or they have to take it out themselves and pay an arm and a leg for it
you know i'm thinking of you know i just did my tax return for the last year you know if your medical bills are more than a certain percent of your income
you know it's worthwhile to itemize and last year i was the first year we reached that mark
where my medical where it was worth it to itemize for medical expenses because they were just they were that much of a percentage of my income that it just
um-hum
um-hum
oh at least at least
oh it's out it's outrageous and then a lot of companies you know offer you know you can have a certain amount deducted pre tax from your pay check for medical expenses but not covered by insurance but
you know that's something that's something fairly new and not a lot of people take advantage of it but it's you know it's use it or lose it and i
you know get a big crown done you know things like that but
i know
yeah do you think that the insurance and all they've got in europe does it cover dental or is it just medical
um-hum
yeah
what motivates people to go into medicine are the doctors you know how do the doctors
they do so they're getting paid
yeah
i yeah i don't know either
yeah
yeah
i definitely agree and i remember back in high school being on the debate team and that was one of the subjects one of the debates should we have you know national health care and i remember debating for it
yeah
yeah right
i don't know it's going to be hard to switch i think that we're going eventually end up end up that way though i just don't see how we can yeah i think it'll take
i agree it'll take a while but i think we have to be headed
have to be headed in that direction
nice talking to you too
first person from not from texas that i've talked to
okay you too bye-bye
well i guess you said that you're a you're engaged so you really don't have a family budget to manage right now right
well that's good
right oh that's good so you're really planning on how to how to manage money from the beginning and that's a good time to start
we've been married twenty five years and we find that you know money management is really important we
don't have a lot but we still you know manage it fairly well we don't have a formal budget
we have just found that
by trying to practice paying our bills every month especially our credit card accounts
we don't spend more in a month than what we typically expect to be able to pay at the end of that month
or when the bill comes
we find that works pretty well for the most part
excuse me
are you planning on having a real budget and setting up a monthly amount to spend or
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well now then i guess that's really you know the idea of budgeting we know you know how much money's going to be coming in and we know what we have to spend so we
don't you know we don't go out and spend a lot of money that for one thing when we need it for something else
and i guess that's a budget in a sense
it's strange i'm an accountant and my wife manages most of the money so
you know i manage other people's money but or you know help them manage their money
so i kind of let her manage ours and then you know if there's any questions come up you know we discuss it and work things out whatever needs to be worked out
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right it yeah you have to i think that's the a good idea for both you know both parties to know what the finances are
then there's not ever any you know any question about whether or not the money can be spent or whether it's being spent properly or if one person knows that if both parties know that
what has to be spent then there's not going to be
i've already said that no questions
and then plus if there's ever any you know tragedy or anything in the family then both parties are prepared to take over control of the of the financial situation for themselves if they have to
it's i've seen it seen it happen where
one party or the other managed the money
uh-huh
yeah
yeah in just
yeah well that's great
uh-huh
yeah so that's pretty good and it's you know it's good that you've got that background of managing and saving as much as you can with today's economy
because you know things are so uncertain that you really have to watch you know be prepared to
you know to cut spending when you have to
but you know it's money management's really an important thing you know with today's with the situation the way it is
right
right
when they you know twenty years later and they've already reached that point where they're spending everything they're making
yeah and they well they got their lifestyle geared to spending everything and they can't cut back enough to start saving so
if you cut back to start with you know you'll find you'll be surprised at how easy it is to you know if you start off saving and just continue to do that
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
so that's real good
well any other anything else that we want to talk about on budgeting
okay
well it's been nice talking to you
yeah okay thank you bye-bye
no i don't like the metric system
i think the country is too ingrained in the inches and just the general background the history of our country has been inches and i don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system
it it's gonna disorient it and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand
you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is and
it's not in our national consciousness to do it we've always measured things in the english system
and you know everything you know our land is in acres our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is
yeah
yeah
and it's easy to we have a computer for just about everything now and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done
because i'm a mechanical engineer and i've had to work when i was designing packages for people i mean i had to work both systems back and forth and it was not hard
and you get you can get a cad cam system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and it'll convert every
measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds
really
yeah
absolutely
oh yeah it's just
or even have had the ability you know the chance to go to college or to learn about it i think it's still good they do cover the system and i think it should still be taught in schools
you know we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements and things like that
and that's acceptable
because
yeah
really
yeah
yeah
you know that's fine and the rest of the world i mean we are if not we may not be the top i don't know if we're the top we're one of the superpowers of the world
it may be arrogant but i mean let them come to us
that's kind of the way i feel about it we can convert
yeah it it's kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak german
you know
okay
yeah i -'s been nice talking to you
okay
yeah
-ell good talking to you
bye
well let's see it turns out that i work at tektronix and it's a very
how shall i say it walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and
well walking how shall i say it kind of
like avia
walking shoes
just reasonable looking
how shall i say it
sports clothes or well some guys wear some people even wear levis
now being from philadelphia i don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed right
oh okay
um-hum
yes
i just recently
applied for a different job in the company here and
so i
decided well i'd wear a suit and it was very interesting like i said most of the people at this company don't wear suits most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual almost the same clothes that you'd wear to school
from a much more formal eastern background
and so the result is that so anyway i wore this suit and i went over to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it and it and
the just to kind of
it was obvious that people didn't know
whether i was a worker bee or a manager
so people how shall i say it made a
made much more effort to notice you acknowledge your presence say hello
and things like that so
yeah
and so this dress for success thing i think is by and large i've i'm kind of convinced that by that just that one
experience and then having talked to several other people that
unless you're in a an environment where they're going to make fun of better clothes that better clothes always pay off
how shall i say it
they don't have to be the most
the absolute best
but
a little dressing a little bit above the standard i think would
pay off so i'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again
i don't know no
quite warm in the summertime not hot like i lived in the midwest for a while
and i know that you know it can be
freezing cold in the wintertime and
and hot and sticky in the summertime
we don't have that much it's a very mild climate
yes it is
right
yeah
where do you usually go
um-hum
hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
we're
we're going to go to
destin florida which is a
very nice beach area if you're not familiar with it
oh it's gorgeous we used to go quite a bit
every summer and rent a condo
there on the beach there's quite a few there's a lot of development of condominiums there along the beach front
and
so they have
they're very large condos and they have quite a few rooms
and so we we'll usually rent one for about a week or so and
and go down
oh yeah it's it just beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and a lot of
nice waves usually
enough to make it i'm sorry
there's not as many sea shells along there that's the only thing that they really don't they have some but not so much if you go further down
but you'll usually find some but not right in there i don't know why it is but
it seems not to not to have as many there but we enjoy it it's the place where we stay is we usually stay at the same place every year and
they are like i say right on the beach so it's
it's a place called jetty east j e t y e a s t
and it's called that because it's at the very end of a jetty there which is sort of the end of this little point and it's a at the very end it's the last set of condominiums there and it's
it's very nice it's not very expensive you can i think we're going to go with another couple and their kids and
they have a we have a
i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom condominium which will sleep
i don't know quite a few six or eight and
because it's got you know pull out couches and all that and i think it's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week
yeah it really is because the
you know it's got its own kitchen full size kitchen and everything and this one i think has two baths and it's the one we got is on the on the beach side so
we've got a beautiful view and balcony and just you know it's really a nice stay
in fact we stayed there on our honeymoon we i had won a trip to the bahamas but didn't get to take it on our honeymoon time so we instead went there
and loved it just as much as if we had gone to the bahamas we in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked the particular
suite that we had gotten was very nice and so we decided to stay
but it's a pretty nice place you'll need to try to go and stay there sometime but
yeah we are we're it'll take
a day and a half to get there probably
so
uh-huh
what does what does that mean alternate
oh
uh-huh
right
i see
kind of scattering the vacation out throughout the year
yeah
right
right
okay
okay
so long
bye-bye
no not really
the only thing that annoys me is when people call and they you have solicitation calls
probably thing that bothers me that's not really invading my privacy
do you feel that yours is invaded
but that doesn't work
no because they a lot of times they dial sequentially they get your name from if you enter any type of contest or anything
you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company
or you
or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or and stuff they even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe
and while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they you call me one more time i'm going to stop subscribing
and the local papers will nice just you ask them to remove your number from their list and
yeah you call up their regular during regular hours their they have a special department they'll take your numbers out of their list
but the
orlando paper yeah they refused to take you off of the list and they call every month
and when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her
if it was you know coming into the store and stuff then she would of whoever made the purchase would have sign some kind of you know document and
the signature they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature you know they'll they have to eat the charge
but if the has had their social her social security number i'd be real concerned that they
that she's not blacklist on what is it it's telecreder something
because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there she probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
we use a monthly budget my husband and i my husband works
we have different columns for different areas of our budget and
we budget out a certain amount for each month or each pay period
and so anyway what do you do
uh-huh
right um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
right
um-hum
oh my god uh-huh
right
right
um-hum
now that's a good idea
uh-huh
um-hum
you're set
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
hm
wow
yes
wow
yeah well i think that one thing that people don't do a lot of these days a lot of people just live from paycheck to paycheck and don't have enough to put away
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
right
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
hm
yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
well i wasn't brought up this way to budget that's for sure my husband was and it was really an adjustment period for me
yeah i agree i been interesting to see how gorbachev has been releasing the power to yeltsin including the button for the nuclear arsenals
works from the standpoint of being as one political entity or whether it's really just going to be kind of a loose confederation
pitch their lot in with them or
it may be interesting to see how when they start talking about border defense whether they're gonna i think most of those independent countries are going to decide that they want to defend their own borders
what russia's going to bid for is the seat on the security council but i suppose that all of the other eleven can or the ten others or however many there are can be admitted as regular members of the un
yeah could be it's gonna be
a lot of those existed as states prior to their being a soviet union so i don't know
yeah that's true i don't know what currency things are going to be done too whether each one will have to completely establish a currency based on whatever system
or whether they can rely on the ruble somehow and
and
well that's true probably for any of them
well there's only four states that have any though only the ukraine and belorussia and russia themselves and then that one middle asian the one that starts with a k konestan or something whatever that is
they're the only four and two of the four have said they would like to destroy them
it's only that fourth one that worries me a little bit but they don't have any intercontinental ballistic missiles down there either they have short range
nuclear capability and presumably not very many of them
judging by where that is
russia had ninety percent of them on russian soil so they're still going to control the by and large the large amount of those
fantasizing about can't do it right now our situation is that we're a two car family
and i have a mini van we bought a few years ago it's got a five year loan so that's still got a couple years to run
and the car i get to drive is a nissan sentra that's gonna be ten years old next month so
i think about sprucing that up in a couple years when i can
the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that wouldn't wind up putting their knees in their throat when they sat in the backseat something a little seating room
how about you
uh-huh
sure
sure
yeah i'm surprised to hear that the v-8s are coming back they've got some pretty powerful 6s
and
you know v-8s seem to be a return of the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon
sure
is traction much of an issue for you up there terms of
a few years ago a case where there was a sort of freak ice storm and we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car and
this is a rear wheel drive model so we got some monster studded snow tires after that haven't had any problem since
it's a mazda
and we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and
driveability fuel economy isn't great being a minivan but it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others and
it's got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around so we've been able to do some real creative load hauling when called upon
uh-huh
right
yeah i think that we're gonna be owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of high school anyway
and even as light as that is with the small tires it's done pretty well in winter again like you if conditions are that bad i probably don't wanna be driving anyway
so i know i'd be happy with a reasonable four door you know again we've got the same issue with getting kids into the
i'm
relatively satisfied with the benefits i have i think that our health insurance is terribly expensive
i'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money
but you know that's my major complaint i guess what about you
uh-huh
or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't
yeah i
i see
now we i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered but what i found recently is
what they've been doing is they poll somehow the area
and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code
and so recently when we had a claim
they didn't pay the eighty five percent they paid much lower and when i called they said oh well that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area and i was really surprised because
either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out
or their you know their statistics aren't very accurate
yeah i would assume that you know whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in
but it's difficult what about other benefits are there others that you're dissatisfied with
well you have vacation i mean
huh
yeah i'm not familiar with that sort of thing but
and you know the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or
i don't know i suppose sick days some places count the number of hours and some places just sort of believe you
ours is based on number of days and you know people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill
right
but otherwise
i'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here
so maybe that covers the topic then
uh-huh
uh-huh or maybe a not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls
but you know i suppose some places are more stringent about that than others
and maybe arriving late or something like that you know how they enforce the rules
uh-huh
oh i didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation
oh i see
uh-huh
and at least you know financially in the short run but i would think that they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them
right i mean sure the payroll is lower that way but i would assume that the productivity is way down also
uh-huh
that's right
no i agree
well thank you for calling bye-bye
well you're probably right up here in rochester we
uh-huh
um-hum yeah
yeah i think it's
i think it's a real shame but on the other hand you know it kind of
even with all the tragedies if you step back and look at it the fact that people want to come here must be that there's something better here than or at least they think there's something better here than there is wherever they're from
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah that's true but i think that's probably always been true throughout history of the united states i think anytime you have
you know immigrants coming in who perhaps you know don't have the ability to communicate with a
large percentage of the population that's already here i think they're bound to push the social services a little bit do you think it's worse today than it was maybe fifty years ago
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh yeah
yeah
yeah you're probably
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
yeah
that's right that's right
it's really interesting to me because as you as you pointed out at the beginning here in rochester
now we don't have it immigration we don't even have a lot of immigration but on the other hand you know it's we do have a large influx of people from say jamaica
or other parts of the caribbean that's you know and puerto rico we have a large population from there people who have come over you know maybe in the last you know ten or twenty years
but you know if you look at a place like rochester now we have a large
population of like second and third generation americans
of people who you know whose parents or grandparents came to the united states you know people from italy people from poland people from the ukraine
and i always you know i always wonder whether you know was the situation any different
back then i mean how did the people who had been in the united states for a while feel about this large amount of immigration
it's fairly well known that at one of the major companies in rochester who i won't say their name but i'm sure you've heard of them back in the thirties didn't want to hire the italian immigrants
because it was it was a discriminatory practice
and
you know it just makes me wonder you know and you know i look at what made this country great and a lot of cases it was the immigrants who came over and worked and i and sometimes i wonder you know whether you know just how different is the situation today
um-hum
um-hum
so what do you think about our involvement in the middle east
well yeah that's probably true i suspect that if any world war is come at this point in time they're going to come from there
i would think anyway i mean it just seems to me that that's the most unstable part of the world as far as i can tell
really
that'd be interesting because i actually i'm jewish and i'm actually sort of not really a zionist per se you know i'm not
but i have a
and you know in some sense the moderates may be right they may you know may be it is better if they give up just a little bit just to sort of settle things down
right then it then is it worth it at all
i mean i because the way i mean sort of the way to think about it is well
they won you know they sort of took over the
they're one of the only countries in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war which they didn't start
basically so
probably oh isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something
i just heard something about moving recently about moving
there there's some central command post in tampa i think they now want to move to somewhere in the middle east
actually there was a small country or small city i think well you know not actually in saudi arabia or anything but a little bit off to the east of it i think
and i they want to keep something over there so that they don't have to
i guess it's i guess it's so that so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something i'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it
but they want to keep some sort of central command post there
that's true
yeah that they claim that's why we're still there i mean you know why only you note it's only a small number of people have actually come back yet
but i think that's actually the scariest part because when in the way what what's happening in iraq right now
you know just in itself it being so crazy there
i have no idea what i mean what do you know just to imagine that one day they're going to turn around and someone's going to say we don't like you and just start attacking again and
it's going to be worse
i don't know
no i don't i have some friends in israel and coincidently actually my wife is syrian
yeah so i am we are sort of we are the middle east peace talks at home
no she was she's actually
i think it's for her not really relevant because she was she's second generation american actually
her parents who were born here would like to go see it though i think they would like to go to syria but they recognize that syria's not the place that one wants to visit
right about now
you know just something about the place makes it not quite enjoyable
yeah i i'd actually been there i was there a couple years ago when it wasn't as you know sort of dangerous to be out there i guess
and i do i do like it actually i would never live there i think i'm too americanized and sort of have too much you know too much invested in sort of
the easy life but i do like the food
if that if so
if that if that amounts for anything
yeah actually my house is kosher but it turns out that one of the strangest things about israel is that
no most folks don't realize that but all the food that people think of as sort of you know jewish food and so forth
and you know in general really isn't the food that is eaten in israel so you i'm sure you probably typically think of it like bagels right you know bagels and lox
which is
oh knishes no you don't you don't see a lot of that that's basically eastern european jewish food
it's very different i'm i was actually very amazed when i sort of figured this out for myself that everything i grew up with really wasn't israeli it was more jewish you know
it is very strange
that starts tomorrow night
that's what i'm making that's what i'm doing now i'm making dinner
that's great well you've really got a handle on this stuff i've noticed you
got the vocabulary down and everything
that that's actually real good yeah we actually we have the reverse situation turns out that most of my friends aren't jewish and my wife's not but i
but i sort of you know do a lot of these things so that seder's you know our first seder is tomorrow night and this is a rare exception there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which and five of them will be jewish
two years ago we had a seder we had sixteen people each night
sixteen seems the magic number for us
and i was the only jew both nights
so
so which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get these to see this
so get to see it and my view is
passover is should sort of be in my mind passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it sort of predates christ
so
oh yeah i caught the end of that
yeah every year i try and catch that
but yeah that's what always amazes me actually is that
is that you know my wife and i always sort of bring this up about her being syrian you know and my being jewish and all we look alike we act alike we sound alike well not totally alike but you know
it's amazing to think that people in the middle east sort of all hate each other
right
right that that's actually the part that i find really strange i mean i sort of understand somewhat i mean i knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the muslims for you know the israelis or whatever and i can sort of handle i can sort of handle that and the palestinians
but i sort of think about the muslims sort of running around having jihads against themselves
you know i mean and that seems really weird
right exactly
same thing
i don't i'll never understand it my view is look what'd you ever do to me
didn't hurt me you know at the moment so and i don't know there's a there's something about there's a poem somewhere i don't know if you've ever seen it or not everything i ever wanted to know i learned in kindergarten
have you ever seen this and it talks about how you know if we could just all get you know when we were young everything was great because we you know just sort of all went to class together and in the you know we all had snack time together and then we all took naps and we all held hands and hugged
you know and that's what that's what kindergarten was like and wouldn't it be nice if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and took a nap together
woke up and had snack time you know and then hugged each other as we left
