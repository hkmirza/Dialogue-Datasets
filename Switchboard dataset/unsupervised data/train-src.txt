oh
oh
we have we went out to buy an american car so we bought a chevy nova about three years ago and then we opened up the hood and it said toyota
made in japan right across the front of all the engine parts
um-hum toyota well the chevy nova is the same car as the toyota camry at that time
was the same car so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to i thought that was pretty
um-hum that's why we were so surprised to see toyota written i mean imprinted on the engine it was real interesting
but i with so many options now available you know where cars are concerned it just seems like there is
there's almost too much of a choice anymore you know that there's
so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever i think that if i were
really serious about looking for another car i would take into consideration the price naturally but
you know i would really want something that i would want for that much money for ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever
that's true
yeah
and we had better luck with our used car and i like it more it cost us less money and we got more features and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for
twice as much money
yeah
that's we bought one like that
uh-huh we bought one car that way and had we bought it real reasonably and it was in real nice condition so because apparently whatever the bank get
what kind of house do you live in
oh yeah
with a yard and fence
i'm in an apartment in plano
yeah they are if kind of depends on what you're looking for mine's just a one bedroom place that's
it's hard for me to tell because i haven't rented in probably twenty five years
and just i'm getting back into apartment life
and it's
yeah but
well they vary from place to place it's hard to tell you know how well they've been kept up how old they are and these are probably oh one of the nicest that i found and
they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place
yeah it does considering that you know you house payments are not a whole lot more than that
yeah
wow that's a lot for a townhouse
but that's what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here and these they i guess they know they're going to get it
yeah
yeah that's true you just take off your mortgage interest and that's about it
yeah
oh yeah i've owned several and built several
well and especially around north dallas or at least in plano area they basically all look alike because fox and jacobs and
isn't it i can remember i've only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from i used to live in wylie and i could see downtown dallas
and now there's this brown haze over it and it's moving north
oh yeah
yeah
yeah it does how long have you been in this house
ten years
no you really don't were you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than dallas area
how were the how were the house prices up there
yeah
wow
hum
oh yeah
well you know a lot of these people that i've talked to that are coming down from like what i call the back east especially from jc penney
are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy five thousand dollar houses down here
and they've wind up getting better houses here than they had there
so in a way i guess it works both ways you know
yeah
that's true there's not too many basements in texas
yeah gosh i remember when i was little we didn't have a i lived grew up in southern oklahoma and people across the street had a cellar and we never did
and it's just like dallas area it was tornado alley up there and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street and we'd go into the cellar and i
to this day i don't care if i go or not you know if it's going to get me it's get me
yeah
yeah
you ever thought about building a house
you ever thought about building a house
yeah that's true especially well ti is like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be here or be in one place you know
yeah do you work
do you work
so how do you handle do you got any kids
so you got he's working and you're working and you got this big house to take care of how do you manage both of those
yeah
you basically can take care of everything yourself
yeah
yeah
what about home repairs and stuff do you have to do all that yourself or
wow you too
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah sounds like you you've already got the makings for being a general contractor
yeah
if you don't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together
yeah i built three houses in my life and
oh they the building process was a lot of fun but puts a lot of strain on things
you bet
oh you bet
oh yeah
well to some of them i guess it doesn't matter you know that maybe they've got enough coming in to take care of it but
hum
um-hum
oh yeah they as far as they're concerned they've come to the promised land you know they've got it made already
oh yeah because you're combine confined by space you know i had a i came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story house and i had room for everything
in fact i had more room than i knew what to do with i don't know it's seems like room stuff always expands to fill available space but
yeah you can yeah you know you adjust you figure out
it's not as bad as i thought it was
it's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be
there seems to be a more a mature crowd in apartments at least where i am even though you know there's kids all around and there's traffic and there's people going up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still
yeah pretty much and there's never really any oh i remember in school there's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you don't run into that up here i think i think because there's so many professional people if you want to call them that
that go spend all day at work and they want to come home and they want some quiet
and they're trying to unwind
oh yeah it's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that
yeah
oh yeah
oh you bet and the thing that gets me is you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and
you're always paying for something you know
um-hum
oh you are constantly there's always something going wrong
okay
well
hm well
okay well being a female and being alone you
i don't do anything but put gasoline in my car and let someone else check the oil even but have you had any major repairs recently
oh
okay
have a transmission replaced in an eighty six automobile and i'll declare that's an expensive
oh it just well i have a very comfortable car and i
have a health problem that i need
cost or charged me almost the same amount but
it hurts it hurts real bad
no i took it to an independent out in garland
i had these people were recommended by a neighbor
and you know that's the only thing i am not a native of dallas
so that means i have to depend on
on trustworthy friends
and that's anyway it's fixed it's running and i pray that i get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it um-hum
oh i know it uh-huh
it certainly is frightening what work are you in
oh
okay
no i have just retired from the southwest medical center
yeah where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car but they're all too busy so
so i certainly hope you have a nice new year
okay
thank you all right bye-bye
okay well why don't you start because it said i was suppose to ask you what do you
yes i do
oh my gosh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
yeah
right
my mother-in-law finally they had to make a family decision there's seven children in my husband's family and fortunately four of them live in the same home town
and she has alzheimer's it was getting where she was
getting dangerous i mean letting strangers in and things like this but they were very fortunate it's a small town and
she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time but she really doesn't nobody thought she would adjust but she's adjusted beautifully
but then i am also facing my father who is very sick and my mother and father reside in colorado she's been taking care of him i don't know how much longer this can last
and at that point because he requires round the clock he can't do anything without her he doesn't know when to take his medicine
and it's really sad and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for
my brother's are not interested in helping me so i would have to move him down here that way i want to see the nursing home if i have to put him into one
you know where i can go see it i i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in colorado
and
yes and some of them are limited care too where people can do like they have apartment styles but that wouldn't work for him i think he's beyond that
where if you need help you can get it but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctor's are available if they need them and allows
yeah
yeah well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive of course i guess all nursing homes there is
but
right
yeah
right
yeah i yeah and i think a lot of people who do it now in colorado it's interesting i talked to my mother they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home
and my mother could make it on that what she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then i would send it back to her so that's probably what would happen
yeah it's unfortunate
right
yeah it's frightening and i guess i don't know how old you are i'm forty six you know we're the generation moving into this and i don't know how our kids are gonna take care of us
you know
yeah
yeah
right -eah
i also fill in my generation a squeeze between
looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise and he's still living at home and i don't know how he's ever going to get on his own the way things are
and so it's kind of you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older luckily if we could be like your grandmother
i you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay
but you see these people in their seventies yeah most aren't that's the problem
that's incredible
i kind of feel that there are more important issues to be dealt with than worrying about the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most people really just didn't see any real benefit in changing
so i guess if we were to go about making the change
you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never going to really see any change
um-hum
yeah
hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
well whenever the canadians changed we're since we're very close to the canadian border here we kind of observed things when they made their change
and they were able to convert a little more readily although most people up there still would talk in terms of fahrenheit instead of celsius
even though they try to get you to use the celsius system it went a little easier because canada is so influenced by britain
and a lot of the products and services that they were either dealing with or receiving on their end were really equipped for the metric system
who i don't think are going to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round manufacturing industries
but the average person in raleigh missouri i don't think is going to what was this celsius stuff you know i don't
hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah i
i learned metrics you know in high school and before that so i'm familiar with the system i'm still using inches and pounds and the like
well bo was playing football actually you know he plays both football and baseball and he was plays and during a tackle he ended up either damaging his hip or you know injuring his hip
and there's been arthritis and he's been out for a number of games and it just as of announced today the kansas city royals put him up on waivers made him a free agent
so they're saying now that bo knows arthritis and it could be actually a career ending injury
so they had they're having actually a special on today and they were mentioning that and even though kansas city may have dropped him some other teams may pick him up but the big thing was that nike
the athletic shoe company is still going to keep him on as one of there cross trainer sponsors
yeah he does it it's pretty amazing though how much he can get for endorsements anymore
i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever
on the same program they had michael jordan they were saying that he gets about six million dollars for playing with the chicago bulls about i think two million dollars for endorsing mcdonald's and fourteen million dollars for his endorsements with nike
and then of course he's got wheaties also
and that's in a year
that's what would you do with all that money
yeah i could make that go a lot of places
it's amazing anymore there's a also a program on this evening about the
a very sports intensive evening it seems to be on tv about the business of college athletics
uh-huh
yeah it talked about all smu and their the death penalty and how they're getting around all the regulations and rules and things of that nature
i guess anymore it's just a big business
uh-huh
i think it probably also is more as you get into the big schools
the ones that the tvs are going to cover and things anyhow when you still have the lower sides or the smaller schools they're all doing it just for the for the love of the game because they're not getting the big revenues from anyone
uh-huh
they actually mentioned a little on the fact that he's started to instigate a program where he's actually not necessary they say he's getting around the rules somewhat but it's actually sounds like a pretty good idea where he goes out and recruits other
students who don't meet the minimum academic requirements to get into the college and then qualify for a student athlete position
and he takes them and signs some contract or something with them but sends them then to junior college
so at least that's some way that they're
you know i guess the best part about it you can't just drop off all scholarships because it does i would imagine at least in it's intentions help a lot of people who couldn't afford to go to school
but that seemed like it was actually you know if there's a good way to get around a rule that sounded like it was a pretty smart way
well at least it's hopefully still helping the student
you're not going to graduate somebody who still can't read and write
that's way too much yes it has
yeah but that's quite all right i think they just want to have some kind of normal conversation
does it
really well there's been actually some pretty interesting topics that i've had i've had things from tax reform to baseball to fishing those are the three i've participated in
uh-huh
well heck you
uh-huh
wow sounds like you participated quite a bit
uh-huh do you normally receive the calls or is it pretty much split
is it well that's good
um-hum
well that's good well it's been enjoyable speaking with you
all righty good-bye
well what do you think
yeah one being total
total restriction and ten being none well i'm probably dead in the middle
because my husband's a truck driver -kay
and he travels a lot of states and i'm always thinking of new york and all of them now they get new york and california's got new york and washington should i say
got the strictest gun control law there is supposed to be
and it look what it done
it's nothing the people more people get killed in new york than anywhere from guns
so the only people the only thing that i think gun control does to me is it keeps the normal people or should i say law-abiding citizens from having guns because the criminals going to get their guns
it's not going to do any good to now if they ban like the automatic guns and all that from
period then you know then if they catch them with one then fine but just gun control ain't going to stop them from having a gun
then that you know
yeah
well the guy that broke in the store stole a bunch of guns and because the owner didn't have a burglar alarm or something and that to me that was stupid they should at least make him have
an alarm or make it a requirement on them on them gun stores
well
no
um-hum
well i don't mind waiting that's that i could care less
you know but
um-hum
hum-um and see the thing about it to me that they was talking about having gun control so people wouldn't kill anybody but
i am a true believer that if somebody wants to kill somebody okay
i don't care if they can't get a gun they'll find something else
it doesn't matter that they the only thing is the gun is the quickest way they had or they had accessible to
but if they don't have a gun they'll find something else especially if they want or they'll wait on their seven days because they're not crazy
yet i mean you know they haven't proved to nobody that they're crazy or they're in no federal no
what do you call it record or nothing so they'll get a gun then they can go kill somebody and then that'd be it
and then they still going to get it so
i don't think the gun control is going to help as far as
you know just taking everybody's gun away because japan well is it japan one of those foreign countries has gun control but all the mob people have guns
well i have a gun you know my well my son's fifteen but
my husband and me he knows he don't even touch it and it's not a hand gun see
it's a shotgun so it just sits there
because i grew up with guns i guess you know in the house my father had a gun cabinet
uh-huh
no
yeah little kids in the house and i don't like that i don't like it when they have kids little small kids
because when i have small kids over i close my door
i'll know if they go in the room because there ain't but two bedrooms so it's like right there
yeah
the you know i don't i don't like that i don't that's i don't know i just hum-um but i don't think the gun control as far as
i guess i would probably vote right in the middle if there is a way to vote
oh
hi can you hear me
hi my name's wanette miller i'm in berkeley california who am i talking
yeah
well hello carla how are you
i'm doing fine so you want to talk football eh
well i guess you better push one
yeah
how could you be from texas and not like football right
yeah so well then in that case you're probably a devout forty niners fan
joe montana
yeah well i don't know if you know this but do you know that both roger craig and
oh what is that linebacker's name
oh ronnie lotte
they're not coming back
yeah they've signed with another team
well i don't know those are two heavy duty players
you know roger craig and ronnie lotte i can't imagine you know so
oh yeah well that's all right too
yes i guess i guess that sort of dates me but i still think of the colts as baltimore
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah for sure
but i imagine speaking of football teams you guys have the what happened to dallas what whatever happened to dallas
i yeah i thought they were going to lynch those people
really
well you know how do you get rid of an institution like that and justify it i mean
that really was kind of sad i got sort of a raw deal on that
really
you said something you know
or you keech up keep up with collegiate
oh yeah oh absolutely
uh-huh
yeah well purdue's been kind of out of it for a long
i didn't know purdue i didn't even know purdue still had a football
yeah well it will be interesting to see especially you know here in the in the bay area you know this used to be the home also of the of the of the raiders and
a lot of people here still feel that the raiders are you know in are in oakland but
feagin and ronnie lotte i can't imagine a more devastating blow to a team you know the top running back and the top defensive player leaving is
gee going to be interesting to see what happens
bo well i don't know what they're going to do about bo is
is pretty much out of it
yeah i think bo is you're talking about speaking about bo jackson
well
it just doesn't sound like that with what's wrong with him that you know we're going to find out what bo's made out of
well i'm sure he wants to but i would be i'd frankly
extremely surprised
i really would that kind of you know that kind of injury is not something that
well i hope he does you know more power to him i think that'd be just absolutely wonderful so do you i guess i've talked with a lot of folks from texas it
yeah well that's great i mean it's kind of fun i've met some great folks i really have and had some great conversations
oh yeah indeed definitely
south and played football was just you know
oh yeah i played in college a little bit but certainly didn't go in the go into pro never
i went to arizona state
yeah
well it was long ago it was it
yes i got out of there undergraduate in seventy three
should have left in seventy two but
i was having too much fun
those were those were vietnam war years and you just didn't want to get out too early
you hung in there as long as you could
anyway well listen carla it's been a pleasure talking
thank you and i hope purdue does too
you hang in there
see you later
with crime as much as say new york city
by far although this year we did have fifteen murders for the year
sending the local press here into a tizzy over what the mayor was going to do about all this stuff
no that was all of last year
and the mayor kept saying well you know what can you do you know it most of the murders that have taken place up here have been drug related
it's getting a lot worse
yeah
um-hum
well we had up here a serial killer named art shawcross
who did in i think twenty one prostitutes
over i think a one and a half year one year and a half period and
the name his name went kind of national because when everyone was sitting around wondering whether mario was gonna run is he gonna run is he gonna run
well the republicans were up here scrounging around because they wanted to do instead of a willie horton on him they were gonna do an art shawcross because apparently this guy had was released on a furlough program when he was in watertown
in jail and under cuomo's watch the man was released and then he went on to kill nineteen
they have metal detectors here and all that in the county courts because
yeah you're in you're in see most of the time when you think florida the most biggest crime that i can think about that i hear about all the time is dwi down there
yeah i remember seeing that on the news i
yeah i remember hearing that too
we're lucky enough that we don't have to put up with the new york city shenanigans but
i'm where we are here i you know the biggest crimes seem to be you know theft and drug related stuff lately in the inner city section rochester
because of the poverty level but you know violent crime
in the suburb that i'm in brighton i we had one notorious crime it was this axe murder
and it's you know in the local community it's a local lore now because we all knew the husband did it but they never found enough evidence to convict the guy
i don't think i'm in the
majority of in texas i don't think i agree with no i wouldn't say that i think i would have said that a few years ago when i was younger i thought it was a
a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have capital punishment but
maybe slowly changing my opinion
i'm not
thoroughly opposed to it i still think it's
sort of true that a
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
i certainly don't advocate turning people like that loose
i'm not sure executing them
does anymore than keeping them in jail but
yeah that's a factor
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i the cost is something but it's i think it's relatively unimportant compared to
what's the most effective way of
dealing with crime and i guess
i would like i don't know the european countries certainly none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a they don't have a crime problem either no you can't they don't execute anybody in britain
i guess what worries me about capital punishment is
when i see people enthusiastic about it and
sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing and the that bothers me but it but
hum
yeah
huh
well actually i the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i don't really think it
i don't really think it's a
i would like for it to be settled once for all and get in the background while the more important issues get discussed like i said some years ago i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the
i guess i'm my view of
my i'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and
that
costs and other factors justify executing people maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that than anything else and
i've also never been a victim although i have some
i have two friends whose wives were murdered and
i can imagine that
for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
did i interrupt your reading schedule
oh
well have you what have you read good lately
well not even lately tell me
who's it by do you remember
yeah my husband is a big science fiction reader but i don't care for it as much i don't have
i think that sometimes goes hand in hand
well i'm at a stand still right now but we haven't lived in charlotte very long
and so and our furniture is stored somewhere else so i've had a lot of time i've read a lot of books
but and this is one group of books i'm wondering if you've read that i guess i started reading them two or three years ago by jean auel the first one was clan of the cave bear
oh gosh that is wonderful
and then the second book of hers was valley of the horses
and the third one was the mammoth hunters are they sounding familiar
and her last one which i think everybody waited about a year or two for to come out
plains of passage
but
i think
clan and you have to read them in order you have to read the clan first
but that has that is the most different book that my i've read in many years probably since brave new world made such an impact on me many years ago
and my husband says so too
the clan so it's if you can pick those up and sometimes they're packaged together those first three in paper back
yes i have
yes
good
but how do you read more realistic books perhaps
self-improvement or yeah how-to books
yeah
you're into what
i'm i i'm sorry i didn't
uh-huh
uh-huh
are you working or you a student
are you
well my husband is working temporary well under contract we had moved here after twenty years in oklahoma
and he in fact he started with i guess well first generation computers
and is that called mainframe
and so he's under contract now with an insurance company that has bought many agencies so
and they really needed he's an accountant also
and so they needed someone to
get things under control so he's been reading a lot about different kinds you know several agencies are on
one system some others are on other systems right now what's not red house but what's that
oh i can't not red house the system i guess is what i'm trying to
he's converting to it and then they will convert from it to another one later on
but he he's you know he he's good at and he's probably
as good at troubleshooting as anybody that you can find
but anyway let me are you are you married
do you have a girlfriend
yeah well there is a book that i want you to recommend to her
okay
and it's called and i can't tell you exactly the author i get a lot of authors if i remember title remember the title i sometimes forget the author
and it's called women of substance
and i believe that it's one of also one of the best books that i've ever read
and there is a series of them
and i it's either by belva plain i think it was probably by belva plain but if you can just tell her to get that from the library that
it's excellent
have you read silence of the lambs yet
did you
yeah i had i that's not my type of book so but it is my husband's and
yeah but one other thing i wanted to mention too someone a few years ago a dentist and his wife
were getting rid of all their paper backs that they've read in the last few years and i they were going to take them down to the
oh the y or somewhere like that
and i said well let me have them first and go through them and see which ones i want to read and they said well sure take them all just take them to the y when your finished
and as i divided them into the books that i would like and my husband picked out the ones he would like
those that he liked all had similar covers
the ones i liked had similar covers
and the what's the more those that he liked better
were black and silver and gold and red and i'm talking about paper backs you know
and i thought that was really you know we had two huge piles and all his were shiny like christmas lights
and mine were
just blue and all that
well it's been nice talking to you
and if i if i didn't do anything else i recommended a good book to another woman
okay good-bye
so
they sort of fit our requirement yeah i have a one of those pickups with the
seat with a seat in the back
and so they just fit in there when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work but right now i can right now i can throw them all in the back when we have room and
i like the way trucks are built and i don't care about comfort so i'm pretty happy
yeah
so i wouldn't hesitate to get another one i never buy new so i wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck
right and the van we're sort of we might go again on a on a van we could probably do with a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time i'm not sure
we have to we we'll have to face it in a couple of years but i guess we had a small toyota wagon
it certainly had that we didn't do much to it at all
so
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-oh
uh-huh at how
at how many miles
huh
you didn't overheat it
uh-huh
huh well that was
uh-huh
yeah
i have one colleague that commutes to work on one when it's not raining and
he's a it's
he's pretty conservative guy i don't think it's much of a sport for him i guess
i'm sure he does yeah
no
yeah -t's like
yeah
right yeah
if i only had some place that i could store the camper top i would have it off most of the time
i really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way because it put it on the ground it gets dirty
but yeah they're solid trucks are built i mean
yeah
oh i heard about that yes
yeah
that's the that's a serious truck
right this i know a contractor who just got one of those and he's pleased with it
well you know
think
public service is a worthy thing and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs such as peace corps that promote that
probably the most popular one but one that is not typically recognized as such is the boy scouts
i know that because my son is a scout now and is thinking about his eagle
and in order to get eagle you have to have merit badges in citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world
and you have to do a public service project
in which leadership is the key element
i
i think the question is posed somewhat strangely because
it's talking about a requirement for public service
right of course
military service falls under the category of a public service
and so one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft
but i agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended there are other things such as civil service
which many people are lifelong employees of but i suspect that that's not what they had in mind either more of a voluntary kind of thing or
um-hum
why
why is that
oh no it's to defend the nation against external evils
well it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military
isn't it different it is different isn't it inside than
my daughter says that too that it's freezing when they turn on the air conditioning and it's so hot when they turn on the heat
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
gosh
yeah it's probably pays for you to leave something there do you do you do that
really
yeah
yeah
you can wear socks to work there
uh-huh
and with the scrubs too you know which is just you know scrubs are like what they wear in the o r and i
they just wear reebok's it's really comfortable i haven't done it yet
but it's probably coming because we're all going into scrubs right now it depends on the area where you work
so probably i'll go ahead and break down and
yeah
oh boy
oh
yeah
yeah and i still do that and they're very expensive they are comfortable though i don't know i
really
oh i know it well in california they have these oh gosh i can't think of the name of them
they have a name they come from italy and they're cork
and they have like two straps on top like a sandal and they form to fit your feet
they're soft and after you wear them a day then they only fit your feet
and they're wearing those and i've seen a little bit of it in the stores here now
but yeah that's the new thing and it's sort of on that style you know except that it's open like a sandal
i'm not used to that anymore i came down here from new york but
yeah
really
they weather's changing all over the country
hum
yeah oh yeah
yeah
yeah i don't think anyone in texas owns
okay what type of magazines do you have
uh-huh
oh that's a
receive a lot of information on skiing through the skiing magazine
uh-huh
oh
oh and do you receive discounts and things like that do you think or
oh
oh
um-hum
so with this vacation you're taking did you receive the information from your skiing magazine
oh
oh
hm
that sounds nice
uh-huh
oh
huh that's
uh-huh
deer valley uh-huh yeah
i am currently taking decorative woodworking and country living and let's see we do have national geographic and then we have some church magazines
but i really enjoy the
decorative woodworking i'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that so the decorative woodworking has just been a great help
um-hum
uh-huh they do have mostly they have the ads on the equipment but the whole magazine is just filled with
pictures and projects that you can make yourself and then it has all of the patterns and the instructions that you would need to make a wood project and
um-hum
yes i've noticed that too but they have been nice to have around every once in a while they come in handy
hm oh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
hm
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
they do they can do that i found that they've been fun for my little girls they're five and four years old and they like to go through and
well i think that you know brand name products that we've become familiar with have in most cases you know gotten better
i think that we have a problem in this country with consumer protection laws and the lack thereof
for a lot of things there's some real junky mail order places out there that we've ordered from
in the past and ended up with not what we expected and having an absolute nightmare especially in dealing with a mail order in trying to return a product and get satisfaction
i it seems like every time i turn around i have to write one of my world famous complaint letters to try and resolve these situations with these kinds of mail order places
but you know generally speaking i think products in most cases have gotten better than they were in the in the past
yeah
with and product support for a lot of these products i remembered when i you know certain product names where you'd get the product and immediately there's a problem with it and it needs to be upgraded and
suddenly it's your responsibility to pay all of this money to have it done when it was their fault to begin with
that really irks me and i you know i'm not use to that and with technology you know i've had some answering machines here die very quickly yet other brand names you know panasonic and that little that i can drop on the floor and they still work
it you really these days because we don't everything's been deregulated we don't seem to care as much about consumer protection
if you aren't ultrawise in shopping and looking for products you're in real trouble
today and then you have these brand names that attempt to mimic the these brand names that we know
and then you're if you're not informed as a consumer you end up with absolute junk
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah
i mean we have a buick eighty five park avenue that you know once you past the three year point everything just started falling apart
oh yes
oh yeah the worst value is because if something goes wrong it's generally in the first thirty or sixty days that you own it
we
push my number okay
oh i'm a i play golf but i don't actually play golf
yeah
hack it all over the place it's sickening isn't it
yeah we've got tons up here but i don't know how do you feel about your game i guess that's a good question
yeah
yeah i like that too
i don't know i try to play but god i a couple years ago i played two three times a week and got lousy i guess that's the best i ever got was lousy
and i thought i was really improving and the big break was going to come and then i got worse again so
yeah
um-hum
that's pretty good
i'm that at worse i play next year i actually i take it kind of seriously but i've been doing so bad next year i always say this every year but next year i'm starting over from scratch
i'm going to go take lessons and everything i'm going to do it right and see if i can actually play this game or not
yeah what do you do when you're putting that's a good thing that's something i could learn actually that's when i do my worst i finally get to the green and i think i'm doing all fine and then
yeah
can you really see it though what about the speed
can you tell nah but can you tell how fast you're going to hit it
yeah but you can feel that
i don't know i have i can get it within like you know four or five feet or something but
i don't have enough field now i'm tv watching they make you die at the hole every time oh it just dies and rolls in
i don't know it's hard for me
once you're there you're all set though
we should play team golf then i'll get us there and you put it in
i oh the tv golfers they do that it takes them two to get there and two to get it in so it's fifty percent and me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in
yeah
that's good
joe pros
that's pretty good for eighteen
wow that's pretty good
i'm talking to the wrong guy your shitty golf is probably the best golf i've ever seen
if when i'm in the nineties i'm feeling good i'm usually around a hundred that's my thing around a hundred
you know i can hit a great drives and think i'm going to do all awesome on this hole but it ain't going to happen
well it's a good thing with me i slice it every single time
that's good i aim
okay
um-hum
that's very easy
i've never had that happen to me either what do you think about for instance like i was in michael's the other night and charged something and they asked for
my home phone even though you know the charge had been approved what do you think of that
does it bother you to give it
you know that they now have a i believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give
your phone number on a charge ticket
security number um-hum
oh
um-hum
privacy yes i can see you know where that was i don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given you know when i have to cash a check
i don't see any need for it when i'm charging something
yes
um-hum
um-hum
right i discovered with charge cards
i feel like that i don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list
or whether the credit report bureau sells it
but i get catalogs from people i've never even heard of and i know they have to be coming from my charge cards you know
from some list you know that knows that i have a say a charge account at neiman's or something because then i'll get
catalogs that you know are within that range that i would never order from ordinarily and
you know and if you did away with some of that
our postal service might give better service
right
um-hum
no
well you know let's face it computers can be gotten into very easily if you if you really have the
know with all if you're you know so inclined to
oh what do i want to say have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that you know and have a basic knowledge they're very easy to get into
to tap into a system uh-huh you know and which is scary i mean you know our lives are on computers
yeah
and i don't know i kind of i resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something
we are constantly it seems like i don't know why you know either wanting to clean our carpet sell us storm windows
and then i had to do some volunteer work here in tyler texas and i went to one and it just had a very good activities director everyone was cheerful
and now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore but i certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was
an absolute last resort i have a sister that is in nursing school and she's real interested in geriatrics
yeah so she she's real interested in what ann richards has been doing she's ann richards is really cracking down on the nursing homes and
okay ann richards is our governor in texas and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes and my sister's real interested in that and getting into the to that side of nursing
right
um-hum
um-hum
oh
um-hum
right
right
uh-huh
right
right
right
um-hum it sure is and some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive
because they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older
oh yeah
right my grandfather passed away several years ago i was much younger but he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life
and someone visited him everyday my grandmother did but if she couldn't someone visited him every day it was in a very small town nursing home
and people didn't get paid much there at all they didn't care about what went on
they would let a let a patient get a lot of bed sores
and the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people and
then the nurses and doctors really didn't put any forth any loving care for them
right
right
um-hum
right
right and the nurses get so worn down
right
oh sure and they feel
they feel pretty helpless
is it like a retirement center
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
how's he handling that
um-hum
oh
oh sure there wasn't anything like that you could do in florida
as far as you know crime in the cities i'm sure like in yours it's pretty bad
probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have how about you
um-hum
probably right if you look at it from that stand point
what is there anything that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area
as far as security and that sort of thing
how far out from the city i mean do you
about fifteen miles i live in a little suburb which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so
but it's pretty congested we are considered in the country but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country our major crimes in our immediate
and very few instances of you know alcohol drug reported however i'm sure they're there
but right now our neighborhood is running about eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their existence in that neighborhood
and including the out the outer perimeter type devices the sensors and things like that it's cut back
i would say that's probably their prime motivation they'll stalk your house and look at your pattern and then go from there
are the major targets guns that sort of stuff
very few you know penny ante stuff
thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many and
well the course in our particular state we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release
but for the that would be certainly be a deterrent
and not necessarily you know give in to their human rights desires you know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate
i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases course i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof
to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that
especially you know in the case of murder i know in my case i my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five and we caught the individuals got caught we
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing and you know two counts of kidnapping you know the forty five to the head you know just the mental anguish and the whole nine yards
you know the guy only got five years and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system so what
do what now
no i'm not real familiar with that
oh
well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him and they said well you know he they're he has no job he has nothing there's nothing that he has that you could go after
yeah very seldom
yeah they don't do that here course they pay them but they don't you don't you or the insurance companies never see any of that money
and you know and they're right now they're reluctant to go after them because they're you know they're repeat offenders they they've been in jail before they've been released you know several times which is another
yeah what deterrent does he really have
shot the people and return offenders have
they've actually waited for them where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood they'll rob one house then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else and try to take it in their own hands course it doesn't always work out in their favor
but nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us you can you know you can get some of us you can't get all of us
yeah
yeah that's i mean that's certainly a possibility we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death
and it helps for a while but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state
i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas you know across the border
it's a problem and i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in stiffer in their penalties would be a definite deterrent and
and giving the police agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people
um-hum
i know like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal they went to all
it's recycling
exactly i agree
well you know i think it all depends on the consumer the more we demand from the people that are producing these goods that they use recycled products the more you know innovative that they'll be
there's not a market for it right
uh-huh
so this is like within the school
do they have curbside recycling
that is nice see we don't have that here it's going that direction but it hasn't come yet at least to my area and i'm really anxious to
get that because i mean it's really inconvenient for anybody to drive you know on the other side of town and bring all lug all that stuff you know dirty
you know things and so i think that a lot more people would do it if it was you know at their door
well it really depends on the product and the place you go some places will pay you and some others won't
so it depends on you know the demand for the product that you have
but we just at work started recycling cans and what else and paper you know office paper
but we don't do you know we don't do plastics or glass and those are easily recycled products in a lot of cases
but you know you know they have the little recycling triangle
and some of those numbers in there mean that these products aren't really recyclable
so that's kind of inconvenient as well why put recyclable if its in seventy five percent of the recycling centers you can't recycle it
yeah exactly
um-hum yep well anything else
um-hum kind of like a domino's effect
no
no
um-hum no i don't think it was really corruption that caused it
or within i think people just started
you know not being as careful with the loans that they were making
whenever
you know whenever they gave them out
i think maybe they didn't check into them enough
or maybe because everyone else was doing it they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so
yeah
um-hum
and i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the savings and l made with a hundred thousand dollars
so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and i think that's kind of why they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it
no i don't think so
and plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some banks you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make
and i think the s and l's were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make
and i think if they would be more bound
to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened
um-hum
and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this
um-hum
um-hum
i don't know i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it
um-hum
you know and they just they just wrote it right off
i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back
um-hum
um-hum yeah because we're you know we're talking about some companies that have just
like even gave up on getting it back they're even trying any more
they just totally wrote it off their book
hum
um-hum yeah i think is it necessary to have the backing
it it's just it's just for you know safe purposes
you know in case something would happen
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i think it could happen yeah
um-hum
i think it'll happen again but i think it'll be a long time in the future before it does happen again
because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future
but i think later on they're gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans because i mean you're gonna have to take some risks
um-hum
train conductors on drugs i think we've had two terrible accidents here recently and also on
and it would that would tried up traffic for a long time everybody died the fire was terrible it was awful
you know
right yeah i think i think looking at athletes being drug tested
yeah and then i think
yeah i think in the long run i think it's it would be good i think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know the test hasn't come down hard on anyone i don't i don't know
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah
get rid of him
right yeah
yeah
a friend came and got me and i was there and i could smell the dope and i could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him
and nothing ever happened and from that point on i became so anti-drunk driving you know now i think people should be allowed to drink i think that's an adult responsibility whatever
yeah but as i've as soon as that happened i guess when i was eighteen years old if you'd have asked me i'd have thought it was fine but by the time i was nineteen my opinion had totally changed yeah
um-hum
right
hm traction and all that terrible stuff
right
right yeah i don't think somebody
yeah you don't you don't you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life i can't even say you know i wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life you don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life
um-hum
yeah
right
well all right i guess i'll start by mentioning that being twenty four years old i had a great-grandmother
who's still alive at this point who was just recently placed in a nursing home after the death of my great-grandfather
and she had no wish or desire to go into that kind of facility and we were very concerned about
her long-term care my great-grandfather after he was found out he was going to go into a nursing home actually gave up the ghost more or less
and passed on only about a week after that
um-hum
yeah
yeah we had up here when they got into when my grandmother came over my great-grandmother came over here she actually spent sometime with us and we had to have a nurse come in
because we simply we couldn't handle it she kind of she'd lost all bearings as to where she was and she would actually wander around we were afraid she would wander herself into the basement and fall down the stairs or
you know it was incredible because my great-grandfather had taken care of her and she demanded absolute twenty four hour care she had to be watched she had to be cleaned
everything you know it was a demeaning process for my for my great-grandfather we had never realized how much
how bad she had deteriorated over the years i mean i she would forget my name and she would forget you know how to cook or how to take care of herself but we didn't realize the extent
until after my great-grandfather had a bad stroke
yeah
yeah
yeah my great-grandfather my great-grandfather had found my great-grandfather was around during the depression so he had actually hidden a lot of money in the house over there
and of course you know the moment you go into a nursing home situation they take everything
and it was it was terrible and very demeaning he didn't wanna lose the independence and
that was the biggest problem because we didn't really catch it as early as you seem to have as far as you know planning you know of long-term
yeah
hm what kind a pine
oh he'll be delighted
did you do it with a jigsaw or do you have powered you know a
hm
well i'm i am interested in woodworking i don't have lots of tools our local schools have adult education in the evening
and i use their tools and some of their guidance i'm an artist
and i'm very handy and you know if i touch it i it turns into something usually and
well actually i'm very you know i have a master's degree and my project had to do with acrylic painting but i'm really interested in the crafts
i make stain glass i've done some silver jewelry making and i kind of once i get you know really pretty good at something i wanna try something else
yeah well no actually i get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow you didn't buy it you made it
and then i it's like well the thrill is gone i wanna do something
well actually have a master's of art and it's in art education
so i'm a licensed teacher but jobs being what they are i substitute teach and that way i have time for my kids too and i've been fortunate that i can afford to work part time i don't know how long that's gonna last
and they're cutting back so i don't go in all that often but
i've been real interested in some of those cute country kind of things
i see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars and i say oh no and i go and i make it
that's how i started jewelry making i love to cook
and i saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and
a knife and a fork and all kinds of stuff and i went and i signed up for class because then again you get you know get someone to guide you and you get the tools you don't feel like buying
and i made a necklace that i saw in a gallery for three hundred and twenty dollars
yeah then i saw a one of these country looking wood watermelons it was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it
oh yeah uh-huh
i went there we have home depot out here i don't know if you've heard of it i went and i got
two six foot inch thick boards turned into watermelon i had to cut it into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lathe and cutting that wedge out was no joke
i did it through adult ed again
so we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of
a cradle for it
well it the instructions in the book i had said use a coping saw
but there's no coping saw big enough to for a fourteen inch wide watermelon and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular i said i'm not that steady it's not gonna happen
on the radial saw by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about so
i'd say it's about an eighth you know just
dave what kind of pets do you have
one rotten cat
i heard a laugh in the background
oh you don't like cats
oh yeah
that said what does how does he treat the other people
wow
uh-huh
huh that's interesting
she a lot of people drop off abandoned pets at her house
and she used to work for a veterinarian so she would spay neuter them
give them all their shots and we saw an ad saying it was free so we went down there and picked it up and it's been an excellent dog but this is my first dog i've had
and we got it because well my wife stays here at home alone while i go to work so that's mostly why we got it to keep her company while i'm away at work
yeah right now it is it's kind of good training i mean we've been trying for kids but right now we haven't had any but
my brother has we didn't do a lot with them i never felt it like it was mine or anything you couldn't do anything
but i mean it's a bit more responsibility
but
um-hum
that's what we found ours is like a cockapoo i think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle but it's a really good dog
i don't know they seem to be i mean listen better or something is your cat a purebred
uh-huh
would you ever want a dog in the family
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
wow
they just need a lot of
well what do you feel do you feel that our government is it possible to have an honest government or do we have an honest government
um-hum
but i do think based on what i read what i've read about our history of our government i think things are getting better
americans are becoming a little more aware and are forcing our government to be on top of
integrity you know as an order
uh-huh yeah
um-hum
right
uh-huh
have i
no not yet huh-uh
uh-huh
thinking of running for president does that worry you at all
uh-huh
um-hum yeah
i don't either
um-hum
wow
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i'm kind of disappointed that the two parties have such a stronghold in the in the nation because if you belong to any other party you know any other platform i should say you're not represented
i don't i don't belong to any particular platform and i don't think i ever will but
i think that's a little bit disconcerting you know where
where we really americans don't have a voice unless they participate within one of the two systems
um-hum
um-hum
okay let's see i believe in the trial by jury i think if it was up to the judge alone that
there would be real possible for payoffs you know briberies unfairness one-sidedness you know all those kinds of things
and i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody
i really agree with the innocent until proven guilty
theory i think that's
that's a good way to do it
you know that's about all
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum really
um-hum
um-hum
right
yeah
right
yeah that's a good idea maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of
you know where they could go from there do they need a big lengthy twelve person jury or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things and
the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how
is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that
yeah that's that could be a good idea to that could work
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
huh yeah
yeah
yeah right that
right that's a good idea i in the bible it says if you have something against somebody to go to them first
and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church
so that's right off that same kind of principle
that's a that's a good idea
yeah that's true that's true too
but you know that whole biblical concept like that that's true in a lot of our
you know the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesn't work on that but it's based out of that
and so that you know that could work there
what is that called the judo-christian ethic judeo-christian ethic
yeah
right
um-hum
yeah that's
really
really yeah
yeah mine too
yeah same here what part of the country are you from
oh okay in texas okay i was just being curious
oh are you really wow okay well i'll let you go and it was nice talking to you
oh you too bye
mark i was wondering if you had any what do what do you like to do in your spare time
really have you had lessons guitar lessons
um-hum
huh well have you ever wanted to play in a band
well and bad hours too
i usually
you know i do some crafts and things but mostly out of necessity like if it's christmas time or a birthday or we bought a house not too long ago and i needed some decorations and things for the walls and so i've done some
crafts and things to hang up but i don't do it i don't think so much out of enjoyment now do you do your woodworking for enjoyment
um-hum
yeah
that's true is it one of those things that you have to have expensive equipment for
um-hum
um-hum
hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's pretty funny well i since my kids started to school they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit they have like a pirate day and a pilgrim feast and things and so i've done some
right so i've done some sewing and things but you know to meet the demands of all these costumes but and i enjoy it in a way but
uh-huh
hum
uh-huh
yeah
well and there's a lot of people that enjoy sewing
hum but i have you know done some knitting and some other crafts like that but not
you know not so much because it's all so expensive to go and collect all of the material and then the tools you need
uh-huh i like that
um-hum
and it's
yeah sounds good
yep that's right we have enjoyed that seems like we've done a lot
too well has it has it been snowing that way wherever you are
um-hum
how do you feel about gun control
right
they he had to fill out some forms but i guess california might be tougher i don't know
yeah it's a it's a hard decision to make
right
right
no i yeah i agree that it would be like people in
i'm not sure
i let's see
i guess my feelings are that we almost have a universal health care system to a great degree except that now i read where we've left out about thirty four million people
and i don't know exactly how we're gonna cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves so i have a feeling since i have
just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this then becomes an obligation of the government because it's gonna become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway
well it seems to me that i'm paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high
and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that
would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who
employ these people and pay them you know subminimum wages or whatever were asked to share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is and myself i guess
well
well who else is gonna do this then
i mean it's worked successfully in europe i've heard all these stories about i travel extensively
and spend maybe half a year in europe every year and i find that the health care programs there
are administered with at least people i talk to
with a great deal of integrity and people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree as a matter of fact if i'm injured or
have an emergency when i'm say in germany or france that i'm automatically taken care of i mean i don't even have to pay
well i know it i have a solution you see my solution even though i'm rapidly approaching the
the age when i'll qualify for medicare and medicaid i my mother and father both well my father's not living but my mother is
and they are of an advanced years and when i see the money that's poured down the down the drain on medicare and medicaid i mean the absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in and the extraordinary amounts
i know that because those people vote i mean they're the ones who get out and vote that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition i think
and we're spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people
that's right i mean it does seem like we're now i noticed just the other day in the paper that medicare will be based payments will be based not just on cost but on cost effectiveness so i
well i don't know we'll see how that goes i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment but we'll see what happens
well listen i think i've exhausted my self on at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it
okay see you next time bye
well i think aids research should be funded more than it's currently being funded i think that
people including i mean mostly the government but also you know a lot of americans i think that it's a disease of a certain population i meaning homosexuals and intravenous drug users
in fact it is very much a normal person's disease as well i think that we should fund much more
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
well you know you have you have a point about you know where there's other issues that need a lot of funding too and sure that is true
you know aids is something that has to be dealt with by every person and not just in
understanding that it's you know can affect everyone
but in acting in a you know sensible way to avoid the spread of this disease
um-hum
sure
right
um-hum
right
right
yeah good point i think more often should go into you know aids education
you know you know public service commercials schools
things like that
yeah which is ridiculous
right
right
um-hum
right i hear a lot more in local news about it
yeah
interesting
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah i guess so
um-hum
um-hum
right
what year
oh
yeah
it's true it's definitely true because
yeah well honda does too that's why i was really
uh-huh
yeah
that's true
that's true
oh i definitely agree with you there because i had
i don't know
they're a lot i don't like the new style like of the toyota van and the new chevy lumina van i don't like those styles the mpv is more of just
i i'm not sure how to explain it i mean it looks i guess kind of like the chevy aerostar or arrow
astro i guess is what it something like that but i used to really like the looks of the mpv because it looks more like a minivan rather than i think
um-hum
yeah
yeah
whoops
there's some kind of problems hello
are you still there this is something's wrong i don't know it sounds funny though doesn't it
huh
oh at least yeah
yeah
this is strange
uh-huh
oh
wow i haven't seen those
wow
oh yeah definitely if it's a limited edition usually no matter what it is if it's a limited edition it's usually worth something later on
huh
oh
really
now see i would have never figured that i would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition
and well they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they
yeah that's true
um-hum
hum
huh
right
right
the expensive ones they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand but those are pretty stripped and there's nothing there's really that one's just more for looks you know it doesn't have any really the performance that the expensive one does
you know but i've seen one of those and it's not that great i mean because they really
yeah the like i mean they have better it's not quite as nice for a little bit less
right
oh really
to help the budget the first i believe in would be to give the president a line item veto
i think that a lot of times the members of congress
when they're faced with the possibility of having to cut jobs in their district by because of shutting down a federal project or something just don't have the
the willpower on their own to
to make the tough decisions and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the president who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can
i guess be a little bit more insulated from the concerns of one of one district
yeah that's exactly right
yeah one of the there's a bill pending before congress which i'm trying to remember what it's called it's something like the pork buster bill that if approved would make it
you wouldn't be able to
put in new projects and things in a conference committee or at anytime where they weren't reviewed by the regular committee that has responsibility for that
and that's like what you were talking about where they slip things in at the last minute
and the conference committee is really the worst place for that to happen
because no one
has it doesn't go back into the regular committee for review after the conference committee it just goes back to the house and the senate for a final up or down vote on the whole thing
i agree
um-hum
and i don't know that just sort of seems to be unfortunately part of the just how the system operates now
gee is there anything specific that you think in the way of federal programs or whatever that would be eliminated to try to cut federal spending
and just eliminate all that high level bureaucracy
how do you feel about bringing home all of our troops from europe and the far east and letting germany and japan defend themselves
yeah
well we'll always have a presence there but we don't we don't need to have half a million troops overseas
that's right
um-hum
yeah another area that's that i really think ought to be cut is direct foreign aid
uh-huh
that's a nice car isn't it
um-hum
can you use it for personal too
so you buying a car to you right at this point anyway isn't a big deal
uh-huh
yeah
we just bought two years ago we just bought a plymouth voyager
and it's been great we've got a family of five three kids and that's the only way to travel as far as i'm concerned
the kids can get up and move around and you can
get them things
it's not it's a it's a minivan
and it was the best rating out of the consumer reports and things
i do i do and
yeah we've only bought two new cars i bought a nissan sentra
that and i really liked it too didn't have any problems with it
and this one has been an exceptional vehicle we've really enjoyed it especially for kids
uh-huh
yes
well actually my philosophy about i mean if i was going to buy something for me like
but they're just not practical if you have kids
you can't
well if they get older i guess you can take four or five people but when they're small you got to get up and crawl over the seat you know which doesn't work
uh-huh
yep
yeah
and chrysler's started doing some nice things with their with their warranties and things i've got a seven year seventy thousand mile warranty on the drive train
yeah and a three year thirty six thousand mile on i think it's a that's pretty well bumper to bumper
but the drive train is seven seventy and that's i think that's one of the well i kind of think that the other manufacturers are now bumping it up to meet it but chrysler was the first to do that
yeah
yep
yeah
and i'm thinking about getting a used car with my next one trying to see if i can't take some of the
depreciation off i don't know they're still danger expensive you know i'd you know only i only want to buy something like maybe twenty thousand miles on it they don't go down much you know unless they're a couple years old or something
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yes
you're kidding me
hum
yeah
huh
wood working do you do much in the way of wood working
i'm in about the same condition had access to a fair amount of my father's place before i
moved away but it's been several years ago
but i've always enjoyed what chances i had to do wood working
framing like picture framing
yeah
oh okay yeah okay well it was
yeah
yeah my
right now what i've got in the way of wood working tools is a circular saw and a square
that's it well a drill i do have a drill
yeah
i don't know the wood working projects i've been involved with lately we
converted a very large section of shelving from an a restaurant that went belly up into a small smaller set for the home it something for my text books and my computer to stand on
no
ooh
um-hum
it's smooth faced doors
these are like smooth faced doors
yeah
it would
that would make a good table top
oh the fellow with the beard that's hooked up with sears now
villa or something like
doohinkey
new yankee workshop
oh okay it's a series though
huh
yeah
oh yeah he's got a he's got the sort of thing that you know a professional shop would envy more than likely
if i had yes
yeah well actually a lot of that stuff you can still do but it just takes more time and a lot more talent when you have you got limited resources
yeah
oh yeah it's expensive stuff and
last piece of hard wood that i bought was let's see a one by ten by
one inch by ten inch by four foot piece of
of walnut
oh beautiful piece of walnut
and now for the life of me i don't know what i did with that board
i carried it around i got it all sanded out and planed out and never did get done with what ever it was i'd originally planned to do with it and i think i wound up giving it to my little brother
yeah
anyway
um-hum
yeah
yeah
i've
it's one night a week and i think it's something you'd probably really enjoy
i don't know i was thirty three and i and just started college
and i mean going into it was like oh it sounds you know like it'd be fun but and i had all kinds of little buts that never really amounted to much but
you know when i finally got into it i was so glad i did
yeah
yeah it it's i mean hobbies like that are therapeutic too
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh yeah i
yeah i understand that right now that's just the problem i have and we don't ain't been able to save any because i am putting my wife through school right now
got to
maxed out right now but
we try to put a little away every month you know and plus we've got child care which we got to put in there and everything and
we try to put a little away for his you know school education and stuff for later on
he's five
yeah
yep
that's
yeah if you yeah it's kind of expensive for her you know going to nursing school nursing school is one of the more expensive ones
u t a
and you know
the budget part kind of falls in there you know you get unexpected expenses and stuff
for that because she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that
that adds more to the gas budget
do what ma'am
no she goes they have a class there every tuesday and that's what they do and then she'll start during her senior year
going to the hospital three times a week so
yeah
um-hum
yeah i understand
that's the same problem we fall into you know
you know when we do have a little extra we try to go out and do a little something you know
be with the kids a little bit during that time and
kind of a family deal
but anyway i think that we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that
we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that you know the governments doing with our money
we're probably one of the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have the you know as far as the quality of the streets the school systems
the hospital stuff that the government gives money to the you know all the things that the government does like that i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i don't think
anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they've been messing it up for many years now so yeah
um-hum
yeah
right i think it's seven here or seven point something
oh really yeah there's we're still we still one of few that don't have the state tax taxes
yeah that's true
yeah i do i've lived in the dallas area here since i was like four so it's i don't know rural an urban area i guess whatever i don't know what i'm
yeah
no i've just lived here but
i don't know i do i can think of all the
the biblical things about it too where what did they say to i can't think of this the scripture render unto caesar's what is caesar's so
you know even
i think even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and jesus said the money in the fish's mouth or in the fish's inside the fish
and i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah
right
right
right get in yeah
oh sure
sure
right
um-hum right
yeah are
no not really i we've i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year
i have been married for just a few years so i've had to really switch around from the ez form to the just a regular right all the deductions and all that
yeah it really did i saw that too
right that's we're looking at buying a house and that's one of the main pluses we have about buying a house is
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah you there's a thing i just i've been trying to learn as much as i can about it
if you pay i know i get paid twice a month every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months
so if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you'll come out paying a
one month extra every year and it'll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note
oh yeah
um-hum
right yeah
right
right and that's going on the principle it doesn't pay any interest or usually it doesn't anyway
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right that's what we're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty we're not going to go longer than twenty
but we're taking our time we're going try to make our decision by july
so and we just started like two or three weeks ago and we're not going to just kill ourselves you know just two or three houses a week at the most
and
yeah
yeah absolutely and the credit union has nine percent interest so yeah so that's
i don't know we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now
but anyway well i can't think of a whole lot more to say
i guess before i even met her but
okay
but anyway i just yeah she went to school there at cathy walker
no yeah but she
yeah thanks a lot you y'all work at ti you do okay oh really wow that's interesting i work in the in the wafer in
oh really yeah
oh wow
yeah i'm turning in a capital request right now yeah that's funny that's where you're from a machine that puts
back grind tape on and off the wafers
yeah i'm sort of an acting process engineer but not officially but that's pretty much what i do yeah
right and do most for
oh i like him he's hard but i we i think we needed that
and he's i mean he
um-hum
yeah that's what he said here he's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before
which has made us as lot more stable but anyway well it was nice to talk to you and they're are going to interrupt us any minute now i can tell
okay yeah me too well you too bye
well stephanie what's your position on gun control
um-hum
now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles
really
and that didn't help at all
huh
um-hum i usually just i'm trying to think of i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the like three
where i don't think you should necessarily ban guns any by any means but you should definitely have the character search and they the seven day holding period and things along that nature
you know you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and you know right off the shelf
and but
uh-huh exactly
and so i think that kind of control is would be good
but the i you know i'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and just to kind of exam it a little bit and i know that any statement and its absoluteness is not necessarily true
only the guns were in the hands of the criminals but how many times i guess i have never heard of a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun
and maybe they just don't report those or i'm not sure or you know i can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they
they thwarted the robbery attempt
um-hum
um-hum
true
did you were you brought up in a family that hunted or
how about that
huh
um-hum
oh jeez
right
um-hum
right i've also always thought about the idea you know most sports
you know which are the n r a and people have their thing you know if you ban guns you're just banning the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature most of that's done with rifles and such
though there's you know probably i'm sure some sector that does it with handguns but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns
would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous you couldn't be as inconspicuous when you walked into a store stuff like that you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately
now of course you know in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want
but i guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and you know temporarily a little bit offset or off keel
i don't know if that's a large percentage of crime or not but i guess it would be some
but i think definitely like today they just introduced the what's called the brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns and i think that
shoot that's a good idea
oh sure
uh-huh
right
yeah that's crazy
yeah that's kind of kind of wild
uh-huh
that is kind of wild
well that's all very interesting
good-bye
yeah
hm yeah
you know where you get around the edge
uh-huh
uh-huh
well how do you get the edge though the straight edge oh i see
uh-huh
well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too
oh nice
yeah
uh-huh
oh that'd be nice
hm or two tone or two tone
you know
and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that but is other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
the blowers
huh
it's
yeah
it wasn't too bad i mean you save
shoot maybe a hundred and fifty
you know since it's a one story but we did like two heavy coats over it but in that way you know you're assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it
uh-huh
uh-huh
my word
um-hum
um-hum
oh my word
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my word so that was really worth it painting his own house
but i think i'll probably just do it in a roller i wanna do it about the same color and just be a little
he can still
two years old in child care right now
um-hum
yes our first and he just turned three months
university of southern mississippi
she's
yeah
probably
actually spring semester a year from now he's gonna have to be in child care five days a week
more than likely depending on how my class schedule runs because my wife will be doing her internship that semester it'll be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing
so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care by that point right now we're trying to avoid it but we just
a matter of fact just yesterday hired a girl to watch him i get out of class at
certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class
know once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home so for about twenty thirty minutes a day we got a babysitter comes in
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
that makes a big difference
yes
yeah
there's a lot of child care available but invariably there's waiting lists
and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the okay the university university's department of their home department
um-hum
yeah
yeah
it's best
yeah a cottage industry's the best way to do it really because if you over
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yes
it's amazing how much good things like sesame street will do
is
hi
okay you wanna start
that is very true however our whole economy is based on loans
but right this moment you probably have several loans out or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something
master charge
but see that our whole system is built on owing on borrowing
true but without it people wouldn't be able to own automobiles or they wouldn't be able to own a house
well now i agree and i agree with you one hundred percent i'm just taking the other side just so we'll have a discussion
here
but i still go right back to what i said when is the last time you had fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile
um-hum
uh-huh
well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget
very simple
just take all these civil service employees and take some of those holidays away from them like columbus day president's day
i mean they get all these days off now give them
what a week i think we here at ti get a total of eleven a year
and that's about three or four less than civil servants get
now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off all those holidays
well now don't forget the mail is something else again that has nothing they're not civil servant people
no they have their own budget they go by
you know i could
i can remember the days when it only cost three cents to mail a letter
well what about sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments
how do you feel about that
well in so many cases it's not a loan it's just a giveaway
no that that's true i understand that france still owes us money from world war i
and world war ii debts have never been repaid i think the us just wrote them all off
and said well we'll cancel it just like they did to the that polish debt here last week
half the countries in the world simply canceled the poland debts
to help them
uh-huh well i've got to respect your opinion you have some solid ideas
well i don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world
that's
asking for trouble people are too different
i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the us and find tremendous differences between the peoples they have their own ideas how things should be run
so therefore i don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world there's too many societies involved the language barriers
oh sure somebody said years ago well let's make it english an international
language
that's a big laugh we can't even make english a national language here in our country
we've got too many
immigrants
they don't call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddy's day
my grandfather came over from lithuania back just before the turn of the century
and as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger
he was supposed to serve some time well he did serve his time in the militia
and he came back he was a civilian again and his father said well if you
um-hum
yeah i saw that as well
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
okay
do you think i mean do you think our the investment in lives and money was worth it
i totally agree with that
well what effects do you think it's had in our country
um-hum
um-hum
and subtle you know the you know increasement of force that
um-hum
i vaguely remember we had a we had a spy ship torpedoed or something or -thing like that
oh well
you know prepare the country for war yeah
okay
bye
yeah they do random drug testing i work in the defense industry
and so they're pretty concerned about something like that although in my mind i don't
i don't like the idea of having a having like a hit squad come in
and suddenly like you know put my employment on the line over my lifestyle choices
i don't think considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody
nobody's life is at risk i don't think they should really care what i do in my spare time
i think i'm not i'm not really sure i think that they're worried that you might
if you're a drug addict you could probably compromise government secrets or something like that
but i think it's a pretty conservative approach to you know
things i think it's like a fifties approach to a to a an eighties or nineties lifestyle
and yeah well also i what i think is a problem is that there's a there's a lot of things out there that will actually let you test positive for drugs when you're not even
like not even on drugs
right
i did you see that thing on 60 minutes about the air force pilot who they there was a mistake at the lab
and oh it was on in 60 minutes there was a mistake at the lab and he tested he was a b fifty two bomber pilot
and he tested positive and he it ruined his career he
he was drummed out of the air force and he spent i think something like seven years working you know before he was able to work his way back through the courts to be
you know i guess it's called exonerated
but by then his career is was ruined because
yeah
he's he was seven years and it was just like it was a an accident
and
uh-huh
yeah
oh you know but i but i also you know you read things about like train car conductors
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
right
yeah but then again you know i also if i was a conductor i wouldn't want
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
by then i had just had a thought about like what about a what about a police officer you know
i mean that then you begin to wonder if i understand they have like random
law enforcement officers have to go through random tests just to see i guess like what side of the law they are they're on
you know
yeah i think that
so tell me about silence of the lambs is it great
right
is it really that scary
i plan on probably renting it at some point in my life
um-hum
and that doesn't really happen it's only pretend
oh
uh-huh
wow
maybe i should go see it in a theatre and plan to go out to dinner afterwards so we could sit and talk about it
oh
yeah that's one of the best films i've seen in a long time
um-hum
what
what's your heritage
oh
yeah i've got quite a bit of indian blood in me so
some of it was things that i had heard well both of i had two great grandparents that were full blood
and but they were on opposite sides
no one was blackfoot and one was cherokee
and so i knew
a lot about just
oh the kind of respect they had for the earth
that it was real it wasn't something i'd just read in books it was something i was taught
and
and so you know like the scene with the buffalo
oh i cried that was horrible
i just i mean you know it that because i know it happened over and over and over again
and i mean it's just like we're raping our land now but
you know it was i just thought that was one of the best movies i've seen in so long because it made me laugh i mean i was you know parts of it i was just almost in the aisles laughing over it and
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i think that it yeah
tried to make people realize that we can't close our mind to another culture simply because it's not ours
and it was so there was so much the indians did teach us and there was so much more they could have taught us had we only listened
yeah
well i think of the you know the gang wars and the racial wars that we have now in so many of our cities and in our high schools
that are basically the same thing acted out by a younger generation over
you know they're fighting over things that
to them are important enough to possibly die for
and yet they just don't matter
and you know i mean it comes down to that the land or the territory or the you know the bathroom or whatever is there for everyone
and it can be enjoyed by all if shared
i mean but that's what we did to the indians we said
you know we're afraid of you don't you don't look like we do you don't talk like we do so we're going to move you out
and we offered reservations
as
you know consolation prize and they were a joke
yeah
yeah they
yeah
yeah but he who has the biggest stick is still going to win
hey all that counts in monopoly is who has boardwalk and pork park place
um-hum
yeah
yeah i definitely ought to get in on a rental then because people would look at me in the theatre going what is this woman doing
really
goodness
oh that's great
i'm going to have a hard time waiting for it to come out on video now
yeah
um-hum
yeah
it's very scary
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah i do too oh yeah
oh what was it
the ones about von bulows
oh the something about
okay capital punishment oh i honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion
uh-huh
applied at all
well i just feel like
there's a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets you know
yes not
getting paroled lets say in so many years i mean if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years
there has that's right
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
that's right that's honestly right
they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways
you know
but they sure are just
because some innocent person can really it seems like really serve a rough time you know i'm not saying innocent person let's say someone wrote a hot check for instance
you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it's a rough time for them and a murderer well go to prison oh he's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
time uh-huh
yes i just i would just be i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole
you know
uh-huh
um-hum yeah you get it back yeah
yeah
but it's
i know yeah
same thing yes
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
and as far as the other states i honestly don't know what their capital punishment is you know i haven't kept up you know anything like that
uh-huh
um-hum
but yes but still it came up though didn't it i mean you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes the victim is really
seems like left out in the cold more or less doesn't it in a lot of well especially in things you pick up the paper and you read you know you think oh my goodness
uh-huh
uh-huh
or you know plead insanity
oh yes i think uh-huh
yes i
it just doesn't make sense i just
uh-huh
uh-huh well like i said i live in a small place you know
but
it really is
uh-huh
see them yep
all right this is my opinion i i'm still a student right now and i'm actually studying in elementary education i think that there are quite a few problems with the school systems today
more than anything i just believe that as students we're taught to learn what the teacher wants instead of actually gaining a further vantage point
and so it's basically we're taught to be mediocre in what we learn
uh-huh
hum-um
um-hum
yeah i think you're right i think that's really a really neat field i work right now in a special center for abused children and for some of the learning disabled
and it's incredible how they can learn quickly if you just find what's right for them
and i think like you said at least in my opinion i think they put a lot of restrictions on teachers of how they can teach them you know
um-hum
i think it's really interesting too i think along with the special children i have a friend who is gifted and in school he did terrible all his years because there was no one who ever challenged or whoever found what exactly was what he needed in terms of learning
um-hum
right
well i think you're absolutely correct
what do you think about the grading systems and how those work
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
do you think there's too much focus on grades instead of learning
um-hum
right
huh-uh
um-hum
hm
right
when you go out for a job or whatever they're gonna focus on your grades and i think again that a lot of the school problems are more society problems where they're not looking at the individuals as much as they are just the whole overall picture
and you know like you said i like the point that you brought up that you said really it needs to be individualized and i think as that happens more that the schooling will become better
um-hum
well i get the three weeklies newsweek and
time and us news i also get sports illustrated guess those are the only ones i get weekly and then once a month we get a whole slew of them we get money magazine and southern living and country living and
and my wife has a whole ton of them she subscribes to
a whole bunch of those
well i guess the good thing about these weekly magazines especially how they put things in them you know they have time to at least put things in perspective
but you know i guess the bad thing is they don't have the immediacy of you know radio or tv or a or a newspaper but they certainly can you know give you a bigger picture on things than the than the daily media can
they can be responsive too i know this summer us news was going to take a week off in august and then when the attempted coup came along they quickly came out with an issue that they weren't going to do
which shows that they're that they're certainly are responsive to changing events
well i think you're right i think trend in reading i think one reason that the times herald folded and other papers folded is the people are reading newspapers less than they used to and i guess that means they must be reading magazines and you know other written stuff less too
of course then you have the specialty magazines like magazines on baseball or golf digest or knitting or crocheting and all these things
yeah i guess if you want to find out a specific item you have nowhere else to turn if you want to find out the latest in gardening trends unless you read a gardening magazine you're not going to find this anyplace else
whereas if you want to know what happened in russia today you can turn on the radio or tv and you don't really have to read a paper or magazine to find out something
that may be it and with desktop publishing and stuff i think a lot more magazines that are that aim just smaller market will be coming out
yeah i heard i heard it too skip bayless wasn't it yeah
yeah i read three times a week he's going to fax you the sports column i don't know i don't know how that will catch on
yeah i thought that i that would be interesting to see though
well you know you don't have time
i wonder if we wouldn't be better off
you know with a little more free enterprise than having the government do some much for us
that's what my i don't know those are some of my feelings i think free enterprise does it for a better price
yeah
yeah it doesn't it doesn't seem like we really get our i don't know i don't think we get the best for the buck if that's if that's a good way to put it but
oh okay so you know it from the contract side
here in utah at the hill air force base where i mean you know that was the occupation that he had all the time i was growing up and
and we got a good living out of it but i know just from talking with him there were it was like you said there are a lot of things that go on that just make you wonder
that they don't really even get the best out of the people that are working for them so it makes me wonder where we're where we're going with that
yeah
well they yeah they provide a lot of services that we don't
you know that we don't really see or notice i guess but it just seemed like if we had you know some kind of a private enterprise system
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah i
and it it's interesting that in
in a way it's interesting to me that like in the foreign in russia and those areas where they're having their struggles right now you know they're gonna have to have a welfare system
um-hum
your monthly taxes will be as high as your monthly payment
yeah that is the
hm that is scary because that really makes you wonder what they're doing with that i
um-hum
and what do you think you get out of your taxes your property taxes
um-hum
right
yep
yep there's a lot that you can still yeah i have always done that i started once i found out that that's really
not necessary or legal then i just refuse and i say what are you gonna do
you gonna say you don't wanna sell me this product then that's fine i'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all
but really it's part of this compliance thing
the thing i don't like i know that certain states actually sell their lists like motor vehicles
that really burns me because
hey you're required you have to do that
and
nowhere does it say you asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone
you know i don't think i don't think they have the right to do that
well that's easy whenever you donate money to someone
any of these the public stations you know i think i sent in money for
once
to public tv
and i started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine i it's like
and it just started soon after i had done that once and i just said this is this is terrible
and that's also happened to me where as i've given money to my old alma mater in college
and it's one thing they don't sell the list but the thing that makes me mad is
then they start getting other people to the people do these phonathons and they call you up
and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that and they say oh we know you had contributed x amount last year can you do better this year
and you know like hold on here who how do you know that why you even telling me this
is it any of your business i mean it's one thing that i and the colleges knows that that's just our business there's no need for someone who's soliciting should know it all
just and that was very offensive too
uh-huh
right
-ay
yep
well i don't know about north carolina but
well actually north i think north carolina's gonna to do pretty good i think they'll go to the finals
i know arkansas was good i can't believe
i can't
yeah i can't believe they beat arkansas i thought arkansas would go all the way to the finals
yeah
i -n't know
yeah me too i like
oh the
magic
ac green's pretty good
um-hum
i'm not much of a nba fan
myself
oh no sure don't
uh-huh
yeah didn't know that
huh
huh
hm so how about what do you think who do you think's gonna win the final
yeah i watched the
yeah they can keep on the pressure all the whole game
pretty good
yeah
yeah
yeah
been a while since they had the straight winner
huh
huh
okay
all right you too thanks bye
tell me what books you read
i try to avoid the
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
that does cut into your reading time a lot
yeah
oh well i read for a living i'm an editor
and so i i'm at the center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences and therefore i read psychology sociology anthropology political science philosophy linguistics history
yeah and you name it i've read some of it
it really is it it's a great place to be and the it's nice to work with people who
hum
no we don't normally we don't publish things under our own imprint
we have had books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different commercial and academic publishers and university presses
so i end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through sometimes just a few chapters because that's as far as they get
but i also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about
so i'm i was just thinking when they told me the topic i should just i should read the titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that i'm in the middle of
a book called poisons of the past which is about ergotisms that fungus that grows on rye
it causes the saint anthony's fire disease where people fell into fits and
there is a theory at least that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of ergot
and a book called job cues gender cues which explains
how certain professions and vocations get flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other like nursing
started out all men and then in the nineteenth century began to have women and now it's practically all women
and that
that's right and the thing that changed that was the manual typewriter
but then it became you see just sort of a clerical task whereas when you wrote it out in long hand you were a
yes you were a confidential assistant to the person
right
and then i've got a book called fashions in science which is a sociology that explains why certain theories get to be popular in sociology and
how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isn't vatted by your peers
and then i have one novel that's called first light that's about archeology
the british novel so it's really quite interesting i haven't got too far into it yet
those are all books that are out published and bound now but they're just things that
pertain to various things i'm working on or were mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity so i got them out of the library and decided i'd read some more in them
so i read a lot of history and a few novels an occasional mystery stories just for fun
um-hum
oh yeah
oh hey that's a nifty idea
great
oh i think the boom to parents and the shoelace department was those little velcro tabs i think that's incredibly
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
what do you think is the most promising or practical book of that kind you've read recently
hum
um-hum
yeah i knew his literary agent in houston when she was just convincing him to write all this down he was teaching
yeah i saw one of those episodes on pbs from time to time out here we have four different pbs channels that we can get on the cable
and they'll have all ten of those shown back to back in the middle of the night for people can video tape them
yeah
um-hum
hm
um-hum
oh there's some absolutely wonderful illustrated children's books
yeah
um-hum
right well
i read the publisher's weekly which lists all the upcoming books forthcoming books and
there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some publisher is reprinting those the james thurber books for children
the wonderful o and the thirteen clocks that have been out of print for about oh i think about twenty years
well i had those for my kids and they really did enjoy them
oh but they were old copies then i didn't buy them when my kids were little and so they probably were out of print all of already when my kids were small but
i was really happy to see that yeah i guess it's in honor of his hundredth
well see all the family lives in one place except for
a few of us that are scattered about so they're pretty much just reunited always so it's
just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together
they do that that's true how about your family
wow you're a pro at this
oh that's good
and then where do you meet
okay
okay do you have relatives in vernon
right
oh
right
oh
right
okay so this town hall that you meet in is that like a
okay
potato salad and the
oh that's good
right
right
huh
oh that's nice
do they always have the one person in the family who knows or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best and that's what they get to cook
that's good well i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions so i learned a lot about them i haven't been to a lot but we talked a lot about the rituals she equated the family reunion with the protestant
it was the protestant version of the catholic pilgrimage it was it was an interesting theory she talked about the
that catholics all it's a home centered you know it's all family centered anyway so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all your you don't have to come home so the catholics would make a pilgrimage in older europe
but when the protestant ethic happened in america there were people who ever went out and you know went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home
for the reunion so that became their version of the pilgrimage
you know about the bread and the ritual placement do you have a certain way that everything's
placed out on the table every year is there kind of a you know salads go first and things like that
right
that's pretty fancy
sure does that's wonderful
yeah i wish we'd
right
right
oh that's incredible
right
have you have you done this repetitively or just once
see that's we've we had a problem with that
oh
right that's what was our problem we had the first reunion or the first you know major reunion was probably six or seven years ago and the second reunion people who maybe you know had
sacrifice things to come to the first one thought oh well it's not that big a thing this year and so it kind of wound down and then finally
yeah you're lucky to get you know you get the shreveport relatives there but no one else
shows up
well a large organization offers
usually a good vacation time and they offer holidays and
medical and dental programs sometimes as well as just the ability to takeoff personal leave or whatever you need
and one thing that i've found coming in handy lately is juror duty being paid for that or at least a full days pay plus whatever the local government pays you
it's nice to be able to do that and not have to concern yourself with your job as it were especially if you get on a case
so
um-hum
right that would be a
problem of course in my job i don't know who would do it while i'm gone that long we're desperately trying to find time to train someone else to do it but i feel certainly it would still be there if not burying me but it'll be there when i get back
flex times another benefit that i like that ti's been doing though officially they just started it
relatively recently we were always given the privilege with our
supervisor that was there we were really small shop and there was only one shift so we didn't interfere with anyone and
he liked the idea of having someone there early enough to handle third shift's concerns and late enough to handle second shift and so he allowed us to come in basically as we as we wanted to and as it worked out two or three of us were there about six in the morning and
and later on well eight to nine o'clock some other ones would show up and that puts people there at the five o'clock time frame and it really worked out well and then of course they came long and sanctioned it and
and actually made it a little worse in that they said they didn't want any of us starting before six thirty so
it wasn't too much of a blow but the people that we were interfacing with didn't like that too well
they have to hang around a little later to get there third shift work in but
it's nice to have flex time especially being able to take off in the middle of the day and not hurt your pay if you come back and finish your eight hours that's a real benefit
what have you found that you like in a big organization
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
do you
right
um-hum do you find that your vacation time do you manage to use it up or do you end up into the must use okay
there's a number of us in our little group that end up having to take the must used five or six of us in fact just
tend not to get around to taking it all at once and by the end of the year it kind sneaks up on us and i managed to carry forward the maximum amount there is and
and i'm still doing my wife works half of a half of one day one day a week so on thursdays
excuse me
no we don't have we do have mass vacation but in our group it doesn't apply we're so busy year round yeah
right too
take it when you want to yeah
right
right
um-hum
right
oh boy
yeah
yeah it is
we've got if i take half a day off during the summertime when the kids are out of school i can manage to be home in time to take care of the kids before the wife leaves she works
oh i starts about eleven or twelve o'clock at the dentist office and works until seven thirty or eight that's just one late night to it to clean teeth as it were and
he had a hard time finding someone that was willing to work that seldom and in those hours and she didn't mind keeping her hand in the business while the kids were growing up as it were and
she worked that day and then occasional saturdays and with the vacation time even if i takeoff the ten or twelve times a
a thursday during the summer i still don't eat up all my vacation and end up taking a full week somewhere else and then having a day or two left over on top of that so
it's kind of nice to be able to do both and i'll probably be doing that for a few years now until the kids get old enough to stay by themselves
so yeah it's nice to have these little benefits that i know wouldn't happen in a real small company several of my friends have left the metroplex is just full of little companies and they've left ti to go to a little company and
and ended up you know even though they started with some vacation time it just did they had to schedule it around when they could get away and
it just wasn't as convenient as being able to say well tomorrow i think i will you know
and then they don't have quite the job security although you know now there's a lot of people getting cut but
still but by and large the majority of people that are still there in even in the defense industry
if the job has got something you know something worth doing as far as the contract goes if there is a contract then you're probably pretty secure on that contract
and
um-hum
um-hum
right
right
well that's good
yeah it's good that you can
you're getting two things at once there
well have
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i've looked at several
courses as it were the only problem that we have is things that are that are specifically on our job
that the courses that apply to our job other than the real basics like just the math and the physics and the like
all of them are taught at colleges that are very remote in other words there like there's one in washington dc and there's one in oregon
and they're just a few in the country that even have this type of training but just keeping up on the basics i guess are things that we could continue to do but
well we have we have lots of
right
um-hum
we have lots of schools they just only one in the entire area offers a course in what's called
i have some yes some children i have three boys and they're all quite young and so we want to plan for their education we're saving right now and we're getting
bonds and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to how about yourself do you have any kids
so i imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college
very good what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to
um-hum
um-hum
just the degree itself
well that's a that's good because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work i wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you didn't have a lecture hall with about
fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention
and but you i felt that i got a pretty good undergraduate
i went to utah state university which is in logan utah
and the nice thing about it too is i knew that i wanted to get into business
and that their business college of business was accredited and well known at least there in the state of utah and around the surrounding states and so forth
and so i felt like number one you also need to see what kind of name the like you mentioned before the name the college and university can give you
and another thing that another reason why i chose that
was the finances i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it that i wouldn't get through four three years of the undergraduate work and have to leave
and
so i did a lot of talking with friends with family with counselors at high school and also read some
some books on the subject at the at the library
and it was kind of unusual because my
my two older brothers and i all went to three different universities depending upon what our choice was so
hopefully we chose the one that was best for us and i felt very comfortable and good about that so i
one thing that we did and my parents and our family is that we weren't able to afford
the kind of education that we all desired so my parents stressed that we get excellent grades and that we apply and try for scholarships
and scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents couldn't
and what these scholarship could not supply i was able to work for and save and get also my brother
he's a he's a medical doctor right now he had to you know once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans and he's working to pay those off
so i think that the
you know once you get past the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use and the student loans are a good option and
yeah yes and as you're well aware that tuition's not
um-hum
that's a good yeah good point
um-hum
you know what i've noticed at least in my field that works is to require before a person can
enter the school program that they do a number of volunteer hours in that field or in an environment that's related to that field and
that might be more motivating in relation to what you just mentioned if it were somehow of interest to them
i suppose that would really require a lot of
participation on the part of employers to require a certain number of
uh-huh
i really like the idea of young people getting a chance to
to do something of a volunteer nature maybe in another country but that that's difficult for a lot of people i guess financially to
to manage but it would certainly i think contribute to a person's responsibility and sense of maturity to recognize what other cultures and other countries
go through in terms of their day to day existence if you're working in peace corps for example you're really gonna be able to learn those things
uh-huh
yeah we really
um-hum
um-hum
yes
it's a little challenging today too to think about being in another country where there's
expecting that they have to do it then you perhaps the whoever the organization is requiring it does assume some responsibility too
um-hum
yes
um-hum
um-hum
i think it's terrific to have criminals involved in community services and i really like the idea of avoiding jail time for people who are just
paying if you wanna call it that for minor offenses having them do something in the in the community
i i'm an occupational therapist and so it's hospital work that i know this is true in occupational therapy as well as physical therapy there's so many people who are applying to the schools right now
that they require that you do x number of volunteer hours i think it's a hundred or so before you can even be accepted into the school program to become a therapist
i believe you do yeah you have to volunteer in a department that provides occupational therapy or physical therapy if that's the
the area you're pursuing i'm sure that there are other reasons for them wanting people to do that because a person may actually get into the program and not have a very good idea of what
it is to be an ot or a pt and having been a volunteer they'll certainly see people on the job and recognize well this is really what i wanna do i wanna spend three or four years getting this experience
exactly
exactly which is which is definitely the case in
okay cindy you there
okay what kind of dinner parties have you had
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
whatever you like huh yeah
um-hum
hm
oh that sounds delicious yeah
yeah you know i've made like little swedish meatballs but they're just made out of the beef you know
and with spices and things in them but never anything mixed with bisquick
um-hum hm
yeah that's my that's my parties mostly is at christmas time and thanksgiving time
you know i've i had an open house party here once when after we moved in here
you know and had macaroni salad with shrimp in it have you ever had that
get some fresh little fresh shrimp and it's in your macaroni salad that you make
the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor
which is kind of hard because you got so many people and then by time you pass everything around it seems like everything on your plate's cold
yeah you can always take your plate and just heat it up you know
but other than that i don't have too many parties you know i have like maybe just a another couple over for dinner
but other than that i don't have you know a whole bunch of people like except at christmas and i have my family
um-hum
yeah right
yeah that's easy i always like to have that too you know everybody seems to like that too
no everybody likes that
and they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down
yeah
yeah preparing it right
oh it sure does
well when i was brought up you know we didn't
all right
oh ever since they really got started
maybe a phone call a week or something like that
i guess so
i've been an engineer all my life and
that's one of the issues that i have with the company that you know salary is one benefit but i feel as an engineer that
you know i take pride in my work and getting credit for that and recognition for the work that you do and having challenging work doing challenging assignments is one of the one of the payments that you get for your time
i think our benefits package is pretty fair at the company
but you know it's sometimes quite a struggle to do work that's challenging and find challenging assignments
i feel that one of the things that happens in this country is that you know engineers become what i call clerical engineers they spend their time pushing paper and doing mundane tasks that could be assigned to other people
i'm fifty four
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yes i think so
i've been there thirty two years
yeah
well after being there for this long i get four weeks a year and i have an option to trade salary for an extra week
let me see how does it work after you get two weeks up until five years and then you get an additional day each year thereafter up until ten years
and then thereafter every other year you get an additional day so by the time you've been there twenty years you get the four weeks
hum okay
none no carryover whatsoever
right
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah
that's right
now we're allowed to accrue sick leave but
hum okay
yes we do
hum
you mean holidays
i don't know the exact count they took away some of the minor holidays a few years back and we get christmas week off
and i guess good friday or something like that in favor of having a week off at christmas i i'm not too enthusiastic about taking a vacation at christmas time because
yeah
um-hum
well i think that's the reason our plant went that way what we have a lot of government contract work and we find that in that last couple of week of the year all the government people are use it or lose it situation
yeah so all our customers are nonexistent
yeah
um-hum
oh okay
yeah
huh that's strange
huh
yeah we're sort of in that situation we do get george washington's birthday but it's still a long dry stretch from then until memorial day
i'm kind of cross with it this year we changed managers for the plan we had been with blue cross and blue shield and we got to know them pretty well and how to work with the system
but they've gone to a managed care program and we had to even though we were right in the middle of the area we had to opt out because there are no physicians in the area that are taking patients
and it's absolutely pathetic up here so far the insurance company owes us about two thousand dollars and the checks are not coming in
yeah that's the way our company works
uh-huh
yeah
yeah our in our area they all turned it down they say forget it if this patient wants to wants to go somewhere else let him go there
okay
well rome's pretty small but we hear a lot about new york city there is a lot of crime down there and i am i am afraid to go down there because
you know i mean you hear about people getting mugged you leave your car for ten minutes and it is stripped when you come back so
no i haven't only to the airport
bases are pretty safe because they check your id on your way in and
right but even so we had a at new years we had some people come in and
like attack one of the planes because they were protesting the presence over in the persian gulf
so
yeah
yep
i don't i don't know it seems to i think it is getting worse because i keep hearing things like i when i was i went home my parents live in boston but i went home and we were watching tv and
this thing came on where these a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and robbing them and it was really disgusting and my mom was like they should just be all shot right now and
i mean you
yeah they weren't i think they were early twenties they were young men
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
i wonder where
i do not know i wonder where he gets it you know you must i think tv is bad because they show all sorts of violence on
yeah they don't they don't talk to their kids and take them out and aren't there all the time so the kids are off to their own devices a lot
i think so definitely when you go to a restaurant like kids are running all over the place they
yep but
right i see that too in the air force oh yeah a lot of especially since a lot of us are engineers where i work
i'm in the air force and so
people outside the air force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do and so all the young engineers are like well i am just going you know get it for all it is worth and that you know and i am like you are the one who signed up if you did not want to do it and
yep it is i like it but
i like it so far
oh probably not but they pay for my college so
yep
it
yeah and you never know who is watching either
uh-huh
right
uh-huh this is new orleans
uh-huh
uh-huh
you can't trust anybody it's really scary
right
right
well you hear about people opening the door and getting blown away or people you know
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right
yeah i wouldn't want to go by myself
uh-huh
i think our justice system needs to be stricter i mean because everyone they do it and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like
they're booked up yeah
right i do not i do not know because i am not real up on a lot of news things but you know you just hear about that you know it is a lot of repeat crime
and you are like why are they repeating they should have been in there longer or
it seems like a lot of it that it is more like in boston there was a case of a couple of kids fifteen year olds they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone so they picked on this kid who was like new in town and they were like well no one was going to miss him anyway
you know and it like ugh that's horrible how can you even think like that
yeah
right
oh for the sneakers yeah
yep
yep
yeah it seems like a crime is turning into a pastime instead of like you know be
you have any pets
yeah
two dogs what kind
schnauzers is it a miniature or a standard schnauzer
i'm going into all this because i used to i just got done working at a pet shop actually
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
let's see what was the other dog you had
oh a sheltie
yeah
yeah shelties are nice everybody seems to be really happy with them they're good temperament
they put up with a lot
oh yeah
yeah they're bred down so much it's
they aren't the best pets
yeah
yeah i mean some people seem fairly well suited for miniature poodles and such
pit bull
oh they're actually very friendly dogs
they're really nice i have dealt with quite a few of them people customers that bring them into the shop and ask me to like
well because some people want to train them as
yeah you really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way yeah it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond
right
yeah they aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters they are very determined critters and so once you get them going it's not good to
i was i was overwhelmed
they picked up a lot of bad press lately
well yeah
well yeah it's when in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets
because they had one incident of a ferret
attacking a child in a house i mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
and you know
they should expect something like that to happen and so now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town
yeah it bit him
and
that was that was not a good thing but i think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was it was a fairly wild ferret and they hadn't
yeah i they really should've expected it and taken the precautions they didn't it's too bad it happened though
right
well i think it's marvelous they finally figured a way to get them out of there huh
well what they wanted of course was one money and two the release of all the palestinians held by the
israels
you know the jewish folks and i guess they're gonna get a lot of those released and
probably a lot i probably a lot
well i think the developments in soviet union are rather interesting
i'm not real sure how they're gonna all turn out i hope they turn out positively and not turn into chaos but
certainly sounds that way doesn't it
yep
well i think that's one of the
problems being a mister nice guy and i think that's what he was and is you know i think he tried to
but europe is
the ussr was together the peace was kept in europe relatively speaking
and there might be a big void there and i it's certainly a
fence sitting situation i hope it's not a
i hope it gets resolved properly let's put that way
with all those nuclear weapons floating around you get
get the wrong person there i think we could have major problems
i don't necessarily mean we in the us alone but the world
yeah
well of course there's a number of rednecks in texas that i'm sure would jump on his band wagon and
but i'm sure the vast majority would
think it of him as he probably is
and
well i think the south is not the nation
certainly still has many racist type people that would jump on his band wagon
and
being a springer splinter operation i'm sure it wouldn't you know it raises a lot of noise and everything but i don't think it would probably go very far in a
overall scope of things
well i think it's a i grew up in milwaukee and wisconsin and
i think you know it's definitely a different philosophy of how you look at blacks up north as you do in the south
and you know it i growing up
where i grew up in our high school you had one black that was from out of the area to start with and you know we had three thousand kids in our high school so
we weren't really you know even you know when we played football against a couple black teams and you know that part of milwaukee
so i
i don't know what you know times have changed but
i think that's one of the reasons the packers will always have problems having a
getting back to the status they were during the lombardi years and green bay being an extremely small town
of sixty thousand fifty five thousand
okay
i think maybe that we could do better with the budget if we didn't buy so much stuff overseas
well then maybe they wouldn't have to take so many taxes out and stuff like that
well
well i agree i think that's what i'm trying to say
spend less
other countries yeah
we don't ever get anything from anybody when we're having to fight to get money to help us with this war we were just in
right well it's not true though we're not anymore
we can't even take care of the people that are hungry and homeless here
i mean
but see right now we're having a hard time finding people jobs
you know it's just crazy
and more and more people without i have several friends without jobs now that in this last riff
went out looking for jobs and jobs are really hard to come by now really hard to come by
and that's scary
that's right
it's already happened to me once but i was lucky
and i got to stay in ti but you know not everybody's that lucky anymore
and they're and i don't know the welfare system is just so abused
well i know but then okay but that's here but then other countries are doing it to us
their when their people are hungry and all they're asking us for handouts so why shouldn't our own people be able to ask for a handout
i mean i think we should take care of our own things right here in our own country and then if we have anything left over to share with other countries then maybe we should consider sharing
but i just don't i think we're and then they keep raising the taxes boy i'll tell you what i barely make ends meet and they raise taxes and
wages aren't going up that much and it's hard
i mean you know especially if you're alone it's on one salary it's terribly hard to pay the bills and pay your house payment and a car payment and insurance is ridiculous
not very much
they
yep it's hard it's really hard i
well no i don't know i guess if we had the answers we'd
we could save the country but
yeah i know that
you know and then they cut their defense i'm not sure if that was such a great idea that cut us really bad i just i hated to see that
well i don't know
and their social security and maybe they're in a nursing home somewhere and they cut some of this stuff and what happens to them
so what's the answer
yes yeah
isn't it england that has it all state run or something
but
they what is it is it free to the to people or how do they work that
in the state
or the country
uh-huh
oh okay
so they are paying for it okay well the way i you know it was talked about
well then that's not the answer
yeah
what do they do
oh okay
i don't know i don't know if anything will ever happen to change things i guess it's going to have to change
and the other thing that concerns me terribly is automobile insurance now i don't know how much longer i'm going to be able to afford it at all
it's eating me alive because i might be almost fifty but i'm single
they won't take you because they say you're a risk you go out and party i said i don't even drink i mean i don't even go out but they won't take you i mean i was turned down this year
by an agent who represented i'm not sure of the companies he represented but i was told because you're single they absolutely won't take you i said that is that's prejudicial that's terrible what's going to happen if they all start doing this
but yet they're not helping us with the companies
that's right
hi this is norma smith
pardon
hi jerry
i'm in blacksburg virginia
oh no they've got volunteers apparently any all over the country
uh-huh
are you a ti employee
uh-huh
well
tv shows
yeah i guess i am
okay fine
jerry
uh-huh
we watch a lot of that we watch cnn a lot
and then i think one of my favorite shows is la law
uh-huh
we have cable here
i see
right yeah
well that's right and we never have signed up for those i just haven't been interested in what they generally have on and
no nope we our family's grown in fact we've just been retired for about a year we took early retirement and
just really enjoying ourselves
is that right
well
my husbands fifty five and i'm a couple of years well he's fifty seven i'm a couple years older than that time goes by
but he was with ibm fa thirty years
do you still have children do you have children at home
right
well our daughter in texas is working for ti on a part time basis so that's how we found out about this calling
um-hum well we watched the acc play-offs or i guess
yeah that's on
right it's on again tonight
um-hum
it's
it's seven o'clock here right
right we've just been watching the national news
i wish our time were like yours and then we could get i like to watch johnny carson and the eleven o'clock news but it makes it so late
uh-huh i think we do to
i like the i like some of the dramas
shows
and i like mysteries
but
uh-huh we like
we get the
financial news network
and we like to watch that check up on what's happening with all the stocks and
uh-huh
no i don't care for
too much
do you ever watch that
uh-huh we don't watch that much
right uh-huh
no i don't either i just don't have any interest
yeah they had a program on the other day about people that were addicted to soap operas
uh-huh
no i think it'd be an awful waste of time
well enjoyed it too jerry and
the sun was out bright but it was kind of cold
i guess it was probably in the fifties but there's a strong wind
uh-huh you had company
oh i see
uh-huh yeah that makes it hard
bye
your a one then
uh-huh i your against gun control why
that's a good that's a very good point very good point i personally
i guess i would be a five they said pick a one to ten
because i i'm i think i'm dead smack in the middle i think that
if there is going to be a ban on gun control that it should be enforced like you said and i feel like if there if there is a band
put upon us it wouldn't be a enforced just like there's suppose to be working on a drug problem suppose be working on our education problems
things like that and those aren't being enforced but at the same time i want to see people protect themselves because things like the drug
the drug war is not is not helping and i feel like i have to protect myself when i go out somewhere because there's so many people they're crazy people out there
you know and so
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah it's just it's just like the drugs i mean they're legal
but you can get them anywhere if you want it you can get it
that is a shame
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
the reason i think i'm so cloudy on the issue is because i mean it i want to protect myself but at the same time i don't want anyone to have a gun that could harm me
you know what i'm saying
and so
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
uh-huh
right but everyone weren't they weren't going around killing each other
trouble yeah
but do you think more and more people now are carrying guns and weapons
i mean just to i'm talking about the regular like
joe blow on the street
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right uh-huh
i mean you have to because i mean i don't have a gun it just scares me to have one but i feel like that very soon i'm going to have to go get one just because i would probably feel safer
right now i have a knife under the seat in my car
if i'm going anywhere at night anywhere i mean if i'm just stepping outside my door i carry something on me if i'm you know going up to my door and i don't have anything i put my keys in some kind of weapon like position in my hand you know
i'm sorry
yes i am um-hum i have a boyfriend but you know he's not always around
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes my boyfriend that got me you know put the knives here and there and you know just different things and
yeah and i have mace on my key chain i mean i have a lot of you know little things that
but i don't i don't like to have to carry them you know but you have to
yeah
uh-huh
no
that's right
that's right
uh-huh now that's just
lunacy that's
yeah
he'll find some other way whether it's a gun or a bomb or what
oh do they
really
um-hum
uh-huh
and still got a gun
uh-huh
right uh-huh
and i mean if you
if you offer a enough money to somebody they'll go get you a gun you know if your not eligible you know come to me offer me enough money i'll go get you a gun you know there's probably a lot of people like that
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
right and not probably going to help too much
uh-huh
exactly
a lot a lot of people that are in jail you know it's their first shooting or why do people you know not everybody has shot someone before
uh-huh
uh-huh baseball bats
i didn't know that
i could see knives yeah stabbings and things
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i didn't know baseball bats was like that huh
uh-huh
that's a very deadly weapon
i mean one blow at that and
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i'm sorry
very true
a lot of sense
um-hum
right
right
you sound like you're pretty strongly
yeah
right
what do you think about making some kind of application or something
you know
do you okay
uh-huh
yeah
well that's a lot of help
uh-huh
and they probably really do that
uh-huh
oh my goodness
we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution i think grand rapids was number one
we really don't have too much of a problem as far as industry you know since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here
but we do have the same problem a lot of are other areas up here in the northeast have and that is the effects of acid rain
coming basically from coal plants in ohio and illinois and indiana
inversions and then it gets hazy around here but they're really we don't have a big problem with it
i think that what most of the people here in new york state are going after right now is it's the ongoing acid rain problem especially out in the adirondack areas
where you know the lakes are becoming changing the acidity of the lakes and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants
or alkaline liking plants are not lasting anymore because the soil levels the p h is changing
as this acid rain continues to fall and i know that there's been battles over the states up here
you know governor mario going after you know governors of ohio and indiana to fix
yeah it
oh yeah i you know i was in boston once and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour even with the tee
just this it looked like billions of cars massing
and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go i mean yeah that's what's in you know los angeles is i think that's biggest problem
because when i was in los angeles for a time it's all you know from los angeles to san diego it's like all city
and there's really there's nowhere for this to be absorbed really
tree planting sometimes can handle you know stopping some of the air pollution and that and help but if you have nowhere to do anything
yeah i you know florida doesn't seem to be at least maybe miami
but i you know fort lauderdale i don't know what the big industries are down there
but you know up here we have kodak and that's the worst polluter they put
keeps the neighborhoods happy i guess
cause they clean the
the lenses for cameras and they make film here and they're the worst offender but it's you know it's under so much control you know sulphur dioxide is the big
emittant from them but that's really getting under control now
yeah
be interesting to see when as mexico develops industrially whether you know without
kinds of music are you into
yeah same here
uh-huh
uh-huh
they just played here in atlanta not too long ago
uh-huh
they played with primus
have you heard of them
yeah i didn't i didn't get to go to it then
i know some people that did and they said it was a really great show
yeah i'm kind of i'm more into the traditional like
flonies smunk and
cole don cole train maybe
i like winten mersalis a lot
yeah
he was i think he's i read in the paper i was thinking about going down to the jazz festival in new orleans it's like a i think might be the end of april
but
i think he's supposed to be playing there he played in he played in town in here in atlanta a little while ago too but
oh really
oh really god that must've been great
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that'd been weird
i'm kind of i don't know i'm into a lot of different kinds of music too i like that kind of jazz and
a lot of different kinds of rock music not really pop type music you know like
a lot of radio play like the stuff i listen to but it's not you know strictly alternative either
it's kind of
i like
let's see there's some local bands from atlanta like have you ever heard of fuller for now they're
they're real new
they've gotten in rolling stone a couple times
but they just put an album out
the red hot chili peppers
fishbone they've got some horns i like bands with horns
that rock with horns it sounds really neat
uh-huh
yeah
right
right
um-hum
yeah their drummer's unbelievable
yeah uh-huh
yeah
definitely
do you play any instruments
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's good
uh-huh
yeah i bet
i'd never played really anything throughout school
i never i don't know i never got in it i thought it would take too much time and all that then i
i
i started getting into drums i got this bongo that someone had left at our house and i sort of play on that and i got a drum set like about three months ago
and i've we've got extra room in our house and i've been driving all my roommates crazy playing on that but i really need to
get like i know this guy that i think i'm going to try to get to give me lessons and stuff because there's lots of stuff that i mean i could i'm improving but slowly and i think i could you know
learn a lot
yeah it's true
which i probably already have because i've been playing for three months but it's never too late i guess it's not too late to change yet
but
it's that's been a lot of fun and it makes me listen a lot more too to when i'm listening to bands and music and stuff
i mean i play a lot more attention
to what they're doing and
i appreciate you know a lot of what the musicians are
what are your preferences
oh i've decided there's so many places in dallas i will not make too many repeats and i thoroughly enjoy the ethnic foods
yes certainly
course i perhaps would enjoy tex-mex
and that's a good tex-mex is awfully hard to beat do you do you care for that flavor
i understand that but you don't care for the steaks
yeah
yes i found a little place over in preston center tonight it's called oh i don't have the matches now but it's a its a
cafe au france and they had the it's a small place but most delightful i had not been there before
and then i found with a neighbor oh couple a about a month ago this salvadorian
and that is on six thirty five
in a i don't think it was day's inn motel but this woman's son had been there two or three times and their food is excellent
except for their fried banana now i do not care for that
but the other things the seasonings were so
oh wait i have a just a second
that was it was very good and very reasonable
good service and the things that i look forward to i mean i want to be waited on i don't want to go cafeteria style
i'd rather have them cater to me when i'm when i'm patronizing them and
the only time that i would go against that would be the sunday brunches that so many of the places have
one that i have enjoyed and had the privilege of eating there new year's eve night was the marriott on six thirty five at coit
have you been there to eat
well they had a buffet dinner which was very
i think that in light of the seriousness of it of the fact that by what
i think they said by the year two thousand there'll be at least five is it five thousand a year or more
yeah it really is so in light of that i think that we're probably going to have to increase the funding for research i think that i don't know if they have it but it looks like to me that all the countries could go together
and have like a joint aids research program i don't know if they already have one of those where everybody could put in their input
i don't know
i don't know i don't i don't hear about research that much except in the terms of what the united states is doing
and the celebrities that you know the benefits and things that they put on for aids research i do i did hear about
africa and
how rampant it is over there
and i know in talking to i have a relative that works for state welfare in oklahoma the aids children that are coming in with it
it i mean it it's tragic it's just absolutely horrible and it's you know it's not just homosexuals it's you know heterosexuals it's you know the drug users it's
innocent people that you know go in for blood transfusions so i mean it's starting to affect everyone
i think that probably partly is it i think that it is has received so much more publicity since we have had well-known actors athletes
everything coming down with it i think that i do agree with someone when magic johnson announced
there was a -person for the gay community
that came out and said that you know it would not be receiving this much publicity if it wasn't for someone like magic johnson and it would be you know very interesting to see
that's right that's right and i think it i think it makes people more aware that it hits other than just the gay community and
but i do think that
in light of the fact that it's going to hit all of us i think what are they saying by the year two thousand i think it's one in three is supposed to have it
you know it because it is it's spreading so rapidly
oh i didn't realize that
well it is i know that i heard another conversation regarding aids the fact that you know cancer is not receiving this and yet is cancer growing at such a rapid rate
you know it
you know and i think that's what is scaring people is that it is reaching such epidemic proportions you know where
is cancer on the is it rising as rapidly
you know as for instance aids you know
i don't i don't know either you know it's just
and granted i do think that because of the publicity and because of the people you know getting it and everything
i think that people are more aware of it than you know say if you know someone just dies with cancer which is it's a tragic way
i mean you know it's tragic that it's that way
i probably use my discover card more than anything else
no i really don't use too many credit cards i'm not fond of them i don't like using them
but i've just gotten to the point where i'd rather carry that instead of cash
i think i've only ever used my credit card maybe three or four times
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh
yeah
wow
um-hum
um-hum
yeah uh-huh yeah
i don't know they do accept the discover but i know they would accept like visa master card
um-hum
oh my
um-hum
um-hum
exactly
exactly
uh-huh
yeah
yes definitely that see that if i don't have the money in my checking account i will not charge it even if i have the charge
i have to have that money before i'll charge it
i refuse well i'm a college student and i'm a finance major
i have an at&t card but i don't use it i don't even know where it is i put it away like two years ago because i thought if i don't see it i won't use it which is really good because then
and i just used my j c penney card and it's a year old and that was the first time i've ever used it
and they're getting to the point now too at the end of the year
all the money that you've charged on they'll pay you i think it's ten percent back
so you know i even got a couple dollars back
um-hum
yeah
exactly
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my gosh
uh-huh
um-hum
no huh-uh no
that yeah and being a college student i get
applications for them all the time i think once a week i have an application and the first thing i check for is if there's an annual fee if there's an annual fee i ditch it because i don't use them that often so it wouldn't even pay me to get it even if it was you know
and my discover card i have no annual fee and my mom like i started using mine and i told my mom about it
and now she buys everything with her discover card and she works it the way you do with your card she writes it down like she would a check and then you know and that way she's getting the interest on it too because then at the end of the year they give her back her interest
and i think she got back like fifty some dollars last year
so i mean she might spend three thousand but if you get thirty of it back you know that's still thirty dollars less
exactly and she you know my mom's like that too she pays it off as soon as the bill comes
um-hum
um-hum
there's so there's so much fine print that i don't understand that i won't even try it
my mac card just take it out of the bank
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
that's good
um-hum
yeah they usually i think they're usually pretty good about that
i mean they probably realized it was their mistake if they really thought that it was not their mistake i think they would probably send you something proving that you actually did have it so
yeah uh-huh i i'm starting to use my credit card more like i said i'm a college student and the past two semesters i bought my books with it
so and i run between two and three hundred dollars a semester with books
um-hum
i
i can't see that
and when they do that all they're doing is paying the interest on it they're not even paying the principal
i when i get to people like that i wish i think the company should just say we're not giving you any more until you pay this off
it's like they're addicted to using their credit card or something
um-hum
oh my god
i can't i can't do that
i have like i said i have to i have to know that i have that money before i'll spend it
so i don't
i don't mind spending my money as long as it's a necessity
and if it's something i really want but just to go out and start buying i'm not like that and that's something i got off of her and i'm
um-hum
and she can be upstairs in the bedroom and i don't know she knows what i'm talking about you know pretty soon here she comes
when i went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back
so i just try to keep that up because it seems like if i don't then my back gives me a problem again
so i try to do it every night and yeah it seems like it's
you know i can tell when i do it and when i don't do it you know so you know it's got to be good for you
but a long time ago i belonged to a gym but now i notice that this in this small city that i live in they do have a gym that just opened up here about a month ago
but it does really make you feel good and i like to bicycle too
so that gives you know lots of exercise
so
um-hum
oh my goodness
oh really uh-huh
um-hum
yeah well like i say i just do it at night you know and
do you like you try to get my stomach muscles toned up
you know because boy they seem like they really get out of shape and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape
you know so i just been doing it i try to do it every night you know like i say it just i'd rather do that than watch television anyhow
you know so well i guess that's about all and i can tell you about my exercising i wish i knew how to swim but i don't so i don't go swimming
um-hum but they do say that swimming is really good for you know for every part of your body
so i wished i wished i did know how to do that if they had a pool here in patterson i'd probably you know put my bathing suit on and go down there but they don't have a pool in this small city either
okay then bye-bye
well actually i love the car i have i have a chrysler lebaron convertible
and that's what would influence my decision to change because i like a really sporty car
uh-huh
i did test drive a corvette last year maybe the year before it was brand new white it was like a big marshmallow when you sat in the seats they adjusted to fit around you
i mean they came in and up and out and i mean they did whatever and we went for a test drive in that and i was able to open that up pretty good and that was really fun and i wanted it but i had a choice of that or my house
and i felt that i should continue to live in my house so
they are they're pretty aren't they lately they really are
really
oh no see i'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now and they go isn't that a nice van and i go hm
yeah i mean that you know there's some that are prettier than others and yeah the new type is prettier than what their they used to look like
but i sure don't think it's attractive you know it's not like driving a little sports car
yeah i don't think that happens so but i love mine so and i bought it because i drove a friend's in hawaii
and i just went home and i walked in and i picked it out
and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to and i never did i just went back and signed the papers and i knew nothing about my car when i got it nothing i didn't know how anything worked
yeah and i've had it it's almost three years actually and i've i still love it i put the top down everywhere i go i timed it when i first got it and it took twenty i mean twenty seconds and so
i figured there was nowhere i was to late to go that i didn't have twenty more seconds
so
twenty seconds yeah that's all it takes i mean it's just a button that's it you release it right at the top so you don't have to get out or anything
well i did actually last week going to the airport i just hit a downpour and i was on a highway going like eighty
so i really did i mean i was soaking wet i thought i would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
oh and wasn't it pretty last week with the bluebonnets and everything yeah
yeah a lot of people say that and it's pretty far from where i live it's about hm two or three hours maybe two hundred
well we in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to you keep track of daily finances the way back
what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer
i did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and
you know so the only thing we're you know that we do now is i keep a little spreadsheet of what i call the net worth calculation which is just the
the present value of various kinds of investments and so forth and i only update that
oh i don't know maybe once every quarter or so every three months just when the statements come in
you know just to see whether or not we're falling you know getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what
that's really about you know the extent of the kind of
financial score keeping that we're doing
hm oh dear that's terrible
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i see are you are you married are you living with a bunch of with people you're sharing expenses
oh i see uh-huh
oh dear
um-hum
um-hum
i see
uh-huh
i oh i see
oh sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah you're the first you -ow
my next door neighbor just lost his job in a you know one of these his company went broke
i mean went you know bankrupt actually it was a subsidiary of a
but you know they just they just folded it up and told him to that they took the top management and gave them jobs
with the with the corporate at the corporate front office and everybody else was sent packing
hang on one second i've got
somebody was knocking on my door here
it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present i mean it sounds terrible to say but at the present stage you probably are
even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably are might be terms of keeping score of input and output
do you have a do you have a computer at home or
uh-huh
uh-huh
i see
um-hum
yeah have you do you use a standard
a standard or i mean
okay how did you find out about this
yes uh-huh why we think there's such a low turn out
okay well i think there's a multiple reasons i think first of all a lot of people are fed up and they think they don't really their vote doesn't count
right we had city councilman here that won by like a handful of votes you know ten votes or something
and i think another reason sometimes it's inconvenient
the hours especially in a presidential election i don't know why it couldn't go on for several days or why we couldn't even phone in our vote you know you can you can
now the colleges you can register over the phone i don't see why we couldn't vote over the phone you know on the computers and all
oh you don't do that up there
i mean you don't register for college there they doing that all over the phone now down here at the big at the big schools now what city are you in
right
just a difference of five or ten hm
right yeah we could use our social security number or something there ought to be some way that they could safe guard it but
especially presidential because you know sometimes you do have to stand in line for a long time
um-hum
and i go to school right now and i i've heard kids say they don't vote
you know i think that may be part of it too they're not really informed
that's true that's very true i've heard people on talk shows say that they feel that that's a statement when they don't vote at all
right
cop out yeah i think so too
i don't know when i voted for somebody with great enthusiasm it was a long time ago oh
um-hum
no you punch it something out
um-hum
oh no i've never seen one like that
oh
oh
right well we have where you fill it in with the lead pencil and the machine counts it it's really fast too
well
well right like the scantron you know they call it that goes through the machine i half the tests i take in school now are that way
right
well i've recently dropped my subscription to the local paper well not exactly local it's a pretty big one the atlanta journal constitution because i was thoroughly and totally disgusted with the quality of the paper
was really pretty poor and i couldn't see spending half an hour a day looking through that
yeah i try and watch the news as well we get cable here and watch headline news but it's such a
i don't know there's really very little depth to it they seem to be really out to try and entertain more than
you know pass on any real information it's pretty trashy i'm not happy with it
reading ability or something or other and things like president bush's statements to the public and they were comparing him with michael dukakis back during the old
the last election nonsense and they were talking about how dukakis his statements were like in a tenth to twelfth grade reading level while bush's were down around an eighth grade level and by that
being able to convey to that much larger of an audience you know he
was supposedly that much more an effective communicator and i think that's the same problem with the news is they're trying to communicate with maybe so many people that it's just coming out really pretty poor
yeah i agree
uh-huh
yeah that's like trying to maintain a temperature in your house by running the heater and the air conditioner at the same time
yeah
yeah they are good
i'm surprised at the range and quality of things that are out there like scientific american there's such a broad spectrum of science and yet it's really in depth at the same time
yeah and national
held by the same company
yeah i agree we recently had newsweek at the house but went ahead and dropped it decided it really wasn't what we were looking for and we started subscription to u s news and world report but it hasn't started arrived yet
going to try and evaluate that you know another interesting source of news is the is e-mail the network news do you get that
yeah me too i really if i when i move when i go to my next job i'm really going to be upset if i don't have access to that
oh that's cheap and you get to call in across a modem
oh
man
excellent yeah that really seems to be a one of the cutting leading
advice for people taking for parents help their kids through college
no i just graduated from college yes
i went to clarion
uh-huh
i would want them to make that decision and i would you know i pretty much made my decision on my own and my older brother likewise
and you know we were both pretty much happy with what we did so i think i would not push them towards any one place
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah exactly
i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in and then you know find a school that's good for that
well i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home so it was far enough away that i was away but yet close enough if i ever wanted to go home i could
pardon me
yeah i lived up at school yeah
another reason was i paid for my entire education so i had to look for something that i could afford economically you know
you know and clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year
yeah that was for everything and now i did not go out a lot and i did not order out a lot and i you know i did not spend money on myself
but then again i was there for school so
and then another reason was i was not sure you know i always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute i changed my mind
and also for their business so that's what i ended up going for is for business uh-huh
no not yet i am moving shortly so i am not looking around here
maryland uh-huh
my fiancee is down there
yeah he works for the government
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
uh-huh
exactly yeah
it does have a lot of bearing on it whether you're paying for yourself or whether your parents are you know
yeah because i was paying for it myself i kind of slacked off because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted
i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me you know
they pretty much got to the point well you know you are at that age and you are going to have to decide what you want to do if you goof up it's your fault it's not ours you know
and then lets me go and i mean i did not do poorly i finished with a two five that's not that wonderful either
but you know i
i mean i worked i did not you know goof around i worked it was just harder you know it i do not know i was used to being you know on top and when i started there it was like you are mediocre so
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh wow that's really good
uh-huh
yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know
so i went and i just took business well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept you do not get into your major until like your second or third year
and i am going into my third year and i decided well i do not want to do accounting anymore right
and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know in my last year my senior year
but i would have really liked to go on secondary ed with math education but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself i was not going to put myself behind another year
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
i think if i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested and that's what i knew that's what i wanted
they know exactly what they want to do
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
it's one of my favorite even
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
a whole lot uh-huh kind of dark uh-huh
yeah okay that makes sense
well my kids' very favorite and yours may be too young for it was home alone
they well we do too but they just wanna rent that one that is their very favorite
they think that is so cute
that black and white one and i was not real impressed with it in fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what did that mean wait run that back and we couldn't run it back
yeah
well that's us too that's us too
yeah i thought that was cute too
well my husband's name is bob and he wants to see that
yeah he wanted to see that i thought the funny part in home alone was that's good for kids is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking
and i thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that the little guy's so cute and he's terribly rich by now
oh that's right
that's right
that's right
uh-huh awakening is supposed to be wonderful
yeah awakening is supposed to be wonderful my mom saw that and she said that was an excellent movie
yes
i think that's supposed to be good and i we have some doctors at church who said that doctor was just wonderful um-hum
uh-huh
oh dear
uh-huh
well on back to your movie you saw that ten thousand 101 dalmatians did you all ever think about purchasing that one when it comes out
um-hum
uh-huh
well i understand that too i understand that too now they had
um-hum they had home alone offered for like i think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars and i thought well now that's close enough to being several you know you could rent it more than more than four times and watch that
well i understand i understand
oh yeah of course
uh-huh
yeah
and even the ones that we rent at home the trouble with some of them i know we rented adventures in babysitting thinking that would be so cute and it's a precious movie but the language in it is just for no reason
has to stick in
uh-huh
well you watch it differently when your kids are in the room you know
and i was just sitting there going oh my goodness and i'm going to have to stop and explain and they go i know mommy i know
uh-huh yeah it's real different because you see things from a different angle
we rented this summer before we went on vacation we rented chevy chase and that family vacation
you do in your home
i do not have one in my home i use one all day at work but i don't have one at home
do you find you use it a lot
um-hum
um-hum what kind do you have
um-hum
um-hum well that sounds interesting
i
i have a ps 1 ibm type
and i use it all day at work and i put all my personal stuff on it at work
so i really don't haven't had a need for one at home but probably if i didn't have access to one all the time at work i'd want one at home
um-hum
yeah what is that tracing tracking the flights and things
uh-huh
they tell us when we're through
they come in and tell us have you just started doing this
oh really they'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that
i work at texas instruments
yes
i sure do
well no i'm doing this at home i'm already home for the day
but i use my pc there mostly for creating legal documents we use wordperfect lotus
yeah it's really i love lotus i think that's about my favorite
um-hum
it really is and i know there's still a hundred things i don't know how to do on it
but you know you learn something every time you use it
um-hum
you can did they give you a number to call
you can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you but you can only make one call a day
yeah if you've talked to someone like you're talking to me now and i place the call this counts as your call
so you cannot make a call now until tomorrow
no we both do
didn't they ask you for your id number when you answered okay so you both do from what i understand
it's for research
it's a research type project on voice activated electronics you know to it's well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up
um-hum they're doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand on this now i don't know
i don't know everything about it but they try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this and that way they can check voice patterns
um-hum and get the computer where it recognizes voices
well i probably do since i've
well i've been i was born and raised in texas have lived here forever so i probably do
i'm in richardson it's right outside of dallas
uh-huh well richardson's right between dallas and plano
you probably did
um-hum well what are you doing way in washington
um-hum well that's interesting
uh-huh so i imagine they use personal computers
do they do their correspondence on it
uh-huh
um-hum
good morning do you have a personal computer
um-hum
um-hum
i have one a wang or sorry a compaq portable that my son picked up at one point
without documentation so it was very cheap it's a two eighty six
so it has no hard drive
so that's limiting i tend to use it to log into the mainframe at work
and then i have a mac that i use for graphics and
i don't there's something about the a lot of things about the mac i don't like i don't like the size of the screen i have an old plus i don't like the keyboard but it's extremely easy to use
and it's very good for graphics and actually i mean it's to the point where programs are readily available and inexpensive so i did my income tax on it
i have it's not really a budget package but a financial tracking package you know for my checkbook and stuff like that
and i found my son is second year college student and he in high school had no interest in the computer at all
no i mean he sees it as a tool much as i do
and he no he's in international studies
um-hum
right
but i think that is it is very frustrating because you know you're sure you did x
um-hum
basically you're using it as a word processor you mean
um-hum
right
well it's been very interesting
okay
yeah
when i was in college i enjoyed teaching because i did some teaching part-time and i really enjoyed that but i wouldn't wanna go teach high school or junior high it just you know too many problems
yeah they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week i'm sure because they got to grade papers and get class stuff ready and you know and they're being paid probably half what most people being paid
hey we're paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for what you know
yeah
yeah it's i do you have little kids or what
yeah he's gonna be going to kindergarten so you know we're thinking about that gonna be like are they gonna be taught nothing are they gonna be taught something we're gonna we're gonna be involved in our child's education we're gonna be teaching him what we can at home of course
because i guess we don't trust the school systems which is really sad
and we're gonna try to teach him good values because
you know when they get to upper level school and they start teaching well hey if you can play football or basketball that's what's important not if you can read or write or do or understand some science you know i mean give me a break that's bogus
yeah
and dallas school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling i couldn't believe that
yes
yeah we talked you talked about before about the school funding i think there's only gonna be one solution to school funding which i don't think will be necessarily
the best way but i think what's gonna have to happen is there's gonna have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids that's the only way they're gonna fund it because they start raising taxes for property and people are gonna throw a fit
oh yeah
yeah and the only thing they would think of would be tuition
you know if it works at colleges it'll work down below and you know that's gonna that's gonna affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do
but it'll be hard for those that people have in school because they have to pay out even more
oh yeah
that's right
and the problems with kids in school carrying guns and knives and everything i mean good grief what's with
i can't believe that i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened you never heard about that
no and now you know what we have now you know got kids that rusty because he like you know a magnum gun in school like good grief
i mean i i'd be afraid to be in school i mean teaching or even a being a student and think what's it gonna be like for my youngest and my oldest son when he goes to school
what's gonna happen i mean i i'm afraid for him to go but on the other hand you can't hold them back
yeah a lot tougher from it was when i was going to school and that was when i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy nine so that was what twelve years ago i guess
so you know it's a lot different now and what's it gonna be like in another twelve years when my oldest son's in high school
i'm afraid to i'm afraid to even think about it
that's all you can do you got to you got to be your child's best friend i guess even when they're a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish still you got to be their best friend because when they got problems who they gonna go to their friends that are dealing drugs or there parents
you know and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they're gonna be in even worse shape
and the schools don't really encourage
to stay away from that you know the schools are there teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera they don't teach them good values like drugs are bad i don't maybe i'm wrong because i haven't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time but it just is amazing you know need to teach them good values
of course if i say this is a good value someone else is gonna stand up and say oh no and the aclu's gonna get after them and have a lawsuit which is gonna take twenty years to resolve you know
yeah
that's all you can do
that's right well i got to be going so
nice talking to you jay hm have a good life
well you got a topic
yeah i think that's the obvious one in't it
yeah well it it's truly amazing to see how rapidly the soviet union fell apart
and it makes me wonder i'm not saying that i'm certainly not a hawk necessarily
but it makes me wonder i've thought about this if the idea of the arms race while granted it has practically bankrupted this country
perhaps it did bankrupt russia and was you know as a as a way of making a political change was certainly preferable to a war
right
yeah with the right kind the japanese for example
yeah
i don't know what we've seen so many changes just in the past five years it makes me think it reminds me of that book future shock
where the future is coming at us at such an accelerated pace day after day
that only the most adaptable are gonna be able to survive and keep from just being overrun by the changes
oh no
it really is
that it can be ah stable number one you've got you know you see on the news
the stories and the and the sights of these the soviet people these russian people that are standing in line
oh are they are they are they have they got some
but they're on the black market
yeah
yeah
hm
yeah
what it is could actually manage i mean it would it's kind of like damage control and maybe putting out the biggest fires but i don't think that it's really a manageable of set of circumstances
is this one of your favorite topics
yeah
yeah
they have a they have a way of influencing your life
what type what type of fishing did you enjoy
um-hum
oh is that right
oh
yeah do you do you like cartoons
cartoons yes
one of the my favorite cartoons is a picture of a fellow in a
pouring a downpour
raining oh now the boat is half full of water
um-hum
oh
yeah have you ever done any the ocean fishing
no
oh i
that's a nice sport too i think beautiful sights and it
now the only offshore fishing i've done is from the bahamas and caught a nice big barracuda
yeah interesting time i've been in the great lakes too and caught some salmon there
but i really enjoy farm pond fishing probably as much as anything
oh you can get out and it a fairly large pond with a lot of stumps and everything good black bass fishing
and i enjoy walking around the edge and
trying to select a spot i've even done some tube fishing are you familiar with that
that's an inner tube with
a special seat in it
and you wear waders and you have little fins that you kick around so you move manipulate yourself anywhere you want in a pond
you know the water below helps keep you cool
you may be baked in the sun in the upper half of your body but
it's a nice relaxing way and
gentle undulations of the water you know is it is nice i think
but fishing is a good relaxing sport if you if you don't have patience i don't know if you would enjoy fishing because you
yeah
no and i think that's part of the lure is just to be relaxed and with the world and no pressure not worrying about whether you catch anything or not
do your children fish
um-hum
no
trout fishing yeah that's fun too
it it's a challenge to learn to use the different equipment a fly rod entirely different technique
and i'm always amazed that you can catch a large trout on a hook that small
yeah
the
oh yeah
well you know in virginia well they do eat the rock bass though
yeah i think if they if they cut around that red streak in it then you're in good shape um-hum
well that's a hybrid right it's a salt water that migrated into the fresh
yeah
and that it was a big thing they call stripers in oklahoma
and rock fish i know in virginia
and probably up there too then
have you ever done any surf casting
that's fun
um-hum i could stand all day on the surf and you just have a lot of weight on the end of it and you're fighting the undertow so there's some action going on whether it's the fish or not all the time
and that's a relaxing time too
no uh-huh no the secret is to cast just over the break of the wave and then the undertow keeps the line moving outward in you know it stays there for the
flounder or some of the other special fish too
it's good exercise too
yeah
what
oh yeah
um-hum
well
yeah i hope that the future generations have places they can go
it is it is and with all the pollution that we do have
yep
right
but sally it's been nice talking to you and i hope you get to go fishing soon
okay so you said that you live in coppell
so what is your house like
oh well that's neat
uh-huh is it one that you're renting or buying oh
yeah well that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex you can still buy that's good do you have any children
yeah we moved from an apartment that was really small and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old
well they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room you know but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet
but it sure is nice to have it
when the kids come over to play they all go out there to play with the barbies and that kind of stuff so
she's three and a half yeah
yeah is coppell a nice area to live
oh i bet that's pretty
uh-huh
oh well that's neat i like cows too
yeah well our house was our house is very old also it's like thirty seven years old yeah and it was redone before we moved in which i'm
thankful for that but the it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in you know everything is like
the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has
and she really likes her school so and we're so close to shopping and just
yeah what how about in coppell i've always imagined it kind of out away from everything
oh really
oh well that's nice
oh wow
oh
yeah but it does sound like it's definitely growing
yeah
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
where do you -et your current events
uh-huh do you watch any television
oh
uh-huh huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i used to read the whole paper every day
and when you when i did that i really knew stuff you know i mean if you read the whole paper every day you walk into work and you're like you want to talk to people about
but now i have a child and i read the comics every day
and i sort of glance at the front page i also used to listen to public radio
tried to listen to that every evening for the news and every morning and when i when i was doing that and reading the paper i really i really felt informed especially having the two different viewpoints slightly different anyway
now i listen to the radio
maybe five minutes in the morning and i don't get to listen evening some i'm pretty uninformed but those were my two big ones the newspaper and the radio
public radio there's a show called morning edition that lasts an hour and a half and
they repeat the main headlines every half-hour so i would listen to two segments of that and you know really know stuff and now that i'm just walking and riding the bus
i miss that
the well during the during the gulf war we turned on the tv a couple times did you watch any more during that
yeah
the whole iraq thing
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah you probably learned a lot from them yeah
yeah there's so much to know it is amazing
well one thing that was interesting during that whole thing was i would listen to the radio quite a bit and you know i started bringing a radio to work and i would listen a little bit at work and listen on the way home and on the way the way there and
i really felt like i was keeping up pretty well and then i would watch cnn for you know fifteen minutes or a half hour and see a bunch of pictures and realize i hadn't really learned anything
you know they sort of show planes taking off and
like i got more visual information but less
real information in a way
uh-huh
yeah and it's almost as though
that was stuff was more available to tv so they used it
you know they have to show something and that's all they could show on tv they could i mean on the radio they would bring in all sorts of you know experts from god knows where and interview them and talk to them about it and speculate
which is kind of interesting so i just found that they the information per hour was much higher on the radio although the tv was a little more compelling
it's an interesting question about
you know the bandwidth of the
um-hum
well i tell you i'm for some really strong gun control measures but i mean that opens a lot of questions that i don't have any answers for
it's like i'd like to see a lot of controls on it and because i would like i think
the you know with a goal and a purpose in mind of seeing violence decrease in our society but how to get from here to there i'm not sure
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah
you know in other words a family that has a history say of physical abuse or physical violence but isn't the kind of family that's involved in criminal activities if there were gun controls and that there just were not guns accessible to that type of family
yeah
um-hum
do you
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh i know well that's the thing i'm not really sure if i want to
learn how to use one i'm not sure i could use one i i've thought a lot about this there something that came up that made me think a lot about it and i i'm not sure somebody was saying that you'd have to
you know be able to pull the trigger in the end and i guess i always thought if it was threatening my personal safety or especially like my kids you know
you have uh-huh
oh my goodness
you're kidding
i can imagine
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum yeah
uh-huh no
yeah but i but i what i started to say is i've come to the point now where i'm thinking no i really want to take a self defense course and i want to take control over
you know my own defense and my own safety i think i'm i need to take more responsibility for that than i do right now i think i just
i allow myself to think well it will never happen to me or it won't happen to you know i'm not going to have to deal with that and i just i don't think that's it will i'm sure yeah
yeah
yeah
oh boy
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
wow
wow
right
right
holy smoke that's wild i was again i was talking with somebody just last week and about crime in general i guess it's been on the news a lot lately and i must be in the back of everybody's mind but i was saying
if people around here think if they just get a better security system and a higher fence that you know they're going to take care of themselves and i said there's it's going to come to a point it
where that you can't get a fence that's high enough and a security system that's good enough
yeah because
uh-huh
that's something wow
yeah well i can see how that might be now i mean you don't have to answer this or not if you don't want to because i know it's a personal thing but with the crime that your family was involved in was there were there guns involved in that
there were gosh
that is really
well they don't have to use them in that case i mean they just have to have them
they weren't yeah um-hum
um-hum
really
wow is he just crazy
wow
he has killed people and he's and he's out one person yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah if he could
yeah
gosh
um-hum
there's no prison space
right you got to do one or the other
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
gosh
um-hum
yeah i because we can't
yeah
have a chance
did you did you hear about that prison reform that's going up in washington state or oregon or someplace up there where they're taking criminals who are repeat offenders and i mean really repeat offenders
that have raped several times or child molesters that have molested several children over and over again
and they have put them in i don't even think they call it a prison but that's some kind of special it's a separate building
in a separate location and they are just in there indefinitely they don't have any time when they are going to be released
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah i understand that
no
that's right
that's right
no i can i can understand and respect that i have you know my own three kids and i
you know i remembered that was years ago and i remember seeing that and i really could understand where that was coming from
yeah
yep i i've heard that
yeah
and using it yeah and terrible accidents do happen when there's kids around
you know they'll get it under control and i just don't feel that way
i don't feel that's true anymore they're not going to be able to handle it
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
wow that would be hard to understand
oh yeah but still
yeah you can't yeah
well the main two recycling efforts i see in this neighborhood are at work somebody got the idea of collecting all the phone books together and it's probably several tons of them
and white paper computer paper and stuff like that and the other one would be the local grocery stores have got
newspaper bins i just recently noticed a magazine bin which is really nice and now i've got a place to dump all these things but a really prominent sign is that until recently they accepted those plastic milk jugs
and they're probably the main you know source of those things in the first place but they've quit taking those now
which is a little disturbing
i don't know i was under the impression that they were converting or that the two liter plastic bottles could be chipped down and used for a lot of things like carpet industry's pretty big in the northern part of the state here
and i've heard that some of the companies make their carpets completely from that stuff but i don't know if there's any use for those strange opaque milk carton type plastic jugs or not
yeah they seem to be a pretty nasty thing whatever that is
oh very good
yeah
yeah
hm
yeah that's kind of reasonable
yeah
yep
i understand
never heard of that one before
that's an interesting one never heard of styrofoam recycling before
yeah
and those packing peanuts are hard to avoid in a business too
yeah
yeah they'll last forever
hm
do they use a lot of recycled goods for their raw material
okay what do you like to cook
um-hum
that'd be good for a dinner party that you know to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things coming out at once is that what you usually cook when you have a party
uh-huh
really
that sounds good
and i catered to their diet is the only thing though so it wasn't something i really wanted to make i really wanted to make red beans and rice and with anduille
you know sausage because i'm from new orleans originally and i was gonna make that red beans and rice with the those cajun sausage and french bread with garlic butter and stuff
just brownies or french doughnuts would have been good but it's real hard to make them they don't really come out like they do in new orleans up here i don't know why
i don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe i have but
that's what i that's what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that but
kind of like the italians it's really good but instead i catered to their diet so i made baked chicken in the crock pot and
it was good and everything it had all the vegetables in it but it seemed kind of boring compared
right
because i guess i guess i feel like if they're on a diet like that i'm gonna you know honor that
but if it's just another couple came over couple weeks later and i made what did i make that night i made a roast and i made
oh i can't believe this my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday
i can't believe that anyway but when ricky and carrie came over
we made a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit and normally i don't eat we don't eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it but
um-hum
but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies
but anyway so i guess that's about what i do when i entertain
so do you have anything else you want to say about it or
okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye
yeah but
uh-huh
oh is that right was it a large or a small company
uh-huh
uh-huh
is that right
well sure i there's that part of it i think and
and i think most defense contractors also have other divisions of the company
that can also be affected by that and i think what they have to do in the interest of fairness or to keep from getting sued or something is test everybody in the company at least on a random basis in other words no matter whether you work in defense or
consumer products or whatever you'd have an equal chance of being tested
i don't know i just think it's a sick thing that we've come to that i don't like the way the world's going
well
does it i've heard a lot of discussions about this and i guess the scariest part of it is the chance of a false positive
and that's what
what really upsets a lot of people who are you know very straight and probably wouldn't ever think of using drugs but the idea that they could lose their jobs
or in our case be forced to go to all this counseling and that sort of stuff you know just in the case of a false positive
no urine
yes they can and i think that's probably be more acceptable i believe it's more accurate
but that's not what they're doing at my company
but they certainly started out i believe with the managers and folks like that
yeah well
yeah i suppose i suppose it's
it's just you know the whole idea of all the hassles you'd have to go through and certainly the records that would be left behind
you know everybody has databases these days
and they know a lot more about me than i'll ever remember i'm sure
yeah well i'm certainly sure that any drug test results would become a part of that
probably so
yeah
or what seems to be more of a problem train drivers
uh-huh
oh sure
oh
yeah
huh
well i guess it would i guess so
i really haven't sorted out all my feelings on the drug testing i'm totally straight would never consider using drugs
but it sort of goes back to it's a presumption of guilt and you have to prove that you're innocent
on the other hand
do you work for ti
yes i have two a seven year old and three and a half year old
how about you
oh
oh my you are busy
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
most of unless i'm going to something special that my daughter's doing or something like that i
yeah
right yeah
yeah i know what you mean well
oh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
that's right
one of my daughters was born in june
and i had one that was born in december
but i really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new units outfits you know that are just knit
oh they're so comfortable it's just you know a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff and
but i
yeah well i don't either if we if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference
i worked part time when my oldest was a baby
and i had to wear a dress every day and
and it was a little bit hard to
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah
yeah and then when you drive home like especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in dallas uh-huh because i always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time i was afraid i'd make the car overheat
because you really
yeah because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them if you
especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which i don't have any of
no when you have children you don't even when i go to church i have to have something i can just throw in the washer when i'm through
that's right or if you get it dirty or whatever i know it
me too
i know that's how i am too
right me neither i have
and they had yesterday on the news they had some problems with the
the text
having mistakes in them
and a lot of them aren't like the history books aren't historically correct they covered up a lot of the bad things that have happened
well i think they need to
do whatever they can like i think
massachusetts put a priority on education and
and they made a lot of difference in that state and in texas i think we're like twenty ninth in spending
you know and they put through this robin hood bill but it doesn't change the amount of spending overall it just distributes the money more evenly
and so that they need to do that they need to increase spending they need to make it so that the teachers want to stay in teaching because most of the time the teachers spend
disciplining the kids instead of instead of teaching the subject now
so
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
it's more subjective than it was before
so
i don't know you know i don't know what incentive teacher has to stay in teaching
i just have one daughter she's six now she's going to richardson public schools
um-hum
right
right but the worst school districts are dallas garland carrollton
coppell really doesn't matter much it's is not at the bottom and the best is highland park richardson and plano
she's six
yeah
oh valley view mall
oh yeah there's supposed to all the calls are supposed to be from a different phone so
you know
and i and i don't know they cut back on the since mark white passed that bill about
cutting back on all the extracurricular activities that may have improved a little bit
because
i was talking to a lady the other day and that that's the first thing she said her both her children were in band and they'd quit
and she said the band teacher acted like band was the only subject that he was taking and he was suppose to spend all of his time on band
right and he was taking honors classes in all his other subjects he goes to the lewisville school district
and you know it's just ridiculous so he just quit simple as that
everything should be equal you know and there's no reason you already spend all that time in band there's no reason that he should practice more than an hour a day outside of band if he if he even has the energy especially in marching season
you know
right and what do you do when you are taking calculus and chemistry and physics two and
okay hi norma have you taken anything back lately that you've bought
well why
very good
good well do you think that consumer goods are generally getting better or worse in quality
i do too
i believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time
but i don't i believe that they're better now than they were
however i didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty three thousand miles on it
no i had moved away
it did a it heated a little bit warmer and then after one year it started heating only on one side
now i figure anybody that is dumb enough to iron
needs to have an iron that will last a long time and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last
well without even any question but i think it was the store
wal-mart
that was poor quality i think
yes
the
you spend that much on your dresses
you're really divulging very personal information
oh of course i do too
well i believe that we've been talking about five minutes and norma it is just wonderful to talk to you
you are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time
bye-bye
uh-huh
hm that's interesting
yeah reliability and an economy you know if you drive a lot
in real dollars yeah
yeah that's true but i think that's really you know that's unfortunate it's
it should probably taxed or something to
limit that
huh
yeah well i don't know
you know i guess the i was interested in like the new honda vx
has the lean burn and all that stuff supposed to be very fuel efficient so it gives you about the same kind of horsepower
and boosts your mileage by like almost ten twenty miles per gallon
almost in the fifties
well you can you know like a well civic is like a corolla or something it it's
it's not as well hey it's in some ways it's not quite as big as a taurus but then it's not too much smaller either
but
no dreams for a sports car of any kind
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh do you have those split seats that fold down
from the trunk that's a good innovation
then you could put a lot more in
huh
-at's interesting
are you one to read manuals before using something
hm
oh i don't know i don't know i like
i like those
okay do you vote regular
every one
well see that's me i've never paid any attention to voting
hum-um
oh liberal by what do you mean by liberal
well see i don't know anything about politics
what's the main what's the main difference between republicans and democrats
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay and you vote for the democrats or
usually okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
okay
no i never have
hum-um
i know i
well
i don't know that much about it i don't keep up on it and i don't feel like i
have enough knowledge on it to even you know to pick the right person
so that's what they need well
it they said something to improve voting
if they could
make it more oh easier to find out you know what's going on do you know what i mean
like
like to me i don't i didn't know what would have been wrong with i can't even remember who ran for president against bush i think it was
that woman wasn't it a woman
dukakis
okay didn't he have a woman or wasn't or was that reagan
there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while ferraro
okay
well that's what i mean like i didn't know what the difference between dukakis and bush was
you know i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis
okay i don't remember anything about dukakis
but
well they're all saying that they're going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway
that's what i mean if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and
i don't know like you know in school they didn't teach you about the government not really
hum-um
yeah
well i'm not sure they're yeah i know how they do it like with the abortion issues and stuff
uh-huh
right
right
right and like i said most of the politicians i'm the
also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway
and everybody's got you know stuff they don't want known
much knowledge i don't even remember this being on there
incentive
you i guess that would be good now i'm sure they've got it at the library
you know
i mean if i get to the library i've got two babies so i don't
yeah
but i
i don't know
oh i know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that
well a lot of people they'll vote the way their family votes you know if since you're what democrat
then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote democrat right
i mean
no
right
i lie
hm
hart was running
a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking not that i think he was good looking but
he was young
and then
i didn't think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever
but because it was he had an affair
and it just threw him out of the whole running
and a lot of people go by their
personal life when they vote
and
which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life you're going to let it come into work but
i'm sure there's a lot of people that have had
yeah
well criminal or something like that's different but
if him and his wife weren't getting along i mean
what is what effect does that have on him running for president
do you know what i mean
it's all so secretive see we really don't see the
true person anyway
right
right
the hostages that were held at that time
um-hum
i thought carter was good too and that was yeah
but i think i wasn't well let's see that's been about ten years ago right
okay so i was only fifteen or sixteen but i remember carter and i liked him yeah
no i sure don't
have you been able to enjoy some family reunions in the past that you'd like to discuss or
wow that's a that's great
um-hum
i imagine it would be with seven brothers and sisters
we
oh how nice
oh okay
uh-huh
oh dear oh dear
uh-huh i'll bet he really enjoyed that
well that's fantastic that's fantastic
well we
we're all scattered around the country i have a brother in chicago one in cleveland i have two in germany and my sister we're from a large family also my sister's pretty close to my parents
and my wife and i luckily came from the same hometown
and her family is scattered all over also so what we try an to do when we have family reunions we schedule at the same time every year
so we kind of make sure that we schedule it the same time and we all head back about that same time and things that we do to make it memorable are that we go to a resort either go water skiing horseback riding
we make it a week long affair and have a real nice vacation
another reunion we do is at christmas time this is something that a tradition that my grandparents started
and we all get together around christmas time the first the saturday right before christmas unless it's either christmas eve or a day or two before and that's the week prior to that
and the amazing thing is we've had the same santa claus and his wife have come for the last twenty six years
and so you know growing up as a kid that was always santa claus and he was the same santa claus year after year after year and it really made a very pleasant and memorable and
we all exchanged gifts as family and we got to a point where we're all growing up and we decided to have white elephant
that i find somewhat frustrating and hectic but as long as we've announced it ahead of time and sent out flyers and let everyone know
when we're going to get together and what we'll be doing it's always been very fun i've always enjoyed it and we're very family oriented people and
that makes it more special or more interesting especially when you have family from you know scattered all over the world when you can get together and discuss how their lives are and the different parts of the country too
so
uh-huh
wow
yes well we're
it's not always easy but it's very memorable boy i bet that's hard because i imagine that as a large family you were very close and had a lot of fun as family
so
so you got
okay well i'll start off being controversial i'm in favor of it
okay
yeah i think that
oh definitely any crimes against person
i feel there should be more than a slap on the hand and being sent to prison and being released in two or three years
ooh yes that's
i don't see a thing wrong with that i believe that
well it's just an example i think there's someone that's on trial right now
here in the dallas area and they were interviewing the it's a young lady was killed sometime back a young girl
and a personal trial and the reporter was asking a sup stupid question of the people outside well how do you feel about this
how do they feel about it i'm sure that
they want it over with and they want the person punished and punished properly
but
yes
yeah well i feel like the cost of someone was quoting figures made the cost at like thirty thousand dollars a year
to keep someone in prison
and well the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases there are more and more instances
being on the news where this individual was out on the streets on probation or parole and killed someone else
or seriously injured someone
yeah
yes
yes indeed
yeah
yeah
well here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind
the opportunity exists for someone to get killed
now i'm not in favor of gun control
to the n-th degree or anything because
there are uses for guns which are non criminal
but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them aside from domestic disputes husband shooting wives or vice versa
but these individuals if they have a gun with them i think that the sentence should be even longer than if they don't
well
well but here again if a matter of expediency part of these costs like the people on death row is that their appeals can take years and years there should be some i know there's a law i believe that
it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence
well i think that automatic appeal ought to take place
within a reasonable length of time say six months
and a decision be made and not drag out
in the courts
for years because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities there might be
right there's got to be a there's got to be a time limit
a legitimate appeal not a technicality of if
and they're not arguing that the guy
or woman committed the crime they're arguing over well were his civil rights violated because
someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time those are the things that have caused them to drag out i think
yeah
yeah
he didn't see his lawyer as quickly as he should have or some
mickey mouse type thing like that
there you go
well it's a case that we have a legal system which the criminals have found a way to
use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself
so
that's how we get caught in this sort of a catch twenty two
but you have to continue
to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty
yeah
but again one of our
one of our problems is that our legislature and the state and our national congress the majority of the members there of are lawyers
well do you have a lawn
oh good so who cuts the grass
well i used to own a home and when i owned my house i had a small yard and a small front yard and a small backyard then i cut the grass
but i sold it so now i live in an apartment
so i don't have to fool with any of it no
oh then my wife and you would probably get along well um-hum
yeah we talk about
laura talks about growing right now she's interested i think in a herb garden she mentioned this morning that she could grow just you know flower box
and i think that's but i think after we
after i finish school and we're ready to you know settle down someplace and i get a decent job then we'll look for something probably with a nice size yard that we can have a garden
yeah
yeah and that's the big problem with being in an apartment is we've talked about it and even laura even said you know as a wedding present we should ask for these big pots
you know that we could put on the front porch and because the apartment complex actually we have the whole front porch and somebody else lives on the other side so we thought about you know having putting it in pots and putting the pots just on our steps
and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers like right now it would be beautiful in maryland you know daffodils are just all blooming so it would be really pretty
um-hum
yep
right now we're going through we just it just rained all day today or it's been raining most of the morning drizzling off and on but yeah
oh really this is what is it i guess your growing season's just about to begin oh
um-hum
yeah
yeah see we're a little bit later than that but that's right that's about right about the same yeah
but i think i think you though must have much warmer weather through the winter so that's
um-hum
yeah
yeah and then july and august yeah
um-hum
hum
right yeah that jeez i never thought of that because see here our growing season is basically done
by well you might have some tomatoes still blooming in october the very first week of october
but normally everything's done by september end of september means you're basically done growing anything
um-hum yeah because it
oh gee that'd be nice
um-hum we don't even grow okra up here
yeah we don't have the right whatever yeah
well i think it it's getting a little bit more popular because see there's a lot of the
first you know first the big wave of tex-mex food came by you know and so we're big into tacos and stuff up here now and taco salads and things
which they probably mexican people don't even know what a taco salad is but i think it's now it's moving up too because just a change you know just something different
plus it's a little bit more vegetable oriented and i think the mid atlantic states have been a long time holdout for beef and potatoes
i think it's our irish descent
yeah but i think it it's changing now yeah so i so we do know what okra is i wouldn't have known what it was when i was a teenager though
well we were going to probably just going to start well because we're going to be moving we're talking about just putting throwing tomatoes in
you know and then but also things like tulips i think i would have liked to had flowers like daffodils blooming right now you know
um-hum
yeah we talked about that too in fact our sister-in-law laura's
brother's wife you know was talking about you know putting strawberries moving their strawberries because they just moved
i it's this problem with being in school you know they just moved and they took their strawberries that they had out in their yard and put them all in containers
and they're going to decide what they're going to do with them i think but they're going to let them bloom this year in the containers
um-hum
um-hum would you have to stake them up aren't do they grow along the ground strawberries
uh-huh
yeah
huh
oh
see i've never grown strawberries
um-hum
yeah
um-hum just water
yeah
yeah rotationary thing
oh that's interesting see because i've never really grown strawberries lot of tomatoes but never really strawberries
yeah
i can remember as a kid growing up my whole family all my family grew strawberries grew excuse me grew tomatoes
so whenever somebody would come over your house they'd always bring some tomatoes well but you grew your own tomatoes
so if somebody brings you half a dozen tomatoes it doesn't do you any good because you already had a half a dozen you know pulled that day
it's really funny
uh-huh
oh yeah
um-hum
well that's makes sense though
um-hum
oh you are a big gardener huh
yeah
yeah i guess the more you plant the less you have to mow
because that's a when i had my yard it was you know it was it was really a hassle
cutting grass was just a just the thought of it was a terrible thing oh i used to hate it
oh
yep because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy yeah
my brother went out and bought a mower used you know he was looking for a lawn mower and he just had bought a house he lived in an apartment before
and he bought a used mower it was a real big heavy one and he said that you know basically they sold it on him because you know it was a macho thing
the bigger and heavier the lawn mower the more macho the guy behind it
so you know of course he couldn't buy one of those little tiny skinny ones that you can get at one of the one of the aames or
the fast mowing places you had to buy a big one you know because it meant something for your macho same reason why you have to drive a big truck with four wheels you know with four wheel drive
it was a macho thing he had to use that but then after he used it one year he took it back to where he got it used and he sold it back to them and traded it in for another one that was smaller
because he said it was just too dang heavy
yeah trying to cut it sideways on an angle and turning around you know without it tipping over was a pain
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh well it's probably his personal time while he's cutting the grass he's probably thinking about something else
it's probably and plus no one bothers him you know you walk behind a lawn mower making all that noise no one ever talks to you know you're on your own
-y pets
wow
i have two cats
uh-huh
yeah
i bet you're attached to your chihuahua
yeah
they're so little and cute
yeah they're so little and cute
wow yeah eighteen
was it an inside or an outside cat
that's what mine are
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
right
huh
yeah mine are two characters they're only
oh i have one that is a calico and she is not very friendly
and i have one that is yellow and white long hair
and in the summer time we have to get him shaved and it's the funniest looking thing you have ever seen
his fur shaved because he mats up so bad
and he doesn't lick his coat
and he gets great big old knots all over him and then when you go pick him up he looks so funny
cause they don't shave you know their legs
no it's real strange
they call it a lion cut they shave it all the way to the collar
it's really funny he's real friendly he acts like a dog
yeah
no they don't like each other at all
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
oh really
oh neat
yeah
yeah
shy
oh my word that is shy
wow
does your dog and your daughter's dog get along
get in each other's way
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
and now this is her time
well those are so cute i just adore them
do you carry it a lot with you in the car and stuff
uh-huh
oh my word
how'd you find it
yeah
probably in the last few weeks the biggest way i've had of keeping up with what was going on in the gulf was cnn and i think maybe that's probably true for everyone
oh
well we get we get the
as we said well nothing's happening in the war because now they're interviewing the what seems to be dozens of mideast experts all at once
hm
a little much yes we have we're a town of five thousand and so our local newspaper is not too swift
um-hum
so you are off to work this morning
oh you're at work oh i assumed that these were home telephone numbers
in our town of five thousand we have one that is local fm am station and their news is fed from cnn too it's more of
um-hum
hm
um-hum
i only watch one soap opera a day and it seems to me and that's probably about once every two months since my husband retired it seems to me so often times that they cut into that soap opera
with what i don't really consider as earth shaking i guess maybe i think sometimes the coverage is almost too intent
um-hum
you mean when the reporter sticks the microphone in the person says the face and says how do you feel that you house has burned to the ground
that's a bit much isn't it
um-hum
i guess maybe they have so much time to fill i've thought often times that maybe our world was a little bit better place when i was in high school and the and the news like your radio station was on
fifteen minutes in the evening and then they went on to i don't know i think the andy williams show or something that filled up the other fifteen minutes of that half hour and we just weren't so heavy with it
well it's sure been nice visiting with you
we're having sleet and rain in indiana this morning so
okay so then do you keep kids is this two year old yours or do you keep children for other people
oh that's exactly what i have yes
i know i my little girl was three and a half in march and my son was two in january
that's pretty close
yeah
yes it is have you been able to do that all along or
yeah
oh how neat
how old were they when you adopted
so he probably doesn't remember
oh yeah definitely needed well that's pretty interesting well i have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know that was always my dream you know i wasn't necessarily a career person
but as long as i was single and had to work i was going to get a good job and do the best i could and my husband was in the type of business that you know it's insurance so you have to build a clientele and by the time we had kids i couldn't quit
and so i haven't been able to quit yet so i've had to deal a lot with child care and course we're hoping within hopefully the next two years i'll be able to quit and stay home
but i started out my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born until she went to work last year in august and it worked out pretty good you know we had always said from the beginning that
if it gets in the way of the friendship then i'll take them somewhere else you know the friendship is more important
yeah
uh-huh
yes
huh
and she had no help
she had no help she was alone with them
yeah
gee
so
yeah
yeah
right
right
yes
yeah
well when my friend decided to go back to work and whenever we had problems it worked out okay because she would come and tell me and we'd work it out
after that i found another girl that had gone to church with us that you know they needed it financially she had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy and i thought well you know we'll try her but she came to our house and that just did not work
i mean she loved the kids and she was good with them but
you know they were filthy when i'd get home now i understand kids go out and play and they get dirty but i mean filthy i'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair and the and i was like gosh and then
you know my own furniture and stuff was like you know the kitchen table the i'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs and the and clean and i was like
yeah and then in the end she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me so i was i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth she told me about five thirty one afternoon it was a friday that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of monday morning
well you know i work eight to five thirty so what am i supposed to do
so i well i had been sick and i it ended up that i didn't go to work monday because i was sick so i stayed home with them and we went to some of the kindercares
yeah well that's what they said there were two pretty near our house and they said well bring them in this week for a free day so i lined up someone tuesday they had a mother's day out that my babysitter took them to you know which was fine they liked it they'd been going to it for years
and so i stayed with them monday tuesday they went to that wednesday i took them to one kindercare thursday i took them to another kindercare and then on friday my husband and i split but on thursday i didn't like the kindercare's they
they didn't give him
oh
oh that's horrible
like public they're not private you know they can't pray they can't talk about god they can't do anything like that and i don't want them indoctrinated you know but i'd like them to be able to say gee god made the flowers you know and things like that
yeah basic so i talked to another
lady at church it was like thursday of that week and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i've been taking my daughter and i've know this girl i went to college with her so i really i you i value her opinion
and she told me about a private one it was associated with one of the churches here it's not the church i go to but it's you know it was lubbock view christian church and it's a private academy
and so i went over there and i talked to the lady well they have like a three year waiting list but she said i had a mother tell me that she may take a job in san antonio and she has a three year old and a toddler which mine was at the time
and she said i should know something by tomorrow which is friday and she said if she leaves she said i'll let you have her spot
i love it i have been at such peace with myself it's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles and
the cost was not near as much as the kindercares were going to be did you hear my printer in the background i'm sorry i hope you can understand what i'm so yeah i was only about twenty dollars more a month than i was paying because
being a private institution they're nonprofit
so they don't have to charge as much and the hours are wonderful and i just i think it's the best thing i told russ that we should have done this a long time ago
you know the alphabet the numbers the things which you know if they learn they learn if they don't they don't i don't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three but it's kind of neat when they come home with it you know and
yeah
and you know they get over it real quick and he doesn't do it anymore and
it is
i know
i know and that's hard
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah and that's usually like you know i don't know when mine were going to mother's day out it was like from nine to three so that was a pretty good pretty good time you know my babysitter would take them and then pick them up
so that worked out real good
well i'm tickled to death i hope you find something and it was good talking to you
and you too bye
oh really so you do you don't
pay attention to primary sources
like tv or
oh that's interesting
what about television
um-hum
oh well i'm pretty much of a space cadet a zombie i really don't know much what's going on i guess mostly of what i get is from the news from the excuse me from the newspaper
i don't have a television so that doesn't help
i get a daily newspaper and i think newspapers are better then television for in depth news they
the television actually is good in particularly when we're you're talking about personalities because you can get a heck of a lot more through complete audio visual presentation like for example in the political debates and what not
than you do through distilled string of words in the newspaper but
actually for indepth information the newspaper is definitely better because the television just presents highlights and doesn't really go much indepth
can't really because they don't have the time
and when i'm on
airplanes i will use i will read news magazines
my son likes news magazines but
i
i guess i just never get around to reading them
it's sort of a tradition to read the newspaper over breakfast but
yeah
yeah
sort of
sort of a relaxing time
nope
nope
in quotes
i don't i don't listen to the radio but my son does
of course he's thirteen and
his idea of music is not quite the same as my idea of music
oh yeah well when i'm driving in the car that's right sometimes well driving in the bay area is risky in the since that you may run into traffic problems
so i will tune in to news station
where they every ten minutes they give traffic information
and
as a sort of a side effect i get news that way
um-hum
well it's a beautiful day here in california i'm standing outside of a phone booth you know when you call in you're supposed i guess you're supposed to call from different numbers so
i call from a bunch of pay phones and whatnot
and it's sort of a cloudy i would say broken skies mostly not quite overcast but almost overcast
and
that's your current event
news cast from
good well i'm my name's gail and i guess we have to talk about credit cards
okay well if you're ready then
okay i'll press one
i think they're kind of dangerous
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's true that's true seems just like our society is so
pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this they're really trying to get you into that situation because they know they've really got you then
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
it's just you know you just never get it out
uh-huh
well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure we'll give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed
for the truck and they said sure that's no problem but you know why don't we consolidate your bills
and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could and it's gonna be a lower payment than it was for all of them you only have to write one check a month not all those you never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didn't realize at the time
until several months later that
we were real i mean this was four year three years ago we were
pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didn't you know about six months later we realized we could use them and so we charged them all up again
definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church talking about debt and things like that i just it's so
so alluring and so easy to get sometimes
um-hum
yeah
oh so i don't know if i if i just feel kind of i my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our visa card and i just thought
you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one and we would really need that and
now we just don't
hi maureen
we are supposed to be talking about children and spending time with them today
neither one of us have any children but it might be interesting if we talked about what we thought we would do if we had children or perhaps you know what some of our friends do and what we approve or do not approve of
do you have nieces and nephews or anything
uh-huh
it will be fun though
uh-huh
uh-huh
i'm sure
try milo and otis
uh-huh
the dog and the cat
uh-huh
the whole family would enjoy that
yes
yes
probably some of that went over their heads anyway
oh so you got to walk around and watch everything
and
i would say that his mother is probably like one of the perfect mothers she
it's just one of those kind of deals that she spends a lot of time with him she listens to what he has to say and he is turning out he is thirteen he is turning out to be a really good kid
and i think whatever she has done you know she has done it right but i think it takes and awful lot of time and effort to raise kids too
you know i watch our neighbors and everything they do is child related
it's like their whole social lives kind of flow around
where they are taking the kids and what they are doing with the kids
which may be part of the reason we never had kids
uh-huh
right people are beginning to where they do not view you as such a social pariah anymore
but well you still get you know particularly if you are around a bunch of people with kids they still tend to look at you a little strangely if you do not have them but i am running into more and more people who have opted not to have kids
so i do not feel quite so bad
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my gosh
uh-huh
yeah plus when they are that old you know it's not as though they are going to go out and rough and tumble with the kids like a younger parent would
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
was that the rape murder of that sixteen year old girl in a school
um-hum hm
hm
well actually i mean not with regard to capital punishment i mean just in general the media
they the average person in the media is far more liberal than the average person in the rest of the country and so
views that are more conservative just don't get adequately represented in the mainstream media that's been documented by a number of studies but on capital punishment look that's an exception i'm not conservative on that i'm sort of middle of the road i lean against capital punishment but
i wouldn't be an activist on it cause there's so many more important things i think i mean i admit that some innocent people get killed and i believe you're correct that has been documented it happens occasionally and it's very that's quite unfortunate
didn't say you know even that even the fraction that would be represented among criminals are convicted more often
i don't know that you know maybe it was a news report i heard or something where i couldn't check it out very carefully where i couldn't i always tend to read over these things you know
especially if you have an interest group that comes up with a study that supports their own position if they did the work i always tend to be a little suspicious of it and that might've been the southern poverty law project or something that did that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
if you find out you put somebody in jail wrongly you can just let them out if you find out that you killed somebody wrongly there's nothing you can do to bring them back to life so
if north carolina didn't have capital punishment i wouldn't try and institute it does have capital punishment i don't see that it does any good
the fortunate thing really is that it occurs so rarely i think we have about maybe one execution or a little bit less a year in north carolina now i
i know there're some states like i think texas is probably the leader in the country i'm not sure of that but i think it may be is that right
um-hum
hm
yeah i think that you know most southern states tend to have capital punishment more than northern states and a state like minnesota for example i don't know but i'd be almost sure that they don't have capital punishments wisconsin the same way
hm
um-hum
uh-huh
okay
yeah i guess one of the differences i see is working for a university
there is room for advancement but not so much so our in
quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an in administrative association so there is a
progressive path but
not being in the
say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people
like
yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have
a broader scope for rewarding people for
their performances
so that's
in our situation where we're dealing with an institution
it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution
perhaps somewhat even with the business
but i agree you know the medical benefits and those kinds of things are
one of the
big pluses for working for a large organization and also the
security aspect for long term employment
job security yes
uh-huh
yeah we're seeing that here as well like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive layoffs
so i think there it's probably a major distinction between
institutions and the corporate world
in institutions are slower to
react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses
we need to cut back that's what we do
but
yeah and institutionally like here at the university
well in one sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles
so we end
it's very easy
yeah
right because it's the support people that are providing the speed for it
well
the
that's maybe the majority of the importance i guess
yeah because my perspective is from an institution
the there is not much incentive for
innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe
but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for
i guess in innovation although
he the you know the more complex your structure
the less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
but i think there is
it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's
things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts
right
yeah you end up being your own person
and if you do your job fine and if
somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem and
you know you really
yeah it becomes the organization instead of
person being you know a part of the individual themselves
what do you think about gun control
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah and i think i think that is right
the only thing i object to is like machine guns and
yeah
do you think
just this last year it seems like he's he was and he was not that bill does not restrict anything outside of just having to wait seven days but
it is interesting that he turned around for some reason
um-hum
um-hum
i think and i think a lot of times you know that criminals do not go out and buy a
what a good gun costs like two hundred to five hundred dollars
you know a handgun they go out and buy the cheapest thing they can
and then they go rob a liquor store or something
yeah that is true
right
um-hum
um-hum
that is right
and a lot of times like
what is his name i can't remember his name right the guy in the austin tower whitman
you know he was sane and i guess they could have said like lee harvey oswald was sane when he bought his gun you know but he bought his by mail anyway
but later on you know something can happen they can they can have a brain tumor or they can break down one way or another
right
um-hum
right
yeah he might have
um-hum
yeah
yeah that is true because you know once they start clamping down on one thing or being against one group then the
it gives them a foothold to be against somebody else
and the hunters you know the hunters
with what game species there are left well especially i mean using a rifle white tail deers mostly
you know that is what people hunt for the most with a rifle
you know they have every right to have a
a rifle and be able to hunt
um-hum
and that i think it was a rifle that kid shot that burglar with in arlington or wherever it was
yes i think it's two years ago or so now
you know
um-hum
yeah i wondered how he managed that
um-hum
exactly
um-hum
and more and more of that kind of thing happens i mean can you imagine i mean it used to be like with the dapper bandit is one guy you know
with a gun and a lot of the stuff that he did they did not publicize
because it would breach the security of the rest of the banks
one of the things that he did is any counter top that was there up to maybe like four feet high he could vertical jump on top of the counter top and jump down and be
with those people behind the counter before they knew it
you know and they showed us a piece of tape of that one time but it looked like they had cut it up some that was one of the things that was so scary about him
and not only did he rob banks but he
he jumped he jumped back there with her and you know there was nothing she could do by that time
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i would
yeah and then
um-hum
yeah right
like the judge what was it two or three months ago the judge in fort worth i think
maybe it was dallas
but he just convicted a man for murder and the guy jumped up and apparently knew where the judge kept his gun
and held it on him for a couple of hours you know and
he should he should either have kept it fairly well concealed or kept it a secret
right
right
right
well i'm
i'm kind of with you they've definitely run into some problems and i think it's
it's some it's due to their own shortsightedness perhaps the trying to do
the variables that might
crop up and then they've been hit with a lot of those a lot of i think they've had a lot of poorer poor management here in the past several years no clearly defined goals
a
the soviets have done a better job of that you know they were very
they were limited so much in their technology and but they because of that they tended to say what we're going to do what we do
and continue to do it and do it over the long haul and so that's what they've done and they've
they've you know they they've had a man in space for you know a quite a long time you know in
in the different space stations that they've had and so that you know that's been good for them they've learned a lot and they've made some achievements in that respect but they've been
doing it very slowly and very long range you know
and we haven't done that we tend to look at a big
you know up in the next ten years and you can't do that you know i mean it's just not
not feasible but you know the americans american publics doesn't like to sit back and wait
especially with funding the way it is yeah
i think there are definite benefits from the from
the process of creating space projects you know we you know we've seen that in terms of computers and the myriad of different
technological advances but
like you say you have to kind of weigh that as to what is it worth in the long you know for the overall picture how much we willing to put out for
right
right
right
right
you know i mean i would love to see you know big things like that happen i i've you know i've i went through the entire and i grew up in that early sixties you know big boom of
of you know all those mercury and gemini and apollo shots and was real caught up in that and would love to see something
big happen you know i'd like to see that occur but like you say it's a it is a drain and you don't it would cost
an enormous amount of money to put that up yeah put something up like a space station that would work and really be beneficial for us and i don't i don't know it's if it's worth it
yeah
yes we live right to the base of the wasatch front so as our children were growing up we spent a lot of time camping up in the mountains different taking our children with us or deer hunting or whatever
weekend or go up into yellowstone park and camp in the campgrounds up there
but we really had some enjoyable times as a family and some real good memories how about your experiences on camping what have you
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that sounds
uh-huh
oh wow
all those fun things huh
we've seen a lot of rattle snakes in our camping trips
and all of those creatures of the wild and like you say those really make memories of things the kids never forget but
i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and that's when this moose great big antlers come walking right through our campground we had a fire going and it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and
no he we didn't bother it and everything was fine but
it's camping has really been a great part of our life and now we're older all of our kids are gone and we don't
fact last year was the first year i didn't go out camping on the deer hunt now we have quite a deer hunting season here in utah and i didn't first time in fifty four years that i hadn't gone out in the mountains for the deer hunting so
but anyway it
yeah when the grandkids get a little bit older then we'll do that again
oh uh-huh
uh-huh well i would it's not like camping in a way but yet it is you're still on the
right
yes we got where we had a camper then we got us a fifteen foot trailer house that we took up and
when we were going camping so we when we our kids were young we did pretty well rough it we were in some good snowstorms and
speaking about tornados up in yellowstone one went through there usually they don't have such things here but
it took down pine trees quite a swath and we were there right after that happened but
those tornados i guess are pretty scary things
um-hum that was amazing because that was like i say right up in yellowstone and it's maybe once every hundred years or something we have something like that but and it happened and that was
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
oh it is it's beautiful we've spent a lot of time up there and that but that's a long ways to pull a trailer
yeah
i'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly
i find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use
cause the air pollution and it just doesn't seem like
but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know and it it's kind of dangerous
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
but you think the mountains and the are kind of a barrier hum that's a
that's an interesting thought
um-hum
um-hum
here in texas i know a lot of the
pretty much every place here is relatively flat and so i would think that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a like a smog problem or something like that i'm not sure
huh
um-hum
i yeah i guess i've never really thought about the fact that like in california they have a lot of smog problems
you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them i don't know what you call them and different things like that
um-hum
um-hum
aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something
hum
oh okay
um-hum
uh-huh the diesel oh yeah
but
no i don't i work in waco at a tv station so my mother works at ti so that's how i
yeah do you work at t i oh okay
okay
oh okay that's interesting
what else causes air pollution noise
noise causes air pollution and noise pollution
hum how funny
oh yeah landfills yeah
we just
yeah we just had a big thing here in waco they're needing to open a new landfill or to expand onto the old landfill
and it it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded because they're thinking that their water is going to be contaminated somehow and so they
yeah
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
and one of the big concerns is they have a there's a school right across the highway from the landfill yeah so the parents were really upset
um-hum yeah and they've been fighting over it for the last year and they just now approved it so they were gonna try an appeal or something
i don't know i guess that's you would consider that a home repair certainly
you did that recently too huh does it make a big difference
we went through a process of home repairs on a on a rental house we had probably the most extensive and the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do
didn't have very much money and so we had to do it ourselves in a kind of a slow process but we learned how to do
retile bathtubs and
oh just all kinds of things that are kind of unusual
ah
yeah
um-hum
that's awful howard and i were talking about home repair the other night in connection with scouting you got a scouter coming up and
i think it's neat for young people to learn how to take care of their
of a household you know like fixing faucets and drippy faucets and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that
um-hum
how did the how did the paneling looks lots better do you do you like it better
yeah
yeah
yeah that's nice isn't it
nice to have it come out to positive and look good
yeah well we have a lot that needs to be done we have we have carpeting and we did have a new floor put in our kitchen and
i have my mother living with us and so she was in a
a room with a carpet and course she's quite aged she's ninety three now so that meant she had problems now and then and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down so it was easier to clean and
it was fairly expensive though i'm i was impressed i think that we had somebody do it and it was
it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet
kind of depends on the on the quality of carpet i suppose but
in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and fix the floor so it's
i don't know whatever but they have to put stuff on the floor and it's kind of a process so
well it sounds like you've had some pretty good experiences with home repair
are do you work outside the home
and do you have small children
oh okay
i also work outside the home full time
i do have small children though
it does make it very difficult i think that our culture has
broadened quite a bit so that it is very acceptable for a woman to do so
and
well yeah but i didn't i
i never found it difficult
as a woman my i'm in the medical field and so i don't i i'm not in a field that is typically a man's field i'm not a surgeon i'm not a doctor
what is typically a man's role are you in a are you in a job that
yeah
yeah it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
my sex really has much to do with
i do have trouble i'm a physician assistant which is
somewhere between a nurse and a doctor
and i frequently see patients without the doctor seeing them
and it is a it's not uncommon that the
it's typically hispanic males
typically hispanic males do not want me to be their medical you know their medical care provider that day
they really have a problem with it and they'll and they will almost always ask me to see the doctor
and their i i'm talking about the ones who came from mexico not the ones that were reared in the states
i'm talking primarily about you know the guys that are over here on work thesis
you know that sort of thing but their culture is still very much though
not a woman's thing and i'm a blonde and they are just like you know who is this girl why is she in here telling me anything
yeah so they
so that's the only place i've ever even had a problem
regarding my sex sometimes my size is one limitation because i assist in surgery too
sometimes i wish i were strong as a man but or the average man anyway
um-hum
um-hum
i don't i don't
i don't see how i can ever get back on track i don't see that as being a possibility i will i will never work
seventy hour weeks again
i mean i don't i
yeah seventy hour weeks every week i mean it was nothing i mean that was what i did every week and but i don't not only
i mean i can't any longer my husband works a full time job outside the home too
and not only i mean i physically cannot do it because of day care et cetera
but i don't want to the desire is not there
and i am not someone i didn't think i had the desire to be a mother even
and yet the children had transformed me and the mothering has transformed me to the point
i don't even think i would go interview again
i you know it's i mean i love what i do but i love my children so much more
and there's
there is a guilt that goes along with leaving them to in the hands of other people
that aren't you
there's a fear there too i'm not really afraid of what might be happening to them
in an in an abuse issue but i'm afraid of what they're missing i'm afraid of what
of what's not being you know
discussed with them or what or what opportunities are missed
that i could fill in
so that fear's there
yeah
right see the kids
just learn about me i mean learn what i want them to be learn the things that are truly important to me because if you just tell them it doesn't count
it's what they see routinely that they remember
it's that they see routinely that you deal with the you know with the gardener in a in a nice manner
that they see routinely that you are
they need to see that instead of you just telling them well after you go to bed at night i
you know stuff envelopes for the crippled children's association you know that doesn't count they need to see what it is you spend your time and your energy doing
in order to get part of you otherwise they grow up with parts of their child care or there care givers
um-hum
yeah
yeah it's a tough thing i don't if you if you have children you know
um-hum
it's incredible
it's
it is the most life changing experience i have ever i mean i had no idea i never even wanted children
and then we were blessed with one in an expected fashion and i mean i just i can't believe it i mean i can't believe this is me
and neither can anybody else
you know i mean but it's just phenomenal
it is absolutely phenomenal
the proposal
uh-huh
the boys
not the girl just the boys
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum i thought it would be good too but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the peace corps
because not all young people would have what it takes to go like that
because i think it takes a certain person to be able to do something like that but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done
um-hum
right
right
yes
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's what i wondered what
it'd be a good character builder
huh
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
well people that are
have received sentences in jail they have some of them are going out and doing they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is good
um-hum
um-hum
well i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like you know what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood
some of the people how they live or
you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah because that's one thing that's hard with young people you can't tell them how things are they have to see for themselves and
now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years i don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done
uh-huh
um-hum of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction
you know they their teenage years and that they really sometimes need
a little better direction to go
and something course now peace corps that couldn't be done of course until they were done with school
in such
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
kind of an in between time
yeah
um-hum
yeah
huh-uh
no and like i said not now all young people should be able to do something but
and they just aren't able to do it
but
a lot of companies now are using drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to root out the either
yeah elementary or intermediate or advanced drug users
and i know that government is you know gives drug tests to all new entrants all new applicants coming into government
and i quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it i i'm guess i'm not a good civil libertarian
and i feel as though that you know that if you are a drug user you have a hidden agenda
and so but sometimes you know drug use can escape that
and i have absolutely no compunction about using any and all means to you know work out figure out who has a drug program or has a drug problem
and putting that guy into therapy to
or whatever it is to you know break this activity of course if he's fallen in love with drugs
and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems be meaningful
what's your feeling
um-hum well i think the laws on the first morphine laws were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that
yeah
well the thing of it is the that is in many respects
you know just a i think an over simplification i think there the there's so much criminal activity
that people go into to support drug habit
yeah you know they support drug habits with you know with things like you know burglary or prostitution or stuff like that yeah
i must admit that
hm
yeah
yeah i must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the
and the costs to society yeah
but we see
yeah as soon as we wind up you know
well i think if we could just destroy the market by destroying the demand but people will wanna get stoned and i don't see that
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
i oh i guess we have one miniature dachshund
oh i don't think i could cope with that many how do you avoid having your house smell
um-hum
okay i knew somebody who said they were easy to litter box train but she had trouble with it chewing on wood
oh how what kind of a dog do you have
do they get along
and our dog just about has a stroke
well
um-hum
well we kind of joke that our dog's about eight years old and but one son was between jobs for a couple of weeks and was here with a golden retriever
and when he left you know we swear the our dog's muzzle turned white
and then our other son
is in the navy and was being relocated to go to school down at college station so he was here for a couple days in between waiting for his household goods and stuff and with a beagle puppy
well i think they're i think they're good company i have been trying for years to convince my mother who lives alone
that she would like a dog she loves it when she comes here and our dog sits on her lap you know and she'll just sit there and pet him and pet him and i'll say you need an animal he would
and
yes um-hum
well and i think they're good for kids in that they can teach the kids responsibility
you feeding it making sure it has water and you know just all that kind of stuff that's good also
but we just have a we in the past we've had great danes
oh they were well the first one we had was wonderful she just finally died of old age but she was just so the greatest house pet and we were asked when she was probably about ten years old when our youngest one was born
and she would totally ignore this baby i mean the dog could be laying there sleeping and somebody could carry this child into the room and the dog would just kind of
now he just really likes having a dog that curls up in his lap when he watches tv and sits in his recliner and falls asleep
what
actually to tell you the truth i think jury selection is a prime
discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on
finding of guilt
yeah i think there's a limit on that the peremptory challenges are limited to i don't know how many but you can
hm
yeah i it seems to me i'm always challenged peremptorily also when i go to these things i think i have a severe demeanor or something
but typically you know typically
everyone gets involved in the jury process and
i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who's well educated to be able to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice
right
so
so if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd have to have nincompoops to
hm
um-hum
hm
um-hum
hm
um-hum
hm
um-hum
well i suppose you may be right on that
as a matter of fact i've heard that
i've heard that some of the information is prevented from reaching the jury like mitigating circumstances or preceding criminal record or things of this nature that
oh is it oh i didn't realize that okay
right
um-hum
um-hum
so what you're saying is if this is the second offense then you execute them
um-hum
what about white collar crimes like theft of trade secrets
oh really
like what
hm
well it's a topic that my husband and i often discuss because
i don't have any grandparents and my mother is deceased so we think about that often times with my father but there's plenty of other siblings to help out
however on my husband's side he has one sibling who is mentally retarded and then his parents and so we wonder you know how we're going to make ends meet once they're gone
you know my mother-in-law constantly says things like you know well i wish if one of us goes i wish we'd all go like in a car accident so that nobody would help nobody would have to worry about it but
it's a scary issue i think
uh-huh
wow
wow
yes i know
one
i think that's kind of the ideal situation is to have a combination retirement home nursing home and even you know if they need special care
my husband's grandmother is in a nursing home and
i don't think they've termed what she has as alzheimer's but it you know she reverts a lot back to her childhood
and she doesn't know who you are often times she does the one thing that she retains as far as her memory is concerned is hymns
you know religious hymns she can sing them and remember all the verses but when you talk to her she doesn't know who you are but
the home that she is in it seems like a nice home but there are a lot of people there that are really bad badly off and they have them all combined together
and so her roommate
is a person who entered herself into the home because she has really bad arthritis but mentally she is completely there so you know i don't know about that type of situation where
you know you have a mixture but there is a home here in dallas that it's a methodist home
they have that kind of situation it seems like what you were talking about with your parents retirement home and a nursing home
you know and even a hospital somewhat attached you know for those who need
you know really special care and i think that would what be what i would desire if i had to one of those
that's about
oh really
yeah
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
is he
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah it's i mean i've you know i've seen people that you know definitely got screwed by the system
before yeah is do they have the death penalty in new york
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
constitutional
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
in tennessee
you know one thing that i've always that i've one idea that i've heard that i've you know kind of had some sympathy for is though that you know when you have someone that's
you know that you know that you are going to be stuck is going to be stuck with life imprisonment you know or two hundred and fifty years you know none of it served you know at the same time that you know to give them the choice of having the death penalty
it seems you know if you lock him away for the rest of his life you know
uh-huh
and that always that always seemed to be you know some sort of
um-hum
oh like in texas
how did you first get involved in camping
yeah
uh-huh
are you a native texan
oh okay
i guess i grew up camping my folks were big campers from day one as far as i can remember we grew up in southern oklahoma and they were we were always hit texoma or
some camping area all of either texas or oklahoma
and i was involved in boy scouts as a young kid and we were camping seem like every other weekend we would go somewhere
i when they talk about the definitions of camping it kind of struck me as funny my brother and sister-in-law
who live in arlington and go camping a lot during the spring and summer and fall but their idea of camping is a little bit different than mine they have a fifth wheel trailer that they pull
that has you know two bedrooms a tv and microwave and stove and all that kind of stuff and he pulls it with a big pickup
when i when i when i go camping i usually take a sleeping bag and some cooking stuff and that's about it
well it's not like leaving home when you take it with you the whole idea is to get away from it
i have been and some of the boy scouts have been up in there they have got some great hiking trails and camping areas up in there
um-hum
i'm not familiar with that one
yeah
oh yeah
boy that's a fact
they i have heard they since changed name of the park to something else but it was one of those parks with a natural
spring fed river that flows through the camp sites you know all along the river the water was real cold because it was spring fed but just like i say it's a beautiful area lots of hills to go camping in
dad never believed in tent camping we had some old army cots that we would sleep on come
good weather or not a many of times we were sleeping out under the stars and it would start raining and we would all wind up in the car and that got pretty cramped sometimes
no i haven't i've never been up there
yeah
well that that's true i've never i've heard about it countless times but never thought about going up there
yeah
well
well that would be great there pretty
shoot let come what may
and they're fairly close to the water aren't they i mean they're right on the late
they got a place where you can keep your boat while you're there for the weekend
yeah
that
yeah
oh yeah
yeah so it's time to quit
that's great i'd forgotten all about the texan side and that's but you got to be a member of texans to use it
yeah
oh that's outstanding
oh yeah
i've got a boy that is thirteen and the girl is eleven the boy had learned to
ski oh probably two years ago he's a slalom skier now and the girl's eleven and she just now starting to learn to ski
i've got a sixteen and a half foot bayliner it's inboard outboard just a ski boat it's about the right size for us
yeah i know them
you bet
goodness
yeah i expect it would
yeah but boy it would move you across the water though
that's what you want plus out on texoma you have got all that you know mass of water to get across
outstanding
uh-huh
you're right
absolutely that's what happened to us we had a boat for several years in early marriage and along came the kids and it kind of sat there
so we wound up selling it and it's been about i'd say eleven years since we got back into boating and then now they are big enough to
well i guess we've had our five minutes so we'll call this thing to a halt i appreciate talking to you bill
sure
well i had only had the boat two years now most of the time we either go out to lavon or we have been going up into arkansas she her parents live up on beaver lake in northwest arkansas real good it's
dammed up the white river real pretty in arkansas lake but we are hoping to explore a lot of the lakes around texas and just stay close to home
oh right yeah
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
it's not over crowded
yeah
well that see that's one of my biggest gripes about texoma as many times as we would go up there it's so rough
that sounds
oh no
well that sounds like a good place to start out this spring i am looking forward to it
all right thanks a lot bill nice talking to you good bye
right
really i are there any particular reason you're not into gambling or
oh really in france
yes
uh-huh
um-hum
no my in-laws have and i stay steer away from boats as much as possible only because i can't take it
really
um-hum
right exactly
um-hum
i yes everything i see that they brought back it i definitely agree
um-hum
oh yes
much definitely prefer warmer climates than alaska so i would probably head for the caribbean
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum yeah
oh yes several times
we had bought
really it it's just beautiful i just
i would be very happy staying in hawaii and becoming a beachcomber when i retire which isn't too far off which is something i might wanna consider but
i you know i've been tempted i've gotten down as far as san antonio but i've never gone down to really to the coastline
uh-huh
um-hum
yes it is and you have to do that people that go and they only go to one area you have to see it all
yes very good well it's nice talking to you okay um-hum bye-bye
okay camping my camping experiences are
using a trailer a terry eighteen foot mobile trailer and that's you know like going to lakes and stuff like that
setting up the trailer for a weekend or a week or ten days or whatever what's your thoughts on camping
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah that's up here in new england that's we call that backpacking which is the same thing which is you're you've got everything on your back you know an aluminum camp frame
the older you get the more convenience you try to bring with you i guess so i'm up to dragging the trailer around which is my next step is going to be probably winnebago i hope if i only can afford one but that
of course camping again is like you say that your backpacking is i guess what i would call true camping i'm not
i'm not sure that the other type of camping is nothing more than a leisure or
that's right that's right we have we have around the lakes and ponds up here and stuff we have campsites that are barriers set aside for each like the each individual trailer and you have a sewer hookup and water and electricity
and you back in you know and or just pull into your spot and
some you can rent by the year some you can rent daily or nightly or by the week or whatever
oh really
is that a pretty nice place
yeah
i spent about ten years in abilene for ti i worked out there in abilene in west texas and i never did get a chance to get over to lake texoma i wished i had
oh yeah that folds out from it it's like a crank up top thing you yeah it's you're talking of a trailer type that you pull huh yeah okay
yeah you can that's about the price of them up here they're sears sells them coleman sells them
they have some good buys on them and those are pretty nice i they're have a little galley a little sink that's got some compressed air and water in it and a little stove that's like a propane stove
the nice thing about dragging that is that it's very convenient to travel on the highway with because it's very low
mine is like pulling a big house behind you know
yeah t e r y terry
well they're i guess
they're pretty popular up this way yeah it's a pretty rugged trailer it's a tandem wheel even though it's only eighteen foot long so there's it drags pretty good you know with a car but
i've got a big oldsmobile that i pull it with when i
if i get rid of that i'll have to get rid of the trailer because i don't i'm not sure what else will be able to lug it around the hills up here
kind of hilly country up through this way but
well i like camping i did a lot of it i when my kids were small of course they're all grown now and gone i've got four boys and they've kind of all gone and
we don't really do that together much anymore as they've out two are out in california and two are still in texas so we kind of don't get together but maybe once a year and then we just do a little fishing but
i wished i had the opportunity to do camping because i used to love to live at the lake all summer and into the fall and
it was kind of pretty nice but i just wish that i had an opportunity to do a little more
the thing that i then again i tried pulling the trailer one year and i went everywhere with the trailer like to beaches and to stuff but that got to be a hassle you know breaking down and setting up and breaking down so i decided that
i would lease a spot on this particular lake here in northern new england and go there every spring and stay there all summer and it really worked out good for me
oh yeah
yeah
no i drive from the campground
which it adds maybe twenty miles you know each way but it's not all that much
twenty is just going a little different way it's probably twenty miles longer than my normal way to work i live in rhode island work in massachusetts but
it's it just adds about twenty miles to it but it's worth it to get to the campground and be just be out in the country and the woods all by yourself or you know with just a few neighbors around or so
and that's pretty nice because you can fish and just
i enjoy doing it i wished i had more time to do it but hopefully i can get up a retirement here before too much longer and then
i'll be looking forward to like i say with a winnebago because as the older you get the less things you want to do
but it's been nice like i really appreciate talking with you and i thought i'd give you a call on my lunch time here today and worked out good
i thank you very much you're ever up this way look me up here at ti in attleboro
thanks sir
well that could be ross perot is not a politician i mean
this is kind of new to him
i don't know are you familiar with things that he's done in the past that have gotten quite a bit of attention
like rescuing the eds employees that were being held in jail in tehran
he hired some retired army guys to go in after him and supposedly even i think went in by with went in to see them disguised you know as somebody else
but he at least ended up over there in one of the neighboring companies countries probably afghanistan or something to meet them when they came out of
out of iran
and i think he was maybe a little getting a little bit involved in politics or something during the vietnam war he tried to send supplies over to the prisoners
and since then he's started a new company but i think he must be a very good salesman or at least he was at some time
my impression is that he's a pretty honest person
oh i i've heard him on the radio and whatnot i mean he just seems very forthright he doesn't have to play games
i mean that he
that's right that's right i i'm just curious to see what's gonna happen to the political scene if he gets on the ballot in all the states and whatnot do you do you think he cans be a spoiler for bush
all the backslapping
yeah
yeah could be
could be i also suspect that one aspect of his personality would be that he would be really tenacious
or maybe stubborn even i don't know so i don't know you know he might
yeah
yeah
yeah it's
certainly different i mean bush is wealthy
but nothing like that
i mean i don't know what they put perot's wealth at i think it's probably a few billion or something i
yeah
well i
in a way i i'm interested in his candidacy i'd like to i'd like to kind of
i assume you have kids
oh well she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet
ah
well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation i was a substitute teacher for about a year
yeah i thought i wanted to be a teacher so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it
and they
in alabama where i came from they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me
yeah
hum
well i sometimes wonder if i didn't mess up i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can
if you have to you can get mean with them
those little kids don't understand it
um-hum
yeah
exactly
and two most people don't have that option
you know and plus it also depends on the district you're in as i mean on the i've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do
accept for the private ones of course we're talking about public
i mean you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and
usually bending over to get five of the best
but now nowadays they can't even they can barely scold the children for something you know without getting sued
oh yeah
well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class
and
this kid comes to school with his lunch box
and inside this lunch box he's got
easily two i'd say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills
and i asked him what are you doing with that
he says my father gave it to me
and i didn't believe it for a minute
so but you know the not a lot i could do about it
can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants
well i have i i've fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing
he was a
well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something
but not a lot i could do about it
um-hum
yeah because that just that doesn't do a lot for them i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesn't do anything for them
i don't know guns and
i don't know that's something
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah
oh sure i mean it's indicative across the board that we we've done something wrong
and when you see koreans and chinese and japanese who are taking all the science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs
and you know here we are we can't we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator
i don't know
um-hum
yeah
no
yeah
and i just same sort of thing they just you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester
and it's how well you can remember it all
yeah and i found that a particularly useless way of studying
i never did i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize
and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories
but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned
so it didn't show me anything a year and a half i gave it up
so
well i don't know what can we do about it
money is not the answer
yeah i mean they're throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well i don't know i as much as i didn't like school when i was going through it
from my perspective now i can see that it's a lot better
than what we have now
and i think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school
you know i mean it's silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline
yeah exactly i mean i
i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something
to students because they're going get they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something
oh yeah
well i think i think i mean what we've turned the schools into now are just day care centers
you know somebody okay we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day and he's out of our hair
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents
you know they just
oh sure i mean you can you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything at home then it's not going to help either
so i don't know i don't know what the i don't know what the answer is
it's an interesting thing you want to do i how is texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hum
got taken to court by the school system
i'm glad the parents won i mean that's
seems silly that i mean we started that's the that's the way you got your education in this country
and then
greg i'm not familiar i think you guys in indiana don't you have the death penalty
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
right
um-hum
when i was in when i was an undergraduate i was a member of amnesty international
and of course at that time you know i thought it's it was stupid to kill anybody for you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder
a good solution to capital punishment might be reserve it solely for repeat offenders of a crime like murder
yeah
yeah it seems sensible and fail-safe i don't you know not completely fail-safe but if a man's convicted of two murders you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
big time drug importers like say noriega for example these people need to be eliminated
from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because really any kind of
jail sentence for them is just another chance to
you know the
uh-huh
right
right
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
that's true yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
sure yeah i understand i understand your point
yeah of course you know with dahlmer now you realize that i think it's ohio gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty
yeah
that was something is sort of nightmarish to say the least
well here in texas we i think even this last week
last week they had another they you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection
what are your thoughts
uh-huh
no
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah i on sunday night i was listening to the radio and they had they had speculated that there was some rumor that tsongas was thinking of running again
uh-huh
uh-huh
it doesn't seem like it's useful for him to doesn't it seem like a waste of money though for him to come back into the race this late what are his chances of winning at this point
exactly
uh-huh
uh-huh sure
yeah what did you think about the buchanan this term
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
right well it's yeah i agree with you it does seem that he came in and kind of fluffed the pillows you know for the for the campaign anyway so we didn't have to hear the same thing again
with the gulf war and all we could have we could have had our judgement clouded just by his accomplishments you know i really do think i am going to vote for him again next term but
but i wanted to know exactly everything that happened you know a lot of times maybe i forget
oh sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
experience you know as the great american hero and
yeah
so i am i'm glad that he can't get into office this time without at least addressing a lot of the a lot of the home front issues
and well todd it sounds like
what about libya i have no idea what to say about
yeah i don't know
if you know if you'd asked me the same question about kuwait you know at this early in the game i don't what i would have said then either i don't
now of course the last time i listened to anything was on sunday
and they had still refused the concessions by the security council so
right
i'm bridget
oh really
really
huh
i think we're supposed to talk about magazines
i don't take any do i need to push one first okay hold on
i didn't i said it i called in and it told me to talk about i don't subscribe to any magazines do you
do you really
really so how come you like subscribing to them
so what magazines do you get
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh goodness
uh-huh so you get a well you get a see i'm in college so
i get mostly business magazines so all the magazines i ever see they're just advertising so i don't ever subscribe to them so but that's good though
uh-huh yeah i'm gonna i'm a senior yes i love it
see my parents are from dallas and they started in and they sent it to me and so that's how i got started
when they try and call yeah
yeah i just started so i'm always like now what do i do i'm always like what
i don't
yeah but i didn't know they'd ask me if i subscribed to them i can talk about magazines
hm see i really i mean i don't even i don't even grab mine or even look at them
well i think right now i'd buy bride because i just got engaged so i'd buy that
i know they're huge
i know i think i'd buy like home and gardens and stuff like that yeah i like stuff like that
i used to get like a horse magazines and stuff i used to show horses so yeah
so you see a lot of horse magazines but that was quite a while ago
yeah i used to ride them english uh-huh hunter jumper
so i used to get lots of magazines for that but every since i stopped at that and went to college and i really haven't got any more magazines for that
but those are probably the only two magazines i'd get
uh-huh
you get a lot of them that's great though
that's great though because especially with business though because i know like with business stuff because when they first asked me this i was like well i they're like why do you like articles or
why do you not like magazines i was like because it has so many advertising but business ones don't really and they're really informative
yeah but they're very they're very informative i think that's great
i major in psychology in family studies yeah
i like it a lot
yeah because people are so much nicer yes
i went to birkner high school in richardson
say arlington texas now since i got somebody from arlington virginia one day yeah
oh birmingham
right it's funny how many names have been used all over the country
but
no but i really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones but you know sometimes i just read one about grace kelly i love to read about
real people to me half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories
yeah it happened
really
right
oh really
oh it sounds like fun
wonder if it was by one of those famous writers you know margaret truman daniels writes a lot of those
really sounds like something she would write
yeah i've heard that she's done real you know her books are really interesting and they always sell well
and
yeah brings it to life
i know the some of the british people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty
i know our movie stars
oh right
oh yes
oh i always like those
have you ever read anything by susan howatch
isn't she fabulous
oh once you i don't like to get one of her books because i just live to read i'll skip everything just to get back to the book
oh yeah
she's just i don't know -s she how often does she come out with them i probably have missed the last few since i've been back in school
oh well she can she can turn them out overnight i swear
yeah i've never read a whole one of hers i don't think
and think how rich she is
oh yeah
and then make movies out of some of them or
right
i do too so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers but oh her books are just incredible i don't think they've ever made a movie do you
yes well no i really just thought about it now but there's maybe it's because they take so much in i don't know
um-hum
they're so big they're such you know it would be like another gone with the wind i guess a three hour movie
no it had such a bad press i wasn't too intrigued
um-hum
right
me either do you know anyone that's read it
no i haven't heard of anybody that's read it either but it i think it was on the best-seller list though for a while
so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in america today
yeah that's
a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced
something like five to seven years but he gets five days credit for every day he serves i mean it's like a bonus to go to jail so subsequently a five year sentence means he's going be out in a year
on probation i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to a stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate and when he
uses up all that and spends all that money then he starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing
now see that's a you talk about that's a crime right there
well we don't either in texas
well it certainly is and that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this
as far what goes on with our
criminal system our
-ciary system and everything else it's just it's terrible the way it is right now
yeah as far as steps to reduce crime if it's crimes like we're just been discussing
obviously we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to take them off the streets but i don't think that's gonna happen because just like you said and
our state's a good example your state's a good example and it's just not gonna happen as far as the murderers
and people that commit rape and things like that i'm not sure what's right but i know that it's not right to put him in there and
let him live for years and years and leers years before you do execute him or whatever because it's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him and you know to
i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of tv and i'm sure they have
have a good time in
no it really isn't
it's a big it's a big problem and hopefully something will come out of it
so i don't know
i'm pretty much of a hard person
i believe in capital punishment i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone i mean you know if it's just downright outright
oh
you bet i mean that's the only way to
oh yeah and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to take care of them and all you know it's just unbelievable
can you really
gosh
oh i know see
meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps you know
yes
the drug problems that's another one
oh you do what ages are they
oh my sound like a busy parent
yeah
oh do you and your wife both work
well that's nice i
i don't care too much for day care centers and preschool well you know schools where the children stay all day long
i think if it got much more than that i would start feeling like someone was gonna be left out
yeah
right i don't well i think once my child got to be maybe four years old i might feel a little better about a larger group setting
but up until that time both of my girls had such passive personalities that if they had been around a whole lot of other children i really think they would have been
yeah
no
no
yeah you said that you would like if your wife had to go back to work you probably would prefer that they stayed in a home
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
right
because i babysitters are just really hard to come by especially real good ones and you know ones that don't keep that many children and give them the individual attention that i think they need and that kind of thing
so i don't know i feel real sorry for you know working moms that are really looking hard and trying to do a good job with their kids
wow that's great
oh i know
yeah
yeah oh yeah we feel that way i mean even now it's really hard to make ends meet even with two children so i can imagine with four
but i don't know i worked at a little preschool it was a private one you know like a church sponsored type thing where it was only two days a week tuesday and thursday from like nine till two
and even that i was not totally satisfied with the way the kids were treated
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
oh
yeah
she didn't
so do you have pcs
huh-uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i sort of own a computer we have two pcs at home but neither one do we really own
both are no both of them are sort of work related and
no i actually i'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby and my husband's working at bell labs but he's really from france and these computers actually are from france
it's a three eighty six
ibm pc compatible it's a three eighty six
guess it's twenty five
yeah three eight six twenty five c maybe i don't know no we don't have the cash that's right we decided not to get the cash which is actually another loaner one too that we've picked up
well i actually do some work working at mit and at nist national institute of standards and technology
in washington and then i worked for dragon systems
for a while
well it depends it's very different in the different places
but
i work in the speech field and i do a lot about acoustics phonetics and
looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech and so i do that type of stuff typically
for other people and we use here we use the pcs to do that and mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that
and we don't have too much standard software like i haven't bought
we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all so we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that we use it more for just writing programs when we need to
or
doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing
just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that
neither one has a modem but we have a modem
neither one
right
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
so that was it
oh i didn't hear it
do you hear the beep in the background
oh that's a an ambulance or something going on here i think
in manhattan
yeah i'm at home
uh-huh so it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal i mean because there's a lot of background noise that you know people can hear so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up
yeah and often times that i can't talk on can't do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone conversation
about twenty after four
okay yeah we're eastern
and
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah i've never tried using that i don't know too much about it what about have you did you use commercially available software or
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use
uh-huh
uh-huh do you think you d base is more flexible or allows you to do more or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days
well i yeah i didn't mean compatible i meant comparable my brain is going to mush
and what do you work on at ti
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
right
fun
i agree
yes and i taught for fourteen years
before we moved to texas and the one thing i see is changing is
i was held accountable so much i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children
everything had to be documented and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation
yes
me too
i think so too
they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores that children get on tests now
and teacher competency you know and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best she's always worried whose looking over her shoulder and
that's right
i know
that's right
do you have children in the system
ah
yep are you in plano yep i am too and i have one in ninth grade at clark and one at hendrick this year and he my sixth grader came from an open classroom at matthews
partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something
i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school so he spent all day in this one large open area
so i didn't really care for that it seems like the schools in michigan were much better than they are down here
that was our last tour up in michigan
oh
um-hum
oh wow
yes
yes that's right we heard wonderful things about it till we actually got in the system
probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are
so
as a freshman yep
yeah
my daughter seems to be having a good time she was absent with strep throat the last three days and i ran over and picked up her report card and she did very good so
and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of homework i would expect
for a freshman to have she's not bogged down but yet she has some every night
yes you always hear how good now my son's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what he's going to bring home so i don't
have
are you a grandparent or you just have never had children
oh well this is kind of hard topic for you then isn't it
you're what
and they were all into little league and athletics and fact we had two
state wrestling champions
they were just busy and we just spent time with them i mean with five boys you're just following one or the other all the time
uh-huh
and one girl
you what
yeah
right and then we have one in chicago he's an airline pilot and then one in cleveland that's a doctor
pardon
american
oh my goodness
well how long has he flown for them
well our son's been with them about eight i would maybe not six maybe six but he's a captain now so
we're happy with that
he does he says and to think they even pay me for it
uh-huh
yeah well our son that's a doctor has his pilot's license too but just it's a small craft
oh and you don't have children do you
oh
well sometimes that happens and sometimes you fill your life with other things so
oh do you do you live on a little farm then
oh
oh that
oh my goodness you must be talented
oh
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh
football game at the holiday bowl
you probably don't follow that
oh it's on espn
oh uh-huh oh
oh my goodness
oh you're really rural
well we we're about sixty miles north of salt lake city so have you ever been there
oh
oh
well we better get back to the subject did
uh-huh
i think a lot of children do nowadays our with the with the athletics and the well they all took music lessons
and so with everything that they were involved in the especially our high school kids didn't have time for tv
into what
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i do too yeah i'm a garth brooks fan
oh actually i'm from bronx new york that's as a new york as you can get
well actually i'm in long island now but bronx is one of the five boroughs that make up new york city and new york city is what most people think of as new york but anyway
oh that's one thing i just can't stand and i think
you know there's not much rock and roll anymore there's a lot of head banging music and the country has a nice beat and some nice words and it's mellow
well i you know i substitute teach in my local school district and the high school had country music day
they have this big hallway where the kids can hang out after they've had their lunch
and there was a lady with cowboy boots and she there was a fellow with a whole black outfit on a little scarf around his neck and cowboy boots
and they had a you know one of these we call them ghetto blasters one of those big you know music boxes going with some country western stuff and they were like kidding around with the teenagers trying to get them on the dance floor
and the dancing wasn't all that easy there's a lot of steps to it and a couple the kids were joining in some of them felt totally foolish but yeah it's going around
i don't know if it's getting to the youth though
ah
oh well you know it's something you can't fake the way you could just wiggle to rock and roll you really do know the steps though
yeah
is there any other kind of music you like
yeah well the top forty kind of stuff is a i work out in the gym and we listen to that because you need a driving beat to keep you moving i think
i guess i'm thinking of the old top forties i'm thinking of the rolling stones you know
right
well i have a fourteen year old son and he's playing stuff by who is it
no not guns and roses he's in the background saying guns and roses no not that
yeah they seem to be enjoying it
do you play any instruments
oh do you like classical
i like blues yeah i like some of that
well i before i was married i used to play a lot of sports
fulfilling my obligations so i haven't done a lot of exercise on purpose what about you
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's good
uh-huh
do you work out on like is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
oh i bet
um-hum
um-hum
hum
well
well that's good
so are you
well i like i am undisciplined in the sense that i can't just go and do exercise
play tennis and play racquetball i like to get exercise when i'm playing a game of some sort and so that's always been the way that i have kept myself in the shape that i was satisfied with at least
and then i have given that up but i would really like to start that again because i am now you know not in a position that i like myself i don't feel
good and i get you know when you get out of shape and you don't if you're easily tired
i mean i have so many chores and so many obligations every day for to add another obligation would make me feel stressed
and i wouldn't enjoy it but if i have something some team sport or some activity then it's kind of like having fun playing and then you then you get some of the
good exercise and some of the desired results but you you're doing it for fun
but i really admire people who can go and work out and
um-hum
uh-huh
well that's nice
um-hum
yes
it is kind
it is family and it's fun it's a fun thing and kids enjoy that and
and all and also the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation
you know hot jacuzzis or whatever they have that kind of is kind of makes it fun and stuff you know you can relax that way afterwards and things
but well i guess it's getting late
well
yeah i bought one i went to the i bought the low impact first i thought shouldn't out of the blue just jump in
so but i haven't done it but i'm going to try it well you have a good night we'll see you bye-bye
i don't know does your do you have recycling in atlanta
uh-huh do you have to do you have to do the sorting or do they do the sorting for you
um-hum into the different box
that's not real
that's not real popular with the states around us because
but
i think that well i do some recycling like i save my bottles and things like that but i don't think i do as much i think i could do more
and i
there's a big problem here with like landfills
like
they the landfills are just like filling up with stuff
and i think that if they were to recycle if i were to i guess if there was like some kind of a program i would do it just so that we could save the space in those things
i was
let's see he made he made a lot of money working because like in the states like massachusetts and vermont and all the states around new hampshire they put in this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there
that's where it's like every can is stamped with like a nickel return on it
and it's like you have to like if you can turn the can in to any store and they have to pay you a nickel for it
but what happens is that then all these cans come running you know some stores get more cans than they sell and they have a big problem with that but
the law says that if they sell they have to collect
but anyway this guy like all the like the beer distributors were having like the biggest problem and
he
he actually like made a business that just went around from like distributor to distributor
collecting like all the cans and he said like some things like the aluminum cans
they could make money on because aluminum can be they can just throw that back into the pot
and that just gets melted back up and that's not a problem but like the plastic ones you like you were saying
they lost like big money on because they can't they can't reuse the some plastics can be reused but most plastics can't be remelded remolded or melted into other things
and it just becomes more of a pain than it's worth
but i don't know i wonder you know
should they be making things that like just can't be reused
it kind of i don't i don't and well
should i be buying things that can't be reused
i
do you did you ever see those big old coke bottles you know the glass ones that were like they were kind of green
at what point in time did it get to be
at what you know i didn't i thought they were great but at what point in time did it get to be worse
huh
yeah i pushed a an auto dial so do y'all have a family budget
yeah we a couple of years ago took a class that was offered was a guy at our church called mastering your money by ron blue
you've heard of him it's been really good we've we're on a monthly budget and pretty much we designed our own
ideas of you know these are some set things that we know we're gonna spend and
the rest we have in categories but for the most part it's been somewhat discretionary
the like right now a and the next month will probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer and so
we may spend a little more there and a little less in another area
so but it's worked really well we've been able to save
you know what we've wanted to save and pretty much been able to do what we've wanted to do and we have some long term goals that we want to do
i keep the books and i'm the one that writes all the all the bills and stuff and pretty much i just know what i have to spend no you may not
systems and stuff but i don't find that works real well for me
and we also we have a category of short term goals that we put aside money each month and if we want to like right now we're getting ready to
put up a fence and that will come out of there it's money that we haven't budgeted for
you know things you know things like that and then
that's where it will come from and if we don't have the money in there we have to wait until it's you know up to where we where it needs to be
i i'm sorry i didn't hear you
yeah
well he recommends that you don't or he recommends that you get them down we we've never been real big credit card users and we always pay it off
every month if we use them we're not real big cash carriers so occasionally we will spend or we will you know put a meal on it or
where we pay it off at the end of the month so we don't put just a whole lot on there we don't use them just real often except i do use my gas i keep track of my gas on my credit cards
because that either you're not financed charged on there and you don't and you don't you don't need to have cash there and they don't now you can get it at you know cash is the same price as credit
so are you married
which will suck up your money real quick
um-hum
okay pat can you tell me
actually they want what everyday occurrences are
right or do you have
yeah
that's a point
actually
using credit cards the information that the person that you give it to
you don't have to put your phone number down
some people ask you for it but you're not required to give that information
oh very few up here yeah they just don't they don't ask for a driver's license
yeah see my
yeah my checks are it's just my wife
and my name no address
so it's just names on the check so no one can you know i mean they can i suppose with a little leg work if they wanted to
but the average person's not going to do that anyhow
okay
oh okay that's yeah i
i've read articles about that but people have to be pretty gullible either that or especially widows
old people
right
and some people some of the older people today their husband's handled all the finances so now they find themselves left out in the cold and they're really not savvy as far as it comes to handling their own personal affairs
yeah
i'm still not convinced that
they can get you if you're if you're aware first of all you never should give your credit card numbers over the phone to anyone
which is which is kind of basic
they people may generate lists are if you subscribe to a magazine i guess they sell lists of names to other people but they'll send you junk mail usually
and you can stop that easy enough just go to the post office and just have your name taken off
yes i have
no they did not
right
yeah but that's
isn't doesn't corporate have a didn't they put a stop on that
yeah right
yes they do exist and if someone wants to really find out about you i suppose if they wanted to go to all that trouble they could
right
yeah you could do that if you really wanted to
yeah
right yeah
yeah
yeah
that's and you can do that anyone can do anything that's public record whether it's divorce or anything like that whether you purchase a home that's all that's all public record
what they do with that information people are really
go out and do it i suppose somebody does the leg work and they and they generate a list
and
right
yeah we had we've got a an account at sears roebuck
and we had moved from one town to another town and they've got our address listed now with double towns in it and i've tried and tried and tried to get it off but you just can't get it so
since then we've gotten solicitations from other people listing both towns so i know damn well that sears has sold their list of names out to somebody else
but there isn't anything you can do about that
right some of the some of the charities now will do that if you chose choose not to have your name
put on a list and i do that you know we have our charities that we give to and then we say yes no just don't
because you do it and then you're on everybody's charity list
that's right that's exactly right most of the funds that a lot of these organizations collect
go to fund the organization i mean very
little of the funds get out to do anything worthwhile
it all started with the government
the government started keeping tabs on you and whether they
those list that internal revenue has whether they leak out to the public or not i'm really not sure maybe in some cases they have in the past
once a list is out it's out forever
yeah
but the bulk of it probably
ninety seven to ninety eight percent of all those lists are going just for solicitations some people maybe are using them for ulterior motives i'm not really sure
but the bulk of them is and it's junk mail and you can you can you can get off those junk mail lists you just tell the post office
so that will limit that amount of stuff
i read i read and article where this man
sent to everything they could possibly get and he was getting
reams and reams of paper all kinds of periodicals and magazines and letters and notifications and what he was doing with them he was storing them up and he was using them for fuel
during the winter time
what i do is on all the credit card solicitations
if they have a return envelope with it i write across the face of it no thank you your rates are too high and i mail it back to them
because now they have to pay the postage so now it's costing them something to do that
they don't
oh up here they do well they're still doing it well it's just like up here we don't there's very few times i've had to show my driver's license for to use a credit card
and i'm not sure why
you know why it's so prevalent down there and
maybe it will catch up here
yeah we've got the
we've got the ones you just stick your card in the pump
yeah so whatever you whatever brand that you buy you just drive up to the pump you put your credit card in it and then it says you know please commence pumping and then when you pump then when you're through
you put the nozzle back and it says do you want a receipt and if you can push yes if you want one and if you don't want one you push no
okay do you have any children
um-hum i don't any children so i'm gonna have difficulty with this topic but what kind of things do you and your family do
hm
um-hum
hm then your kind of family is probably pretty rare now a days i don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that that's great
yeah
um-hum that's great
i think a lot of families now for they probably don't spend enough time together you know whether they're
whether the parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together and i think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed
just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing and because that i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot and the communication helps you build on your
helps just build your family
um-hum
yeah that's pretty to me that's pretty rare
i think that whenever i do have children i'll i'm gonna try as hard as i can
to see that we spend a lot of time together you know maybe just even if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their own thing all the time
and you know that's good sometimes because you need to you know get away but i don't think you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of losing your the family unit
um-hum
yeah and as i understand it i don't know i haven't experienced it but you know kids these days are growing up so much faster
um-hum yeah so
do you think that you do you think that your family's pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter
um-hum
what do you think is the key to just bringing the american family back together what kinds of things do you think can
yeah that's true that's
hm
right
i think that's the first thing a lot of people do and i know i'm guilty of it like i came in from work today first thing i did was turn the tv on because i taped the stories from earlier today
and i like to watch them but i think that's that is a big problem television it's too static you know it's something that you can do but you there's no thinking involved no motion
you know and i think i think that's another reason why people are
you know people aren't doing anything just sitting around you know no thinking involved and now i think i think people are trying to get out of that at least and that you know there's a lot of
it's becoming really health conscious
and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that
and that's probably good you know if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that also helps that's also something you know family oriented that everyone can do
hm
hum-um
how old is she
well she has
yeah
you still have a lot of time before she gets
hm
okay well it was very nice talking to you
okay bye-bye
um-hum
i've never actually got to plan one but i've came to several back here in tennessee that were planned long distance with people you know because my immediate family is like five states
and we had a big dinner today about thirty people and
well the birthday was today and tomorrow one of our nephew's one of my nephew's is getting married so
a lot of people came from well to florida virginia and texas and tennessee here for that for both occasions
so it's been
yeah
i i'm actually one of sixteen kids so and only nine of those kids belong to my mother
well forever it's been in my memory yeah
the last time we had a legitimate family reunion one of the sisters couldn't make it so
everybody had pictures of everybody together but her
so today we
it's kind of like your family sometimes it's just funerals and special occasions but the last family reunion was in eighty five and i'd like to see another one get going
i didn't get to attend because i was in the process of moving to texas over that same weekend and but they said you know it was a blast and they sent me pictures
it was you know people we grew up with and people came from all over the place to get back for that one
yeah i would love to i mean i just love to you know stories about the kids i grew up with but i'd like to see i'd still like to see them yeah
well at the time you know all i could do was tell them hey well sam's moving from new mexico to texas and this that and the other so
yeah
yeah
um-hum
they planned it for several years and actually had a book made of peoples stories and where people went and photographs that went back about two hundred years and of course
it was no it each family that lived in
well how do you feel about putting an elderly family member in a nursing home
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah oh i agree i it's a tough issue i feel like each case probably has to be evaluated individually i feel
i feel like as families you know we need to take care of the older ones in our families
and yet i understand well we may be facing that with my grandmother she is living near my parents out in california
and they this year they moved her into a retirement apartment complex so she's got part time care
but as soon as she needs round the clock care then she's not allowed to live there anymore and so we'll have to face the issue of whether she moves in with my mother or they put her into a nursing home and
it's difficult because i know my mother feels really torn about it she doesn't want to
to put her in a place where she's gonna be unhappy lonely or where there's bad care and sometimes you just don't know what the place is like
i mean you really need to get recommendations i guess from others and
and yet it's a real burden to her to have to be there all the time or else you know or else like you said you have to hire someone to be in the home it's a tough issue
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
i guess i would want to visit the place quite a bit before or something and talk to the staff see what their attitudes are talk to some of the people that live there and see how they feel about being there
because i've been in different nursing homes where i've sensed different atmospheres you know often it's been negative where the
and i know that partly it can be the attitude of the person if they feel neglected by their family or whatever or they just feel ready to die and you know tired of feeling not feeling good all the time
then they're not gonna feel too good but then i've been to other places where you know the people have told me this is a really good place the people here really care about us so
yeah
yeah
yeah well no but all the years that i've been alive she has for the last thirty years or so
it's central california
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well this is fresno uh-huh
um-hum
okay so do you own a pc
but you have one at work
and i don't i don't have one but i have to use them like during especially during my undergrad
you use like your first couple of years you use personal computers because you know the software you know like it's easier for you to go and run a program you know through the disk
because the grader can do it at home then as the you know as you go up higher like in your senior level you're doing projects which are so big and you have to have so many people sharing the same data
that you can't use personal computers so you have to use you know a main frame
oh okay
but does it have like a disk drive
oh okay because the ones that we use you know are like unix base systems and so they don't have a disk drive you know so you can't the only way that you can do it is through a modem
and you know you just
do it that way but that's the only way that you can get to through to the system you can't store it anywhere
oh okay
and then you also have to do all your grading on the pc
oh okay
okay
yeah
well for us it's you know it's like for doing like you know like resumes
and presentations we use like for example a macintosh which is a lot easier for graphics than the than you know the ibm pc's or anything compatible with that
due to the fact that well you know i haven't tested the ps two yet but i don't know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than the old one the old one you had to go pick a line
use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start and where you know with the mouse you do it you know like a hundred times faster
and you also get you know when you see it on the macintosh with you know the one i have that doesn't have any color you can look at it and that's the way it's going to print out
and especially if you have a laser printer it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen
and so
with you know with the ibm what would happen is since the software that i had was it was basically you know you only see part of the page
and so the whole page you never can actually see it you just draw it and they have to zoom out and zoom in and you know it's like every time that you have to do something is it's really a pain
and also you know it's like for presentations it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a pc it can be easily represented on a on a pc you know like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this all these numbers
and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not you know but with a with a new system i can calculate everything so fast you know like for spread sheets
you can see what the trend is over the years
yeah that
that i had a i had a program due and one window i had the program and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error
instead of saying where did i make the error you know go back and forth and you know you always you know the old ones you had to go out of your program load up
well load up the program again in this case after you load it up change it hope that's right
get out of that run the program run as long as it took and then go back and see if that worked or not but with windows you can have the program and say it messed up in line fifty four
so you take a look at line fifty four you take a look at the output at the same time
and you can see that where it messed up because you know it's like in the old computers the ones that we're using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout
every time that you ran your program you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background
did you learn it in computer science
and when was this
oh okay
yeah i know because all i know is that when i came here in eighty seven
they still had it was the last year to put all your punch cards in
you can get a hard copy of it and that's about it
so but i mean the price of computers has gone down they said that if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since you know it started
they said that cars would cost two dollars and they would run forever
so i mean it's like you know the joke with the yugo you know it's like yeah you know like when your car runs out of gas just throw it away
and that that's the way it would be you know it's like
yeah i think i'll buy a new car today you know so yeah but i mean the price has really gone down i mean ibm which
an ibm pc in like in nineteen eighty one it would cost you five thousand dollars
and now you can get it you know like for one thousand dollars because you know because of the parts basically you know what
yeah
the parts and the labor is what they're charging you they're not charging you know over pricing it because it's like if we sell it for less you know it's like we're losing money you know it's like we want to sell it to break even at least
and i think they stopped producing the ibm pc
and the pc junior was a total failure
but over the past years ibm has been producing like every two years they bring out a whole new system you know like the p c b x t d a t and the ps one ps two things you know and so
it's just that you have to always compete and macintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools
because of their you know you can work with it a lot easier
so that's what they're trying to do oh well
i'll leave you back to your work and have a good lunch all right bye
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
oh
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
although plans to go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to the sixties
if
some if it were possible to market some form of space technology you know to
to make it equitable it might severely help the economy you know in the in the
um-hum
exactly
um-hum
um-hum
right yeah it seems like there's so you're talking about positive side effects then okay i understand
sure that makes a lot of sense
um-hum
yeah
yeah
right exactly
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
exactly
least nothing
yeah
right now we're done
yeah i think you're right
i would too i'd it was it john denver that tried to buy his way on to the space
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
huh
some other car had
well isn't that something well oh sure
right
well i do i do some of my own repairs yes i do i have learned to do this
that my husband drives sports cars he races them as a hobby
yes and he said you need to know how to do all this stuff so i do change my own oil
most in fact i have changed out a whole engine in one of sons' trucks
yes i took the whole thing out and i fixed it but i think it's really important to know these things if you can
but now if i could talk him into doing this i'll let him do it i've told him i've learned how but
no i don't think i wanna work on too many people's cars that's hard work i think they earn their money i do
right
yes it does now i don't think i will be able to work on you know too cars much longer because they are sophisticated and i just can't fool with these computers and things that they have in it that
the proper tools right that's
but it
oh well that's nice
uh-huh well that is really good but i can't think of any offhand problems we have really had lately you know that we've had to fix
the one thing we have problem with is our electricals anything that goes electrical wrong with the cars we don't even try to fool with those ourselves
and those
to me they're very difficult to locate the problem if you
well right they can do that with the new ones uh-huh with these newer cars you can do that and
but other than that the
the oil changes and the gases
water and antifreeze i do keep that in there
yeah have you ever changed a windshield wiper
yeah
oh well good what kind is it
uh-huh well good
okay we have we have a family reunion every summer and we different sides of the family take turns on planning it sending out the invitations and
and then the activities that we have we kind of get together and have a luncheon or a lunch or a cookout or barbecue or whatever
and get to know so all the cousins get to know each other and
we really enjoy our family get togethers and family reunions so to speak
are you able to do that
oh okay
oh wow
um-hum
um-hum
well that's really great and they're able to come from long distances like that we have children in ohio and
texas and germany and illinois and all over but
they get to some of them but this is the ones that live in utah and but it it's sure great those family reunions are really something but
at
go up into the canyon and camp out for over the weekend and it we
have a bonfire and sit around and in the evening and around the pine in the pine trees in the mountains and
the atmosphere's just really nice and then the kids get to play with each other and it it's a super thing
um-hum
uh-huh
we have there's probably about
our own family there is we had six children but we have my wife's side of the family is the one that we go up to
idaho up in the canyon and there's probably about forty people there
and total and then we do have another get together at christmas time on my side of the family and this last one we had eighty five people to that one
we have i had five four brothers and one sister
and then on my wife's side of the family she had four sisters and a brother
and so we're kind of from large families and then they're all married and all have their children and they come and so it's really quite a get together we've been doing this up in idaho in the summer in the camp out for
we're thirty nine years every summer we've done this and we do it the second week in july between the fourth of july and the twenty fourth of july which is a holiday here in utah
it's when the pioneers came into utah and settled utah brigham young came in on the twenty fourth of july
and when they came across they came from the east in the covered wagons and or started the settlement of salt lake city
so
yeah they have we have a large parade in salt lake city it's probably the one of the biggest parades in the country it goes for about three or four hours
and of course it's a state holiday
and so we
we have ours between that and the week between those the fourth and twenty fourth and
so every year we know
i guess we're supposed to talk about music
and let me go ahead and push one here
do you are you a musician yourself
uh-huh
uh-huh where do you sing in a choir or a choral group
uh-huh what kind of singing do you like to do
yeah uh-huh are you are have you have you been singing a long time or have you studied uh-huh
right
oh really
oh great did you do that in texas or somewhere else
oh whereabouts
so i enjoy just the chorals singing a lot as well are you a soprano alto or
a soprano yeah so am i do you and what kind of music do you like to sing you were saying you had classical training do you have a particular composer that you like or a particular type
uh-huh
i've been listening to some advertisements for madam butterfly and i'm wondering if you if you have ever done anything like that have you ever done any if you had done madam butterfly
yes
uh-huh yes uh-huh
madam butterfly was in dallas it's been two or three years ago now and then i went to see that and it was really wonderful it was particularly well the acting was particularly nice i thought and
so it was quite popular you don't play an instrument so ah
yeah that i think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does you know some other kind of instrument i think piano is always good background beginner
i played piano all through well i guess from the time i was five until i graduated from college and then i was a piano teacher for a while my husband was in graduate school so
one of them turned into a violinist and the other one is the boy is guitar and percussion so
but the i think that the piano background is very useful and i'm sure that it for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself just for practicing and so on
uh-huh do you have any other kind of music that you like
um-hum
i have a i used to work with a fellow who had although this was a computer company he had his phd in musical i guess it was in composition actually from university of north texas and
it may be country it might be classical it might be rock you know it was just he said that just about what you said that he just liked all kinds of music and
that was that was neat for me to hear that somebody is
yeah
do you have any plans to do anything with your music in the near future or
um-hum
yeah
i know that there are if you're interested in choral singing i'm not sure where you are in texas but i do know that some communities have
community choruses and that's often a good way to get back into it again it's not terribly demanding you might have to audition but that probably wouldn't be a problem but
well that's one reason why i have enjoyed my choir so much is that not only do we sing wonderful music but we've gotten to know each other quite well
in on a social level and i think we sing better because of that i think you know i think we sing more like
so whereabouts in texas are you if i could ask
flower mound okay well i'm in plano so we're just not too far apart actually
are do you have a family
uh-huh i was wondering if your if your spouse or if you know if you had other musical people in your family
if you have other people in your family who are also musical
uh-huh
do you come by it naturally was your were your parents that musical yeah that often is the case
well i've enjoyed talking with you becky and maybe we'll talk again uh-huh bye-bye
do you want to give a start on it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-hum
oh definitely
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
in clarion county and
we really didn't have things like that going on that we you know ran into
so we kind of i guess when i think of social changes i think more of
visiting habits of families and such
and today you know people they do visit but it's not quite the same as what it was say twenty years ago thirty years ago
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
well they're so spread out i think has a lot to do with it
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
that's right yeah
the majority yeah uh-huh
you don't really care to go out and visit as much
and
uh-huh
uh-huh
no huh-uh they don't do as much
uh-huh
you have to make arrangements or have an invitation or
yeah
well that could be part of it i don't know for sure what it is i know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance so
we really don't have that even we don't yeah
oh really
oh that's pretty good yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well apparently there must be work available
for those that are
uh-huh because around here there's really nothing for the young people no good i mean there's jobs there's minimum wage jobs but to make a good living there really around here there just isn't too much
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
tried to think of some other things and i couldn't really
that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
they'd rather get their life started first before uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well even to get school finished i think a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in because a marriage takes a lot of
uh-huh
right
yeah i know my daughter that lives in pittsburgh she has two little boys and they they've been in day care since you know one's four and one's one
and
uh-huh
that's right yeah
uh-huh yes uh-huh
that's right yeah
so
but the others i'm too far away to help them out at all
well i have a son and daughter that live in pittsburgh one in maryland and one in connecticut a son in connecticut
no but like connecticut takes eight hours to drive home and it's too far to you know really go too often
pittsburgh's not quite so bad it's just a couple hours
maryland maybe five hour drive
that's
oh are you really
do you stay overnight on the way or you
you're young how old are you
uh-huh
it's work to get there yeah huh
uh-huh now my son they flew he rebuilt a aranca chief airplane and they flew down last weekend they came down in it
and it still took a long time because it's not a fast it's not a high-speed airplane
but they enjoyed in thoroughly
so
i'm not sure but you have to change phones you have to call from another a different
so what is your why do you think people don't vote in the elections
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i think i think apathy is real big thing i mean just in the fact that you don't think you're going to have anything done i to me it's really hard to find
any information on the candidates i mean i voted yesterday and
half the people you know you really have to hunt to get information on them and you know as far as the local things go and if you know if you don't know them then
really
yeah
that's a good idea
yeah
huh-uh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i that's i don't know what it was that we had that i had yesterday got it from someone in our church that it asked
it went all the way well it went to some of our constables but mainly it was in the dallas area not in the plano area
but it asked it had all sorts of questions about economics education and
family and
yeah but it had other things like do you would you support
i know one that kind of stuck out in my mind was would you support a two thousand dollar
tax credit for women that stay you know at home and so it had kind of a variety of
of questions and it probably had twenty or thirty questions on it
it was really you know that was really good and helpful and it you know it had them you know if they could support oppose or you know be undecided about it
yeah it was it was it was i thought it was really good but you know it course it doesn't go through all the candidates and some of them you know you think well this guy's this guy won't have any won't have any
say so about any of this anyway but it's kind of good to know their opinions anyway they you know run for a different kind of office so i think once you're in politics you probably stay in politics i would think
yeah
uh-huh and that may have been who had done it i'm i don't remember
i
okay jim can you tell me a little bit about your opinions on capital punishment
yeah
well you've got a point there but do you think one appeal is too stringent
okay
now what do you think about the death penalty itself do you think that we should have a death penalty
now i work in massachusetts but i live in rhode island so the legislature just come out and said that because of what with
treating the prisoners so-called brutally because the state prison's overcrowded we have to release them
so they took the offenders with the minor crimes and they let them go they didn't have to serve the rest of their term and which is absolutely incredible
i think number one my opinion is that the judges are too lenient
but yet you get some of the jury trials and it comes down to the nitty gritty when people are ready to condemn a person
they always kind of forgive him a little bit nobody wants to put the finger on somebody and say well that's it you know we're going to kill you
so it's got to be up to the judges i think we need we have to put into place judges that are stricter than the ones that are in there now
and the other thing is i'm not sure about texas but like in rhode island if someone breaks into your home
you have to do your utmost to leave so you can't cause a confrontation with that person you can't shoot him you can't do anything with him i'm not sure what texas is
yeah it's
yeah and ours
yeah and see in our case it's you have to you have to exit you have to leave and if you have to leave your home to get away from this individual that's what you should do
so
what choice have you got
you know as far as far as
our laws go up here
yeah you're
you're fading away jim
huh
that doesn't make any
right
right
and so he was under the influence of narcotics at that time when the act was performed but he knows he's going to go back and do the same thing over again
you know when he's straight so so-called
so people like that any one i believe you if you murder someone i believe in an eye for an eye
and i think probably
maybe the majority of the people do at least the people that i talk to
you go out there and you kill somebody you rob a gas station or a drug store and you shoot somebody
you deserve to be killed also
right
right you're subject to one appeal i kind of don't agree with you on that i think probably you should have at least two appeals
yeah
because they can't if they if they tape something they can't they can't bring it into the court as evidence
and they know
they just had this i don't know if it's been in your newspapers but the guy that got out of prison here to go to a mafia swearing in ceremony
and they got
somebody and i'm not sure who it was what law enforcement agency
they got a movable bug a court order for a movable bug which means that you can take it any place and put it any where
and now they're contesting that movable bug because they didn't state that they were going to put it in this particular home where this meeting took place so there's a technicality there but they know outright
that these people are murderers and whatever else you got and yet they're not going to let that evidence in you know as admissible evidence in court
so that has to be looked at too i don't know who they're protecting they're not protecting the innocent that's for sure
that's true that's true self-preservation of the species i guess right
well the
you're kidding
because of because of what because of overcrowding or
huh
now the pendulum's going to swing
more and more people
yeah because you look at the statistics now and i'm sure it's in your newspapers just like it is in ours that
every major city now the increase of crime is escalating i mean there are more look at the look at the people there are being shot now
i mean every day there's dozens of dozens of people across the nation they just get blown away for no reason you know stray bullets or
california they were going out there and they were shooting and they get these guys and they don't do anything with them so i kind of i kind of agree with you i'm kind of you still in the in the prison system
how do you like it
well
that's incredible
do you carry a firearm in when you're in there
nothing
not even a billy club or
huh
what's the purpose of that so they can't take it
yeah well i don't know so you going to make a career out of it
oh okay is it was it civil service
well good afternoon to you mary first let me ask you what's the weather like up there to begin with
that sounds more like our winter weather down here
well you know i bet that's what we that storm we had last night
oh we had a frog strangler go sweeping through here yesterday and last night and we're expecting another one tonight
oh i mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street
uh-huh
well it's probably on its way up there it was heading north
well it was nice today
in between the thunder showers yes
well you know what they say about the weather here in texas
if you if you don't like it wait five minutes it'll change
uh-huh
uh-huh well tell me is it normally that cold up there in the in the spring
you're kidding
you are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open
um-hum
oh mother macree
no i should say not
well i sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had
i hope it doesn't reach you up there
well i let's hope it well if it's the same as what we had at least it'll be warmer
yeah oh boy the that whew that would be tear disastrous if you had that rain storm and freezing weather
oh
uh-huh
oh yes
uh-huh well i heard on the news this morning that
one of our local schools lost the roof of their gymnasium
and they suspected may have been a tornado
but thank god for small favors the
what do they call them the
marching band or something
had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before
oh and how
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah well during the winter yes we do we've had
well past four or five years i guess at least one day
during the year when just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain
and of course people down here they just don't know how to handle themselves and
oh not only that but we're don't have the equipment to handle it either
they go out there and the well all you can do with freezing rain of course is spread sand on the ice
and but you know we don't even have vehicles that will do that they have to get a truck of sand and four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand
well and then to make matters worse it destroys your vehicles too
yeah they well we they do that down here too they mix the salt in with the sand
yes uh-huh
i've no i'm a dog lover myself
yeah i guess it would be
oh
oh wasn't that nice of him
i have a chowperd myself
a chowperd
well she's part chow and part shepherd
uh-huh but she's the best
the best of both breeds
well june is medium sized but she is scared to death of thunder storms
uh-huh
oh
oh that must be nice
uh-huh
well good
no well now you know it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in miami beach somewhere
or better yet down around saint petersburg florida
uh-huh that's what i call home
i lived there for ten years
uh-huh
yep well i lived there in the seventies
and i love it i have two sons still living down there
oh uh-huh
well that's why i was suggesting that saint petersburg is got to be the finest weather in the world
oh i loved it down there
course you could tell always tell which were the natives
and which ones were the snowbirds
yeah the snowbirds were the
okay the topic that we have victoria again as i mentioned was
what do you feel is wrong with our public school system and i guess
if i were to look at with four grown children and having been all four of them through public schools and colleges
i guess the public school system i would have to say is that
we probably need to pay our teachers a little bit more
we need to we need to probably
try to get more one on one with the teachers and the and the students if we could
and the other thing was we need to really to tighten up our discipline in schools because they run here in new england i'm not sure about the rest of the country but i know the schools are almost running rampant up here
and it's too bad because there are you know serious drinking problems with real
you know young kids i'm talking kids that are nine ten eleven twelve years old
drug problems
uh-huh
yeah i lived i lived that's just outside of washington i lived in fairfax county that was really a nice area down there and
my i had the same situation here my kids were we bought them up and put them in the public schools here in rhode island and
they were not too bad and this was going back like ten years i guess
ten years ago they were not too bad at that time
and i was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to move from rhode island to texas with ti with my job
and i worked there in the southwest for ten almost ten or eleven years and the kids got a my kids got a much better education in texas simply because they had the opportunity to have more one on one
relationships with the with the facility okay and that helped like especially one of my sons he was he could learn but he really had to work at learning if that makes sense to you
and again like you say there was and you are still a student and there's so much more you could have learned and
but i don't know i think discipline i guess if i were to look at one thing we've lost
well kids used to have a respect for the teacher i guess at one time but i think we've kind of lost that in out school system and i'm not really sure how to get it back i say discipline and that might be the wrong choice of words but it
oh yeah it's so it it's so hard and it's so hard to compete and that's not one of the things that's gonna make the people like yourself who are just graduating from colleges you know or out across the country
wanna go jumping into a an education field when the when there's you can almost double your pay in almost any other field you know for as a as a entry level
and i am not saying that we should give them the world either but i think we should pay them a little more money
they say a hundred and eighty days a year is all they work and i don't really believe that i think it's a lot more than that
i can see the teacher's point too where at three o'clock or four o'clock they want to go home and not worry about kids so but if they had probably some renumeration to help them say you know maybe i'll give this kid a little extra help or something
in the long run i think it would really be worth while
what is your major in school that your ah super that sounds good and you're finishing up this year huh
well that's great i wish you all the best in your future in your endeavors out there in what ever you are doing and it's good to talk to a student rather than
most of the folk i've talked to are industrial people like my self that have been in the work force for a number of years and it's ah it's refreshing to talk to ah to some of you younger folks and get your ideas and thing you know and see how you feel about things
well i don't know what else we can do about this school situation victoria and if there's anything else you'd like to add
you have a nice day and i'm going to say good bye for now and if you're ever up rhode island way around ti look me up it's ray smith at ti in albrough massachusetts
have a nice one victoria and good luck in your future bye
it seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution
and i can very clearly remember ten years ago i was just beginning to explore computerizing my office
and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful and we did end up with ibm pcs which i now would not have chosen but that was before the macintosh
and twenty years ago i was in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter
so i would say that's one of the largest changes at least in my life
uh-huh
um-hum
right
yeah thirty years ago i had a college job working as a programmer
well very possibly i'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before
certainly in the last thirty i would say there have been significant changes even the change from black and white to color television thirty years ago i guess there were color tvs but i sure didn't have access to one
and by twenty years ago practically everybody had a color tv and now i think they're as almost as many well there are more tvs than households so
it's close to getting one tv per person they say
um-hum
yeah certainly ten years ago vcrs were just coming on the market so that's made a significant difference in the way i watch television for instance because now
i almost never watch a tv program when it's on
i tape it and then watch it when it's convenient and that way i don't have to worry about being interrupted i can just put it on pause
right yeah
um-hum
yes you can watch a program in forty five minutes instead of an hour
you skip the commercials
wasn't the decline so much i think they just said the changes in social changes in the united states
how was life different ten twenty or thirty years ago
so
yes
yeah that's another one yeah car phones is a good point and cellular phones of all types and beepers ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center and i had to carry a beeper around and they were
kind of bulky and all they did was just make a beep noise and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call
these days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils
and they fit in your shirt pocket and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a phone number to respond to and
yeah those are pretty neat and they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off in a theatre or something and you can still get your messages
i haven't the slightest idea i was just thinking though about a huge social change in the last ten years is aids
it was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago i know that because i was writing a paper about it
i was writing a journal article
and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything there was a suspicion that it was a virus but nobody had identified it and they were really just going on epidemiological
guesswork because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like hepatitis and then
from the spread pattern of hepatitis they could work backwards to the transmission by blood and semen and then i
well i was i was in english as a matter of fact and medieval studies
but i went to work as an editor and writer
so ten years ago i was working in the medical center publishing a journal
and let's see twenty years ago i guess we're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the
the sex revolution where after the pill and
freed people up from worries about illegitimate pregnancy and
i guess in the seventies is the time when that was supposed to have exploded thirty years ago there was no pill
yep
i do i really do i have
four kids in college right now children and stepchildren
and i know that the expectation for them was to have sex and much earlier than the expectation when i was in college
in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping with their boyfriends
but they certainly didn't expect everybody to and it was really only acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in the relatively near future
and i certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure
nowadays
and i guess the answer is stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to happen in twenty years
i certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what my kids were likely to be like course one of them was just a an
a brand new baby twenty years ago so i sure wouldn't have been able to predict
for him
yeah
electronic mail
i just got on that this past about a year ago and that's made a difference in the way i do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things
even when they're on another continent
yeah and even you know that reminds me federal express was around ten years ago but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency
and nowadays people use fed ex all the time
people do seem to travel more it's much more common for people even teenagers to be going to europe and south america and asia
i was
almost thirty before i got off this continent
and both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school
um-hum
yeah
have you had to put anyone in a nursing home
yeah twenty four hours
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah that would seem like that would be more expensive than a
nursing home wouldn't it
oh and the nurse at home isn't oh okay i got you
yeah i didn't know that
now well my brother in law was working with
in one for a little bit and he just he couldn't handle the things he had to do
you know you know cleaning up after men and women using the restroom and stuff he couldn't handle it
yeah
well seems to me if a person gets into that area
they i don't know it seems like if you're going to get in that area and spend the time learning it because you do have to go to school on some of it
yeah and
yeah i i've heard a lot of bad things about them mistreating people and
i've even heard of some people being sexually abused
yeah they steal from them
i
yeah
yeah
yeah
in each square
that's not right
i've only known two people in a nursing home and you know it was my grandmother and grandfather on my father's side and i just heard through my father what was going on and
yeah
yeah something i guess you get forced to do make decisions and
yeah
yeah
yeah
you know that's what i've heard too you know i heard that they just put them in there because they don't want to mess with them
yeah well i've heard some things you know i don't know where i heard it from it might have been a movie or something where they made a apartment complex into a
what you're saying for people who can take care of themselves but they need a little help in doing it
yeah each of them have their own little apartment or little
yeah well do they share rooms in nursing homes
bad news
i'll say something i said in the last conversation i hope i'm never in that position where i have to be put in one from all i've heard about it just not and i've heard
yeah
well if it ain't well you know
well
yeah i have my beliefs in the hereafter and i believe that god will take care of them
true
yeah
or mine yeah i got you there
or you can force them to do it if you know
yeah
no it's not
yeah
yeah i was going to say you have to pay something like three and four times more
well
yeah and he'd have to pay it all
yeah i know what big families are like and how they can get together if you if they're really cooperative and wanting the best
yeah
yeah
well i know my mom from a family of at least sixteen i've lost count and my grandmother just died sometime last well about two years ago
and they was all talking about pulling together and paying for the
hospital costs and stuff and you know there's some of my family that's not exactly in the homeless level but you know darn close
and then there's others who is uh-huh lots better off
and
you know well in california too i've got a friend that lives out there and she's got a little two three bedroom house with a double car garage and it's costing her a thousand dollars a month
california is high
well that's
well that's a good initiative i guess if but
they were just talking about how they had all these drive by shootings and stuff and it sounded like it was getting to be like la a little bit but
oh are you so you're right familiar with all that i bet
oh it's a what
oh yeah
oh that young huh you're kidding at
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah so they're getting started
oh you're kidding
i'll bet
my wife was just talking to her mother and i guess they said they had an f b i guy come to there she works in a middle school and they were talking about how the hats signify you know gang and stuff like that and
and that you know it some day it'll eventually past but right now they say there's all kinds of kids getting beat up because of the they wear the wrong hat on the wrong street and that's get it's getting pretty darn scary i've got a little eighteen
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah i think we've probably got it to a lesser extent i wouldn't say we're anywhere close to some of those other places probably like what you have but
it you know they say i guess a lot of the people that they the gang related things they put them in jail and then they when they get out they just say get lost just don't hang around l a or don't hang around wherever and so they just move on to new territory and where ever they can find easy pickings but
you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse it it's pretty sad like you say you see all these kids thirteen fourteen year olds and you know it'll be a school night and they're out at ten eleven o'clock just roaming the streets and
i just never remember that when you know it's been a while since i was in junior high or high or even elementary school but
you i just you were never out past eight or nine o'clock on a school night you know if you were even up out of bed you were lucky it seemed like and
yeah that's true and you know and i think when it come
pardon
yeah its getting worse i you know like i say i
yeah with that with that mormon influence it may not be as bad but we still get a lot of the two the two parent income or the two income families and i really think that's a lot of the problem its just you don't get all the values taught in the home that you used to get
and the kids are left to do their own thing and find their own you know entertainment and stuff and i really think that's what you're we miss a lot of the those good values that were taught years ago to
uh-huh
uh-huh
yo yeah
i would think so yeah
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh really
huh not by their families or anything
uh-huh
uh-huh
sheesh
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh jeez
uh-huh
jeez
huh
you're kidding you know and that and it's so sad because you i mean sure it's the kids doing it but you know who really is has the blame for that yeah
oh yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
okay i don't have any i guess definite views about elderly care
the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that i think that's one thing that i would look at if i was
putting my grandmother or my mother
in some sort of home the first thing that i would look at would be their history
as far as any court cases that came out of there the history of you know their doctors their nurses and things like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i'm just out of curiosity what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place what
huh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my goodness
uh-huh
in pain or something yeah
uh-huh
yeah that's what i was going to say it sounds like to just neglect all over neglect you know to clean up and
right
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
that's great
homely yeah
i would i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or
anyone is in a home like that and my biggest fear would that they would be is that they would be lonely
and i would like to know that there are
you know just a lot of activities like you said you know just putting a plant in a room you know just makes just brightens and just makes them just a little more active television
they can go outside and just to know that they're not you know laying in a room looking at gray walls you know that would
that that's what would just really kill me i'd like to know that you know they have friends there and they you know have little conversations and things i'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and
maybe some kind of activity little field trips or something i don't know how they would do that but
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
uh-huh i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that that's really neat that's really neat
right uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that is great for that will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew that you know that the puppy is coming on wednesday
you know that would be something to look for that's really neat that really is
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah
putting any of my family in an elderly
and i know it's hard for you know a lot of families if you're trying to work or trying to take care of your own family it's kind of hard to
to because an elderly person sometimes can be
totally dependent you know on you and i know that's hard sometimes and but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just i would feel so guilty
just i don't know unless i knew that they were somewhere just really
i mean just really great like you know that they were really enjoying
i don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah uh-huh
to nod their head and smile at them
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
oh
oh
that's something that i mean if i had to work
in an elderly home i don't think i could do it
like i would really like to be a teacher
but i don't think i could do it because i'm very emotional
and the minute i mean the minute something happens i mean i cry on i mean you know hallmark commercials but i'm just that's just the end of me
and so i mean something real life i just i'm
i interview a lot of children i'm an education reporter
and i always go you know everyday i'm doing an education things and
i meet these kids who are you know dropping out of school left and right and all the sudden they're in this program they're making straight a's they're going to graduate early
and i'm just i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic and you know if i can i can just imagine you know working in a home like that
and those people they just they're so sweet and so genuine
you know and all they want is just for everything to be happy and you know
and so that would probably just tear me apart everyday yeah i mean in a good way but you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i'm sure
uh-huh
yeah
right yeah
yeah
and children i mean
usually a lot of elderly people like to
they like to share their experiences with the younger children they'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they don't even know what they mean but
you know they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it and i'm sure i'll be like that too
yeah
but that's great i didn't know there were such groups
uh-huh
yeah
and i would hate it if anyone put me in one women
somebody take care of me
oh goodness
okay
okay well nice to talk to you
okay uh-huh bye-bye
well i really enjoy reading the newspaper we get the daily and dallas morning news
um-hum
well we i don't take like time or newsweek or anything like that but i do like to watch cnn i have several chores and things to do so it comes on at
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum
uh-huh
well i wouldn't think i would really say that that's not true because it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates
and so news stations always tell the story from a certain angle and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions you may never get the truth but you'll have a variety to choose from
um-hum
um-hum
no i don't
to keep an eye out for it but i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio
um-hum
um-hum
well i am we're fairly new to the area and so we're still shopping for a favorite channel
um-hum
well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that there's all of the anchors
are seem to be like white anglo saxon protestant type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer
a you know some females i don't recall that they have any female anchors and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people
um-hum
yes i have and i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you're more likely to get
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
oh really
a favorite or i did have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news i guess because you get use to you like the anchors and you feel comfortable with them and
um-hum
um-hum
that's true their job
yes i guess it is time to close now so i can run go help put the kids to bed but i have yes it's nice bye-bye
i'm in dallas texas what about yourself
uh-huh
no i've lived here for almost five years now
and i'm a before that i was at school in rochester new york and i'm originally from boston
that's right but i like it
um-hum
i know
yeah
tell me where that is
okay sure
oh okay yeah i know that area that's a nice area
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
well i am i'm gosh i'm barely in dallas i'm just north of addison airport up on the tollway
and i guess we have a similar situation i mean we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy eighty thousand and then we've got bent tree right across the street
so i don't i don't even know how high those go but some of those are pretty big
they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a couple miles so
yeah
um-hum
yeah i've noticed that
um-hum
we've got a house let's see we moved in about four years ago
and it was it had previously been unoccupied but it had existed for three years
this is a whole block of homes that a builder built all of them and i guess he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away
type of deal so the whole block was all foreclosed
and so some were vacant for quite a while before they you know they finally sold them because there were so many
but yeah so we just you know we bargained to get an extra warranty on that
and we're really we haven't had any problems and you know we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything
between we put in our own sprinkler system and i just finished repainting the exterior and you know making drapes and buying furniture it's just a money pit really is
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh no
right
uh-huh
uh-huh had
she has three kids eleven nine and eight
uh-huh
it's all right
uh-huh
uh-huh so they're pretty good kids huh
yeah
well we had well growing up i guess i can talk about us we had nine kids in our family we had eight boys and one girl
so that's how we spent most of the time with him yeah
uh-huh
oh
yeah that's exactly what it was
uh-huh
oh
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah it's like you said it's you know to each his own i mean we're planning on having my wife stay home and but
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
oh
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
well that's good sounds like you're have a handle on it
for a couple years
okay
okay now as you were saying
uh-huh
right that's true i have the same problem i've in fact both of us like cheese my children are grown now and i also like ice cream so
oh
yeah well
everyone has their own little things right his is ice cream or hot fudge sundaes but i tell you what we use to do even when the children were growing up every friday night
would be our night that
put to kids to bed when they were younger and my wife and i would she'd set the dining room table with candles and
and no one disturbed us no one called on friday night and we would just have this quiet dinner for the two of us
and that that's held up until our youngest is graduating college in the couple of weeks and we still do that
well we also like to do is we like to cook out a lot even in the winter time we got we got a grill and i've got like a wood shop off the garage and i've got a
so i can give you something that we like to do
or
well clams casino if you like clams casino
and in a restaurant they just kind of serve them on a half shell with a little bit of stuffing
what we like the to do is
is to cut them out and then cut them into little quarters or eighths you know not so much just one big bite
and then cut up fresh peppers and fresh tomatoes and fresh celery and bread crumbs and mix it all together
and
pre cook bacon so it's kind of soft
and put a strip of bacon over the top of that and then and then pop them in the oven
and we usually have that and then we'll have a salad
and i'll throw a steak on the on the grill with what i call a potato bake
i buy a
a couple of yams and some either red potato or either white potato
so they're fairly soft and i slice them i peel the yam slice that
i slice the white potato with the skin on
oh
and then i put it in tin foil and i interweave i put a i put a slice of white potato and slice sweet potato and slice of onion
and then i do that until i got
the size of a baked potato
put butter and salt on it garlic
close the tin foil and i throw it on the grill cause i like it a little crispy on the bottom so i throw it on the grill maybe about
ten minutes before i put the steak on
and then once the steak is done that's usually done
and then we have
and then either spinach i like spinach or asparagus
because we grow own asparagus we have asparagus patch so in fact right now it's in season so we just go out and there
lop off a few
and then whatever you want for desert
that's nice
yeah
uh-huh
okay
okay
when you say lemon pepper marinade you put lemon juice and pepper together
the spice that you buy
okay all right
oh yeah
okay
okay
uh-huh
yes
two
two tablespoons wait a minute that was two tablespoons of worcestershire
okay
uh-huh
yeah
so you thoroughly cooked the pork is cooked at that point then okay
oh no
oh
that's what we do we grow our own and dry them and
yeah you guys are kind of lucky down there
yes
okay yep
oh that's what we do we yeah
like a pesto yeah
so is it a cup of basil leave fresh basil leaves
yeah
that's
we're going we're going to have that friday we're going to do the pork and
we don't have the we don't have any fresh basil but we've got dried well we'll have to go down to the market
it doesn't you can't make a pesto out of it they've got some pesto frozen though
but i like that i like those uh-huh i like that sauce with the pork
and
yeah
that's what i'm going to do because we each take turns doing it
and just make the sauce
yep
yep
we do we make all of our vinegars in fact we do canning too we do all of our own canning and
do you have any pets
oh you do
oh my goodness are they a specialty kind of cats or
um-hum
oh my
um-hum
well we have a cat and a dog and a turtle
it's just a small one it's not one of those large ones at all it's a very small turtle
and they had it in their classroom all year long almost and were going to let it go
and i didn't have the heart it wasn't even my classroom it was the next door classroom i didn't have the heart to watch them let it go so i said i would keep it during the summer time so we are
oh gee
oh
oh
uh-huh oh my goodness well you know and it's very hard for me to have any living creatures
and then sort of watch them disappear it was no trouble to have this turtle it has tank and then they don't do anything and it's not large
and our cat is a another little story we've had the cat for several years now but when my children
started school at cistercian school up in irving you might be familiar with it since you're from the general location it's a boys school well anyway one of the persons in the car pool
but he said that when the cats were weaned that we would take one of the cats
now i don't really mind i don't really mind but i know that once you take a little living creature there that there's another responsibility in the house and
so we have a what do we have siamese all the siamese traits came out in this one particular cat it's not a thoroughbred siamese
but it looks if you were to see it you'd say oh you have a siamese cat but i know it's not a thoroughbred but it and we have had her for many
oh gosh i think we've had her almost eight years now
seven years or something
oh my
oh my
um-hum
right
um-hum
oh i see
um-hum well our cat is
is not the most lap cat although she will when she's in the right mood you know let you hold her on her lap and you know she's not
a bad cat but she kind of is her own cat in her own way although as i said she will she will come around you and she will let you hold her but she's not really a lap cat hum-um
yeah
oh we have a black lab
and actually it's a cross between a golden and a black so it has longer hair
and we've had her now for
oh about almost
ten or eleven years now
oh yeah
and her son which is my father
is also elderly and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years now my father's almost eighty my grandmother's almost ninety seven
so
it's strange because it so hit so close to home
but my father's an only child and really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother she had many sisters and a couple of them took care of her
and then one her last sister died and it was
probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was
and plus she was driving my father crazy she went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers so she's kind of cranky to get along with there's nothing physically wrong with her except she's very old
yeah you don't know if their complaints are legitimate
we don't have that problem up here we might maybe in a rural maybe there's a bad a bad home in a rural area but it would be a very small one
the one my grandmother's in is very hospital like there were some really nice ones here all the a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations
and he could he could easily have put her into a nicer home but up here there's waiting lists and that was the first one that opened and i suggested to him why don't you change
he said well these people here are they are very nice to her and he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice
so the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job
i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother and i know the staff very well so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that but i have heard of really awful conditions
especially down the southern part of the country which is
oh that's terrible
well that's good so is your grandmother impaired is she of alzheimer's or something like that
oh
oh that does happen yeah
yep
you know my neighbors across the street their mother was sick at times and
they couldn't handle her so they put her in a home and then the old frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids oh you still need your mother i guess i'll look after her and that what happens a lot when people are sick
or they just real manic depressants they end up being put in homes and it's like oh well but that's it's i'm really glad that i come from an area where
that there's good people in the homes but it's just as it doesn't matter if it is like you say the best place
they still don't want to go to these homes and my grandmother's real there i mean she cries every day this has been over a year and she tries to make me feel really guilty but i have to you know
i have to put my foot down where my life begins i mean if that was my mother i would really i feel a lot more responsible i would probably take care of my mother i don't really
when my father when something if anything happens to him
i don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home and hopefully that he can get along with
in-house help so he he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day
because i think that's the best situation is when you're you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to go into a home because
like i say my father's eighty and he's really active he still has his driver's license here i mean you wouldn't believe what he does he actually tows cars
and as the years got on the tow trucks got better there easier and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one so he won't have to do very much work
so someone like that they i really don't want to see them go in a home he's got two dogs that are his constant companions and he always replaces them you know i've had like
over the past thirty years i've had you know about seven or eight different dogs all the time and there all
you know it's like oops dad's got these two and the old one dies and the young one goes for a while and he gets another one so i can't see him without his animals even though it's very expensive to stay at home
mentally it's just the best thing for you i mean when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have
and i'm thinking when i get older i think
if i brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home i don't want to be a selfish you know a burden on anyone that's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through
and i'm and i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place
my taste buds are pretty flexible and here they are they're always used to these
old fashioned foods they're really set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home and now they're feeding them quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat
just they don't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that that's the thing my grandmother really misses i mean really growls about
yeah i know if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the in-law apartment
and have it on you know one floor and really easy access well that's what i'm telling my father now he needs a new floor in his bathroom and i says now is the time redo your whole bathroom so you can get in and out
um-hum
that's right your usually probably more adept at more adept at the news than most people i would assume i
i don't quite have as regimented of a ritual as you do i get up in the morning if i don't have to go to work
and i'll grab the paper i'll usually pull out the sports section and the business section and try to read those two first and then after i get through those
i'll turn to the front
front page news and if an article catches my eye i'll read it
otherwise i'll just flip through the paper and you know like i said if nothing really sounds interesting i'll just skip over it
do you do you guys have a pretty thick paper there in houston on sundays
okay that's a that's a good sized paper
there's a couple hours project right there
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
was that peter jennings yeah
into either the five thirty the local news or the six o'clock news i
the local news is
to me it isn't that interesting because it's
generally not too much human interest stuff it's more the you know somebody died here or we had a fire here
where the local news meant something to me because i could relate to the area or to the town or to the people but you know in when you have a dallas fort worth market
i really don't care what happened in fort worth or arlington for that matter
um-hum
well
let me see
let me see interesting subject i was i was a law student for a year and a half so i've got slight bit of expertise in that area
not much
i
okay
um-hum
okay it depends on the kind of action it is and also depends on the state you don't have to have a jury of twelve and that's true in just about all states
it just depends on which ever state statue governs on the selection of juries now the term petit usually applies to grand juries you have a grand jury and a petit grand jury
sometimes in some states they also call a less than twelve member jury a petit jury did that sufficiently confuse you
when do you have what a jury
um-hum
okay
okay i still don't get it both what
at the same time
oh okay yeah
okay well what they do is on a criminal indictment first they go to the grand jury okay the grand jury will either indite or not once a person is indicted then they generally have an evidentiary hearing
and it's strange that there would have been a jury there because evidentiary hearings are just before the judge now it's possible they had another trial
in which
now i don't know enough about it to really to really say
how long did the other trial go do you know
yeah the thing is
in almost every case when there's a question about the evidence against the person there's what's called an evidentiary hearing
and the both sides get up there and the judge decides whether or not the evidence is good
and if the evidence is good then they go ahead and go to trial so you were probably being tapped for the jury for the trial
what's that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
well it's hard to get out of jury duty i mean it's an obligation on each citizen and short of any of the special circumstances then they generally won't let you out
um-hum
right
yeah
well as long as they didn't question you too closely i mean the thing is the easiest way to get out of one of these things is
they'll ask you questions like do you know the defendant have you heard anything about the case do you have any specially if it's a murder case they may be asking for a capital
a capital's capital punishment
you can always say that you object to that and they'll let you off there
yeah
yeah that's that won't get you off
you have to be you have to be dead set against it
the fact that you're willing the fact that you believe in it doesn't matter of course they're going to ask you do you think you could impose it in this case
i mean if he did something really gross then yeah
ugh
oh god
yeah right
oh god
they ought to make this into a tv show
yeah he's going to turn states evidence
god
now that would have been fun to sit in on
um-hum
um-hum
nothing like taking your what you ought to do is reschedule your vacation real quick
oh
yeah gosh
what a way to spend your vacation
yeah that that's
well it may because it it's something that could have influenced your
your bias
so there's a good chance if they if they ask you about it you know i wouldn't just come out and say i think the guys guilty
but i would say that i've heard enough about this that i really have a preconceived notion
of what the guy did
and i think that you know
in other words if you if you can just show that you're not going to be
that you can't be unbiased that's going to be enough
well there's been all kinds of talk about it but quite honestly i don't think there's anything else that we could put in place that would work as well i mean i realize it's cumbersome and
it's time consuming and at times even ridiculous but it nobody's come up with any better solution
well that is that's a
that's one of those things i think's sort of a preconceived notion on the part of the public they you can have a whole bunch of money and you can have the best lawyers but
you know if you've got if you've got a reasonable jury who will look at the evidence i mean you see that's what it all comes down to it's the jury
if they are
i mean there's no doubt that you can pick a jury okay in some in some respects you can get the kind of jury you want
but short of that i mean if people are reasonable and they'll look at the evidence and decide on that basis then you know supposedly money doesn't count
but on the other hand what can you do about it i what solution is there
oh you mean a court appointed lawyer
yeah there's little doubt that i mean obviously a court appointed lawyer doesn't have the time or the resources to do as much
but on the other hand i mean again what can be done about it you know
it's one of those i think unsolvable sort of things i mean we make the motions of
all right clarice what's your favorite basketball team
the mavericks yeah
yeah they didn't quite make the play-offs though
but
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh the celtics
the they are a team is what's really good about them
they just work the ball and pass around and make each other look good
yeah
makes it little more fun to watch at times
yeah
you like danny ainge
why do you like danny ainge that that's i mean you've named like four of the top names in the game and then you come up with danny ainge
did he play byu oh you went to byu huh okay
yeah
yeah he's well i have nothing against him i just
i wondered yeah i wondered everybody has their favorite you know maybe not the big name player but
yeah he's playing a vital role he he's playing for portland he's playing for portland he's i mean he's coming in and doing a good job he's it was a great trade how they got him
um-hum
seems like
i don't know if it's mainly because of him but it seems that he plays for top teams
and you know contenders he might have did he go straight from boston to portland or did he hit another team on the way
but
yeah
yeah
but yeah he's i like to watch him play because he's a yeah he's pretty tough you know he's a scrappy guy
he's a competitor
oh do i have a favorite team well i'm from indiana so i like the pacers and
i like larry bird because he's from the home state also
i just likewatch him play anyway
let's see i like the bulls because they're from the chicago area and they've suffered through many a hard season before they got jordan
and even then once they got him they didn't make the play-offs for a couple years they had to gradually build up a supporting cast because you can't just win with one player in the nba you have to have a you know a good solid team
even though one player can carry a bulk of the of the scoring load you know you have to have the other players there to complement him and finally with pippen and some of the horace grant some of the other guys are coming right along
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
well they made a couple trades this year that well fat lever was hurt most of the year
and that so they didn't get to reap any benefits from that and i don't know how well alex english did but
okay
see we don't have a tv so i didn't get to watch any of the mavericks i think i got to watch probably one game all year so
yeah
well they move around so much
can't hardly keep a one coach where he's at for very long enough to get know who he is
yeah i think like you said i mean tarpley if he was had his life straightened up he could really help a ball club but you know the way he's operating now he's more of a detriment than anything else
they should
yeah
uh-huh
right
top physical condition too
so do you like college basketball high school ball anything like that
uh-huh
um-hum
oh
good
yeah
yeah i it's fun watching basketball at all different levels i mean there are benefits and
bad points of watching it each different one i mean you may not see a spectacular michael jordanish move from a high school player but you know it's more of an accomplishment if they hit
you know some three pointers or something the game is you know it's just a different game pretty much but that's sort of what makes it fun
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah he's
yeah
yeah
takes a lot of working
well spud was just gifted with a exceptional vertical leap and that's what helps him out more than anything else
plus you know he's like you said he's worked hard at it i'm sure
yeah
okay and i'm melanie from harrisville utah
okay have you ever had to plan a family reunion
oh
uh-huh
and how did you feel it went
oh
all of this planning and getting together and such
oh let's see what else
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
oh
oh that's good
uh-huh
and then did you have a main meal or did everyone just bring it was just potluck uh-huh
oh
oh now how old is she
oh goodness is she pretty spry is she you know pretty
oh wow
uh-huh
yeah
because our family is quite large like your family there and
so that was a real challenge and i was president of our family reunion for two years and
uh-huh
oh
oh well that is that is helpful yeah our family ranges from oh goodness
well australia i have a brother lives in australia to boise idaho and
and all kinds of places
oh
in
oh
uh-huh
boy
oh my gosh
so the topic is vacations
i think so
i enjoy them
the last was back down to lubbock to visit parents
it was
the last one was back down to lubbock texas visit family
but that's not the tradition for us
we enjoyed yellowstone real well last year
yeah
oh rocky mountain national park
it's just like any of the other national parks it
you know there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching and
oh it's
yeah
we usually try and drive up there oh once every year or two
sure
to the top the of the peak sure
oh it's not bad at all
it's a beautiful drive
now i admit up there the altitude is kind of
interesting
you know you get a little lightheaded and giddy but it's fun
you know take along a picnic lunch and
oh we love it
no they're only to the east i mean to the west of us
here in the springs you know it's right there at the very foot of the rockies
you know and once a week we drive up into the mountains usually you know usually once a week once every other week
yeah well i enjoy the hills
in texas too i've been in sherman
no i haven't you
once to mexico city but just a little day thing on business
that's nice
did you enjoy it
did you enjoy it
uh-huh
got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture and
oh
huh
so the place that i went that we've gone on vacation that i think i enjoyed the most
was seattle
well
we
was two years ago
we went during the drought
i'm sorry three years ago it had been dry for a whole week
it didn't rain for a whole week
yeah somehow we picked the right time and
walked down on the wharf and i think we ate seafood every meal for
well not quite every meal but most meals for a week
it was wonderful the pacific science museum the little girl really enjoyed it's
very interesting
yeah
yes it was it was super and
went to the seattle aquarium
and it's right down there
on the
right there on the ocean and
down there on the wharf by the piers and all and
you walk down in a dome a glass dome
and the bay is circulating over your head and you can
you can watch the fish swim by and sharks and
oh it's
yeah and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises and oh it's amazing
oh absolutely
without a doubt
seattle is beautiful and the mountains the mountains to the east of seattle
are just incredible
i rode a ferry for the first time in my life
you know up there
you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry
instead of by bridge
and you drive your car on you park your car you set your brake you walk upstairs and you have a beer
or coffee or whatever depending on the time of day
it's amazing
yes
yes
yeah and
there are people literally that
everyday take the ferry you know and drive on to it yeah
live on an island off shore from seattle
and
you everyday they drive on the ferry they go upstairs and have their morning coffee
take for the twenty to
hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and
you know depending on where it is
well some places you know in some areas it you know it depends how far they are commuting
oh it it's strict i'm a west texan
out there in the land of no water
and
and to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me
you know it's a different life style
than we are used to
oh galveston
yes i liked galveston real well
there's one of the
areas down there close to galveston is
i forget the name of the island but it's a bird sanctuary
with all kinds of wild birds
whooping and sand hill cranes and ducks and
pelicans and it's very pretty i like the rio grande valley
real well of course you haven't lived until you have been to san antone to the to the alamo and take
yeah the river walk oh it's
and you need to go in the spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there oh it's just simply beautiful
and of course always when i lived in west texas had to annually go down to san antone just
yeah and go to
lone star and you know
make my annual pilgrimage to the lone star brewery and
el paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way you know go across the border and all the davis mountains are interesting
out there in west texas
yeah now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter
because
there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up
you know whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at it's most enjoyable
to get you know to get warm
that's nice
down there in the lower rio grande valley
closer to where the rio grande empties into the gulf that's interesting i love the texas hill country
and
austin's neat for an occasional visit
yeah it it's fun few days
oh ut is real pretty
there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area marble falls and all that's real pretty
i would say definitely go see that part and
i'd say go to
midland once just for the heck of it
i don't know why exactly
but
you know find out when they are holding
the
petroleum fair
so what kind of eating out do you like
yeah i like seafood or chinese or especially mongolian we've got a real nice little mongolian restaurant here yeah i go out there probably once a week it's not bad you know
you have to find out the right things to get so you get the most for your money but the two the two plates of meat and one plate of vegetables is a pretty good deal
yeah
no
oh yeah
do
yeah do you have a do you have a steak and ale there
i haven't been to steak and ale for a long time but my favorite used to be their steak and alaskan king crab oh that was good
yeah
yeah they had they had really nice alaskan king crab of course it was expensive though dinner for two was about fifty bucks
uh-huh
yeah i haven't found a good mexican restaurant around here anywhere i i'm at i usually do all my own mexican food i my i'm partial to burritos and tacos and i and i do them better than anywhere i've had out so
and i can do them cheaper and i can do them my way
and places place
basically the food and the price i it's sort it's set up on a sort of a buffet sort of thing you go up and pick your own vegetables and all that fill up your own plate and then you drop it off at the grill
and then go sit down and they fry it out and season it the way you want it seasoned and then they bring it out to you and the price is really reasonable the drawback is that
all the all the staff are either koreans or
or thais and they can't speak english very well so it gets a little bit difficult trying to explain some things to them but if you can get past that it's okay the food is really good
i don't know i to me that's the thing that you got to have if the food is bad you're obviously not going to go back but if the food is good and the price is decent and the service is lousy i have a tough time going back again
course a yeah i mean it's not worth the hassle just for the good food there's plenty of places that have good food
uh-huh yeah i hardly ever give the people a second try if somebody's rude to me or
excuse me somebody's rude or something like that i won't go back i don't care how good the food was
but generally i the places i've been where i've had trouble with the help generally the food hasn't been that good anyway which is sort of indicative of the whole problem
i try to go out once a week sometimes more than that i about every other weekend i go down to charlotte and
see my ex-college buddy down there and we go out running around down there and there's some pretty good places down there to eat
but we've got a family there's a family restaurant here i don't know if they're over in texas yet i know they're in louisiana it's called ryan's
it's a it's a good restaurant they have like a big food bar and you can order from the menu or
just take the food bar and the food bar usually has all kinds of entree items or salads and all that and they've just got tons of stuff and it's really cheap one person for about it's about six bucks and it's all you can eat
and the food is good and of course you your service is pretty good because it's serve yourself can't complain too much they have people come around and
deliver your meal from the kitchen if you ordered a steak or something and fill up your iced tea but other than that they don't they don't bother you
so it's a pretty good place i bet you don't have those over there
we have
there's two of them in charlotte and we've been to both of them and they're both terrible it was it was i was amazed because i've been in a lot of ryan's in alabama and georgia
and this is my first time in one in north carolina and they were terrible
and we got one in raleigh here and i thought it was pretty bad until i had gone to those ones in charlotte
yeah we figured this is probably the best one but it's a pretty neat chain because they don't take out loans for anything they
when they build a building they pay for it right then so that when they open the door they're making money immediately it's a smart operation
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
i would
yeah exactly and you and you cook it yourself
gosh that's half the fun cooking it yourself
well that's an interesting sounding place
yeah
yeah
yeah that sounds pretty neat it'd be worth giving a try
that's pretty interesting i've never heard of anything like that
huh
that's a unique idea i guess that's part of the game nowadays in fast food you got to come up with some catchy idea
yeah
he surely doesn't have to worry about supply
that's a pretty good idea
huh
maybe i'll start a restaurant now
i don't know if i trust these people in raleigh to cook anything though
probably burn the place down
well come to think i've never even seen a mexican here
oh well
well i guess that about does it on the fast food circuit doesn't it
yeah right
it was good talking to you jackie you have a good night bye-bye
hi my name's bridgette
hi nice to meet you do you know what we're supposed to talk about
yeah so are you ready then okay
uh-huh okay so what do you think is wrong with the school system
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i know where my mom teaches you know and she teaches in like a lower class
part of plano and where it is they just send their kids to school and you know they don't care if they do their homework if they don't do their homework whatever
so she says it's very hard from that aspect i mean she'll call the parents and they you know they're like you know that's not my responsibility it's yours
and i know she gets real frustrated being a teacher that she feels like you know that the parents aren't willing to do that which is very scary i think
another thing i think though is i know now because i'm getting ready to graduate and friends of mine that are getting teaching degrees are
people that aren't getting a master's are having an easier time getting a job because they can get paid less
and it seems like they're just compromising good qualified educated teachers just for someone they can pay less and they get they don't get paid much now and i think that's really bad
uh-huh
yeah
yeah uh-huh i think it was
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
i think it's hard though because even like the like in high school and stuff you take the standardized tests and stuff and i know people that you know are like i mean i know people in college that are like dyslexic
that i wonder how they pass through all their school you know all their years of school
yeah that's definitely true
um-hum
see yeah
um-hum
all the problems they have and all the problems like in general in the world like with gangs and stuff just being brought into the school is making it worse i think that's not even helping at all
yeah
well how do you use your credit cards
yeah
um-hum
yeah especially what i do
yeah
ridiculously high
um-hum
well so
yeah
yeah
i got rid of a lot of them especially the ones where i paid fees
i kept the ones that were free
and basically the same thing i use them if i'm running short of cash and there's something i want or a sale or
when i travel i use them
yeah
yeah it's about
yeah that's what i do
yeah if there's running into a cash short or something there's some things some purchases i make that i will do always on credit card just so i have a record of them just like when i take all my cats down to the vet i always pay that on credit card
yeah
hum-um
yeah
yeah
yeah i
yeah you're already approved then it's back
i for the longest time i i'd gotten rid of my gas credit cards and then all of a sudden i started getting a flurry of these things so i did i have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple months
but
yeah
oh do you yeah
oh you should have used it you wouldn't have been liable for the payment
yeah
they yeah they send you card
that you didn't apply for it's yours
yeah
sure yeah i had a i had a tough battle with exxon several years ago
oh really what do you got out there
mobils yeah
yeah
yeah well i don't think i don't think we've got a citgo here in raleigh no matter of fact i know we don't
we have several convenience stores that sell citgo gas but they're not citgo stations i guess
the biggies around here are exxon texaco and
well gosh that's about it bp i guess
gosh i haven't seen a sinclair station in years
yeah
yeah
just barely i guess
well
no i i've nope i've never had that
i did have a problem with american express one time about ten years ago when i first got started in a business
they got my name of course
and i said yeah this will be handy because i can use this for all my business expenses so i used it went on a went on a trip and used it got the bill and paid it
about three weeks later i get this nasty letter from them saying you haven't paid you're overdue pay it
so i ignored it assuming that the things had crossed in the mail about two weeks after that i get a phone call
say you are really overdue you need to pay this thing
and i said what are you talking about i've already paid you and by that time the bank statement had come in and i had the canceled check
so they said okay we'll take care of it
two weeks later i get another nasty letter threatening legal action
so i sent them a letter with a copy of the canceled check and their card cut up into about a hundred pieces i said here is your card here is the copy of my canceled check never send me anything else
and never heard from them
but i just
yeah i just you know i ain't got time to mess around with them
too many people want my money out there i don't have to pay somebody to take it
no i don't i kept i kept thinking about getting it but i just don't use the things enough to justify getting it
um-hum
that's right that's right you're paying you're paying a higher interest rate so they can rebate you two percent of it
um-hum
hum that's right
yeah right and in the meantime for that entire year they've got the use of that money
yeah it's
america's americans are suckers
yeah
they don't know how to sit there and look at the interest rate and say well this one is only sixteen percent and this one's twenty two hum
yeah i
yeah right that's
i've only got i've only got two cards now i've got a bank of scotland visa and a citibank mastercard
and that's it i mean i don't need anything else now
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah something like that
my roommate really believes in american express he's got the green or the gold card and the optima card and
he just he just thinks they're terrific
and i sit there and say yeah look what you pay for that every year
yeah
gosh
yeah
yeah i'm thinking myself
really yeah you know he's impressed because they send you this nice statement every i guess it's every year
for that report
don't be crazy
when i was over in england i picked up that bank of scotland visa card and i don't know i don't ever use it except when i want to play the currency market
that's when it becomes handy because if i know that you know if the if the if the pound is high i can buy more dollar things
for what i'm getting and then if i think the rate's going to drop then i pay them back in less dollars
and it it's worked out most of the times i'm usually pretty good on calling the currency market
yeah
yeah i did it
and i really had a racket going because my paycheck was being electronically deposited here in the states
and the bank that i banked with i could write them a check on an american bank and they would give me instant credit for it
so
and i and over the course of a year i figured out how long it took them to clear that check and the and the shortest period of time was eight days
so generally about eight days before payday depending on what the currency markets were doing i would go up and start buying i'd start cashing in my checks for pounds
and then by the time
it the rate was either down or up depending on what i was doing and it was great i mean i could
yeah and i mean one day you know i might be able to get
okay jay where do you live in texas
in dallas
what's that the i-30 and central express
okay yeah
right
yeah
oh is that right
oh how about that
it's a new home
about eight years
oh
uh-huh
right uh-huh well we live in a brick story and a half
cape cod style i guess you'd call it and a big
sun room on the back of it
it
uh-huh
yeah this is very traditional
uh-huh
uh-huh do you have children at home
three oh boy
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh well
it's oh about twenty five twenty five hundred square feet i guess
it's four bedrooms and two baths
and that it has one wing built on it's a kitchen family room and then big room on the back
uh-huh
two and two uh-huh
right uh-huh i was just reading an article
i guess so
uh-huh
few years
uh-huh
right well our daughter and son-in-law moved up back up here he's from texas but course she's from here
about a year and a half ago
and had their house on the market down there and they never did sell it so they stayed six months and she got her job back and he got a job down there because
huh-uh
no
they live in rowlett
have you
uh-huh
uh-huh
what college are you teaching
oh
uh-huh
garland uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right
oh right
they require it before
employment as a condition of employment and then they have random testing
i don't know about after accidents because industrial accidents i guess are relatively rare at ti
yeah
i really
um-hum
yeah for cause
for cause i just i'm not convinced that wheeling all this machinery in place and testing a lot of
i think the yield is very low
it's a lot of expense i know for
companies that aren't doing well
um-hum
no
yeah
and
i think i'm just worried about what they'll do next
yeah
yeah
right
i'm afraid they'll start picking out people with every possible type of risk factor and trying to exclude them from health coverage
right drug testing could be the first step towards that so i hope they do it very carefully and
sensitive to what the to the peoples privacy
um-hum
how the mavericks doing
so-so
uh-huh
right
story with tarpley is he is he history altogether
that's kind of in a
oh tough situation they're handling
really they gave him every chance possible with him
is that right
uh-huh he's talented player but
well you know because i follow the jazz fairly closely and then you know we're in the same conference
you know keep tabs on them a little bit
they're doing well i
they're in the in the head of the division and just won the last two road games they beat philadelphia tonight
it was a close one beat them by two points or three points but yeah they're doing they're doing great they had this little incident i don't know if you heard about it with carl
there was a i guess they played last friday here in salt lake
and about the first two minutes of the game isaiah drove in and malone went up to block the shot and really fouled him hard so hard that it put him to the floor and he had like twenty stitches above his eye
and they in reviewing the tapes decided it was a flagrant foul
oh i guess they decided it was flagrant foul at the time of the ball game and ejected carl
and then he got a he got a ten thousand dollar fine and one game suspension which is about another thirty five thousand
so it was a forty five thousand dollar deal for him and i believe it was unintentional he fouled him hard but it wasn't like he had you know malicious intent to go cream the guy
so there's been a big buzz about that how detroit's the bad boys of the league to begin with and when something like that happens to one of their players they're all claiming that
you know it was totally uncalled for this unnecessary violence when they've been guilty of that kind of thing for years
laimbeer and rodman are about the two worst
anyway
oh is that right
you've been busy huh
yeah
yeah
that's true
yeah
well i've had about enough of magic johnson for the year though
i guess where he's appears he's touring with the team and jabbar's thinking of coming out of retirement to help fund the aids research and
i don't know you hear both those stories
i guess that's a nice gesture on jabbar's part
yeah
yeah
yeah
i guess maybe we'll
you know some good come of it because of this
you know it's a notoriety and focus that it'll have on the disease
yeah i don't know how the lakers are going to do without him this year they they're doing all right now from what i see but
yeah he's the was the heart and soul of that group so
anyway what other teams you follow any
uh-huh
yeah
well the cowboys are a lot more popular aren't they
uh-huh
well
oh is that right
uh-huh
yeah well
okay
you know taking the idea of
sentencing in into their hands versus you know the jury especially if it's a highly publicized case
such as you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read certain
things in regards to cases like the dahmer case in milwaukee and stuff so it's it may be an idea to think about
you know cost trying to find a jury so you get a jury as far as
they may say they're not biased but deep down they are against this person or whatever so i don't think it's such a bad idea to think about so
exactly
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
i didn't think they were either i thought the sentencing was done by the judge and it's either guilty or not guilty
changes
um-hum
oh sure yeah
exactly
yeah
yeah
um-hum
exactly
uh-huh
yeah
kind of how i you knows in certain cases i can see them going just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict
simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small
maybe you did a crime that was
burglary or whatever and it goes into the court case or whatever and it's not highly publicized but when you get into these highly publicized cases
where everybody knows details whether it's through the national enquirer or whatever
it's the idea that person might initially have this thought well jeez this person's guilty no matter what i'm not gonna listen to the facts or and
con their way into getting past the lawyers and getting through that but also there's the aspect of cost and i i'm not quite sure how much cost it does
take for the judicial system to try and call a jury whether it's very costly or if it's something that's not costly or what
you know being that i'm not in the that area i really don't know but i wonder
if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial
and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work or at give them the time off
from work whether it i think it's with pay if i remember jury duty is with pay
and it's not it
hm
paid right
um-hum
some that may decide not to
hm
well i'll just briefly i worked in a nursing home so i kind of know from way back how things used to be run and i think there's been definite changes of nursing homes but
i think if i personally had to put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off
where somebody comes in and they cook meals and they clean their house for them that kind of thing so they still have their own independence and not reliable you know they don't have to be in a nursing home situation but
i don't think the nursing homes when i was working in them were very much understaffed very much in need of good personnel
i think the patients weren't given the quality of care that i wouldn't have you know i look at it and say thank god i
got out of that kind of situation but they were not given the time and they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help and
i can remember lifting a patient all by myself simply because there was not another person to help it's either let leave the patient in bed all day long
so i think nursing homes are have changed i'm not quite sure but hopefully they have
um-hum
yeah
sure
um-hum
sure
yeah i think that's that can happen and i think in the nursing home that i worked for
i wasn't quite sure of it but i'm sure that some of the patients were given medication to keep them in quiet and
yeah and they would just lay all day long and
the ones they also put mentally ill patients
in the same they were not on the same you know ward but they were in the same nursing home so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other older people that were in there for reasons of
you know age the mentally ill patients could walk right in into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing they could they had freedom to just walk around and a lot of them were
i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic and i remember one time watching one of the schizophrenic patients actually go out on i don't know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say it but
she grabbed a hold of this and it was kind of funny when i look back at it but i mean i remember the patient getting very upset
that woman actually pulled the other person's hair i mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair you know and it was a guy that was
just really upset i mean he's what the hell are you think you're doing you know and i laughed at it then but then i'm thinking god you know if i had to put my parents in that nursing home i wouldn't want them there
so i think there's laws now that kind of protect that nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people
and not in the same type of facilities even though they're aging mentally ill they are still mentally ill and a lot of these older people have their you know
they're not insane or anything like that they don't have these tendencies to lash out
a small town
yeah
i don't know
i don't know i kind of look at it this way i think
if you have a big city area i think there's more people to keep watch on it
and yeah and you have more competition and i think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community
and this is back in nineteen seventy seven that i worked there
and i look back at it and say jeez you know i it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there but my grandmother later on got cancer and could no longer well actually she
do you afternoon shows mainly then
yeah my kids love to watch cartoons and i have to come in the other bedroom to watch jeopardy and such what are some of your favorite sitcoms or whatever at night
yeah pretty good
um-hum
um-hum
you don't have a real favorite or
and we
we enjoy it mainly because it i think it has it's full of adventure and stuff like that
but the last couple we wondered if the kids should watch with and tonight's or tomorrow night's sound pretty bad too so
but we watch and la law is another one we probably watch if we can
and quantum leap we have our favorites of course i don't know what channel they're all on probably different ones
they tried to get tickets and man the scalpers that were out wanted a hundred and fifty per ticket
yeah i just read in today's paper where the dynasty sequel out rated the world series that really surprised me
i didn't think i didn't care to watch that dynasty at all i guess it depends on if you're a dynasty fan or not
it will be interesting to see how many keep with it
see if it was really that good or not but
yeah
no i watched dallas at when it first came on and then i lost interest in it too
and dynasty i just never did get into so but well i think that's all we need to discuss we have a few similar not too many and
now i'll have to watch one of yours and see if i like it so all right it was good talking to you bye-bye
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
oh no
then that's a good thought
um-hum
but
yeah and they don't i know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their they've parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and
crime but we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the anywhere that they live has had been a victim of you know a serious crime
but it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe and
and there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to but it is scary
were you raised in this area
hm
um-hum
um-hum
right
that when we moved here from houston not too long ago and so of course we were interested in schools and
but the schools in houston all have big tall fences around them and they're not really very safe
and in houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school
pretty scary
but anyway well i guess i won't take up more of your
uh-huh
well
uh-huh
yeah
yeah it it's too bad you mentioned your in-laws place as being like a prison in sense of hard to get into or out of or whatever
it's just
actually i'm in a suburb of dallas where it's
safer in general than it is in the big city
it
i think it's like most cities and that is the high crime areas are the
ones where there's more poverty
whether it's the bronx or whether it's a certain area in dallas or whatever
i think that's where the crime is concentrated but gosh we just there was just one over in fort worth a woman was killed and her husband was badly injured
and they've charged the husband's daughter
with hiring two of her teenage friends to kill her
dad and stuff yeah
isn't that incredible and i mean that that's crime that's
that you don't usually think about i mean you if you if you're going to carry on a conversation about crime you know you think of the hardened criminal that keeps
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh no
hum
oh ho
well if you had to pick a type of music that you like would you be able to
country music
i
are you from texas
not where you from
i'm kind of in a different category here
i would probably go with it's tough
i think i would just stick with the classics only because
i like music just for music's sake and
you know i'm from the era where you know we had all the rock and roll i'm forty so i'm you know part of that whole deal and
that was a real interesting time and you know the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound
but i think i'd stick back with my beethoven and my bach and my mozart
i mean because it's just it will always be there it's classic and i don't have to worry about you know what's current and what's not because i haven't been current with music for a long time but you know same
and as far as country music is i've never really listened to it i mean because that's just it was it wasn't part of what i knew so
right yeah
i it's a different perspective on everything too i know well whenever they talk about
country music it's about it seems sad to me it's always about some guy losing some girl and then
yeah well i must say though i listen to amy grant do you consider her country
let's see well name some people that are country that i should listen to
that would be good
okay
oh okay i must admit that's yeah they're fantastic so
she's something though she's got so much energy
let's see well i guess i have
listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that i do like some of that dolly parton she's kind of is she kind of country
right down there
how about the oak ridge boys
very much okay well i like them too so i guess i've had a smattering and i just
and i've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because i just don't understand it but maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which i really like so
yeah the greatest hits right yeah
yeah so i mean it it'll if it stands the test of time we'll see
and then it'll if it survives then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of hey listen what we listened to can you believe this sort of thing but
you know i think of i get real tickled when i listen to some of the old beatle music you know the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still and
yeah so it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff but i don't know well you got any more
well
that's
okay bye-bye
i'd go to the weight room and get in every part of my arms and work on legs
but now i'm training to run and i fun run here in tyler and it's just two miles but i'm up to running a mile so i walk real fast for two miles which takes me about thirty minutes
but most of the time it's fun
huh
no in college and the junior college i'm going to right now has a really good fitness center
and so they have a cardiovascular room where they have a stairmaster
and sometimes i do that i kind of got burned out on the stairmaster and they have a real good weight room and i do a lot of free weights free weights more than machines i enjoy those more
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah it's pretty difficult for me too but i've got one month to train for the two mile run i'm fixing to do
and i'm running to get in shape yeah i'm in i'm in really good shape now but i've only been seriously in a workout program since september
so i'm knocking close on a year just to be you know you know almost but i'm just i really i had a partner last semester in school that was into body building and he'd been in it for about three years
but i got started into that and i ended up gaining almost ten pounds from muscle
just in well i had a bigger appetite too so i actually i lost size
but i gained in weight you know because of muscle but now i'm trying to get rid of some of the bulkiness
you do a lot less weight and a lot of repetition so that's what i'm working on now
well i go monday through friday i walk and run but
but
uh-huh
uh-huh
ooh
right
yeah
do you live in the mountains
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
do you have any kids
oh my goodness
you get a little of exercise in on that
most of it is tv
yes i do we get a daily and then i get the wall street journal also
it's the charlotte observer
um-hum
yes right
and the wall street journal gives financial news and other information i'm interested in
yes but it's usually after the fact as far as the major topics because most of the other has been on tv don't you agree
yeah
oh i think during the middle east crisis there was a problem in terms of too quick to try to get a scoop and not checking facts out and i think that's probably a good relevant
fear of all of it yeah i didn't see a movie a long time ago but it was about the news team that
tried to influence the world and i have a feeling that they're much more into themselves sometimes than they are into what the world is ready to hear they create news
yeah i think so too
and radio is sort of a catch up in fact i was listening to the radio the other day and that they were reporting on the condition of an of an accident victim
and i had already seen on the news about an hour before that accident victim had died but the radio news report was that he was still in intensive care so it's one of those
it the most immediate is tv the others are catch up and fill in
uh-huh
how do you feel the newspapers there in colorado springs treats local interest news
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think about other topics too i i'd like to go to a city and sort of look at the front page and find out what is going on in that city but it's always the national information that you have to flip through to find out
anything special about the city and i think that's
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh right yeah that's true what type of work are you in
okay that is a news worthy company in itself so you're you would be interested in any news related to it yeah
oh i'm consulting right now i'm in between jobs so it makes it makes a difference i'm interested in many more industries than i used to be just in terms of looking around so it
i've been in the oil and gas business and then higher education and done a few other things including international accounting so
yeah i understand that i was in oklahoma so i know the area very well
yeah
oh yes they'll tell you a lot that's important but the trouble is the value do you watch sixty minutes and some of those other
i
and as far as affecting a national audience i wonder sometimes
uh-huh
yeah
no
but i do enjoy we are here temporarily i enjoyed having cnn so that i could tune in the news any time i wanted to and not wait for network broadcasting
okay it's a good addition because i think they're
they have a lot of news obviously all the time and there's not the pressure then
uh-huh
yeah
the
oh i think it too is under pressure
uh-huh oh yes it was there are games played
psychological warfare is a big factor all the way around
it's been it's been a big factor for many years but this is the first time we have seen it so quickly and so close up
it
uh-huh
uh-huh
denver paper okay
uh-huh
yeah i think all the truth is the big issue they obviously had to be telling a lot of truth because they were there reporting firsthand but in terms of
yeah
did you just switch back and forth between programs
uh-huh
i think they withhold when it's advantageous both sides both sides and i think when norman announced afterwards on the barbara walters show
yes that he knew you know what to expect out of saddam hussein
that he was playing games you know and they both were i think that's all part of warfare is to play games
yeah
yeah
yeah well let's hope we don't have to go through that again
oh yes oh yes
of government agencies and companies be tested especially when it effects public safety i mean the military obviously people that run trains and airplanes and the like
for others i don't know i don't feel as strong about it i don't really don't have any objection to it but i can't really say i'm for it either what's your feeling
uh-huh
yeah
i i've been in two situations where i've had to under go grug drug testing i was in the military for a number of years
and then i worked for four years as a as a an electrical inspector
in a nuclear plant that was under construction and in both cases you know we were subject to random testing for drugs
and i know a lot of people refused to a lot especially at the nuclear plant or would you know strongly object to it but you know i could see the need for it so i went along with it
i think if i were a clerical worker for instance though and really couldn't have effected anybody else i'm not sure that i'd
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um-hum
uh-huh
right
right probably alcohol has more of an effect for a shorter period of time
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum so they were doing it just to they wanted to make sure that their employees were productive probably that's
that's probably why they justified it
no i'm just trying to imagine why they would wanna test you
right
right
yeah i think that people who do something that could hurt somebody else
should be subject to the testing i guess that's probably the way i'd term it and i'm talking about bus drivers as you mentioned and pilots and what have you
others that really can only hurt themselves shall we say
are you in the market for a car recently
oh what'd you get
uh-huh what convinced you to get that one
um-hum
oh incredible how many miles on it
and it's still running real well
oh great yeah we have right now we have two cars i have my husband and myself we have two sons who are drivers
and one of which is a an eighty eight plymouth voyager van and then we have about a year ago we picked up a second hand audi
and that was a you know a sedan and we got that i don't i'll
the major things the reason why we got that is we had a nova and a well my son was driving and someone came into his lane and hit
him and fortunately he was able to his i mean he was checked out of the hospital was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totaled
and mike and they had been my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car
so i mean i got i was getting really nervous so i finally said we i want a really solid car
so we found the audi second hand i guess right now my criteria for cars is being solid able to take an impact
and so i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car
but the things that i would want would be a solid car another thing i'd definitely want would be antilock brakes
our van which is a delight to drive does not have i think the brakes on the plymouth van is just are terrible
if the road is at all wet and i'm and i don't go all that fast but the it just doesn't hold it doesn't hold well at all
so i definitely would want to get antilock brakes so i don't know do you have any particular things that
that are priorities on your list
yeah
i guess down there air conditioning's a must isn't it
uh-huh
that's incredible that is incredible
we get about our the van gets on highways can get about twenty eight the audi does not have good mileage that's the one drawback it's a powerful car
but it does not i mean i if i'm on a highway and i can get twenty one miles in per gallon
i consider that i'm lucky maybe sometimes i've gotten twenty two it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that's a to me is a real drawback i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty eight or
but the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning in this area in washington dc area it gets hot and humid
yeah so air conditioning is definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer but i
i don't need you know power windows are nice but i don't need them
although i must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads come into a toll road push that button down it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up instead of having to crank it
yeah but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to if you're alone in the car just to press buttons and but you know i've lived all these years without them i probably could have lived a little longer
one of the things that we have we've liked when we've gotten a new car and this used car has it is a sun roof
and those are really nice in good weather
so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have antilock brakes i'd love to get an air bag
and a sun roof
and just so it'd be a good solid car i guess that's those are my major criteria everything else is you know a luxury and they make the car more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong
so if you were to buy a new car now a brand new car what would you look for
um-hum
yeah
isn't that true it's funny
that you use the audi's german and i have to say it has been pretty dependable
yeah one advantage of an american made car is if you get stuck anywhere most local garages can fix you up
but once you get if you once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and the parts i know the audi parts are terribly expensive
i mean it i shudder i would not get the audi again just for that reason
but i would love i wish an american an american that you know engineering would make something as solid as a german car
you know we certainly have the technology but it's amazing when we bought this audi i mean everything is more solid in it
you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic
and i know and i and i'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a for a solid car i don't think i have to give up as much as i'm giving up
but do you need air conditioning down there
yeah
oh we've had eleven days in a row over ninety
they've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that
well listen i enjoyed talking with you
okay and enjoy your car
thank you too it's going to be a hot one okay bye-bye
uh-huh it is isn't that against well in is that is that within the law in virginia
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
how old are your kids
okay
um-hum
right
so like prefab school
the four year old
oh uh-huh
yeah
sure i imagine it really was because see you had to run at least three separate curricula in parallel and uh-huh
right
how long did you do this for
three years okay
um-hum
oh so every year your kids had to do like some kind of a test to be sure that okay
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
oh you mean you didn't have to take them to like a central location
oh they sent them oh boy yeah um-hum
uh-huh
yeah well what did you think about like you know you obviously paying taxes for the for schools did i mean
right
you didn't worry about it what eventually you put your kids back in back in to public school how did that
hello
hi my name's gail i'm calling from texas
oh what a deal
yeah seems like they take forever any more but so did you hear what the topic was did she tell you okay
great well if you're ready then i'll just go ahead and start okay hold on
okay well i guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women
seems like
to me everything is just
you can't keep up with things
any more and everything is there everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women i personally i'm a stay home mom and i like it the way it used to be
are you
yeah
um-hum
yeah
how many kids do you have two are they young or
five and two i have two and mine are two and nine months
so being home is real i just am fortunate because i don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home
and i just it's just weird that i was just talking to somebody this morning who's a working lady a working mom and
you know these people have secretaries and these high power jobs and it just seems like she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care
and i just think i
i just don't agree with that i think it should be
that people should get back to staying home and
and being family more family oriented than not
you know it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other and i hope it just doesn't get to where
you know there's more women more and more women going into the work force
yeah
um-hum
yeah well i find that i whenever i have to whenever i'm in a group of people and we're discussing things like just over the weekend i visited my family and some cousins i hadn't seen in a long time and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing
and you know well i had my baby with me and i found that all i talked about was my baby which was fine with me but it's like you know here these people are they're going to school getting degrees making all this money and you know they kind of looked at me like i was
i mean you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while
in social situations sometimes
which is too bad because you know
every day
but you know i don't know
he's kind of a
at least here i've noticed i'm not from here i'm from colorado
but i've really noticed that there are a lot of a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home and
at least in the circles i've traveled and in the church that i go to you know that men don't treat you like you don't know anything generally
speaking
yeah
yeah
yeah i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem
definitely
well this is getting to be similar to the reason i moved away from saint louis all these gray gloomy rainy days you know
but i've been here for about well it's going on five years now and this is definitely the rainiest january february
yeah
you've been here a while then
oh okay
i would like to get down to oh tampa some place like that where
at least yes
is that down the coast of florida
okay
no i think it's a couple hours drive if i
i see
is that right
maybe
well i'll tell you i will definitely take the hot summers
no kidding
i'll bet you just did all kinds of business
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yes
oh i'll bet
okay
have you did you have you grown up in dallas stephanie
oh where are you from
in germany
well
oh that's neat
uh-huh
my husband had a bicycle tour of europe or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war and so we've seen lots of pictures of the of the beautiful spots and areas
yeah
oh huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
yeah
yeah
when our children were younger we enjoyed we lived up in new york
or new jersey and used to like traveling into upstate new york and camping
and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and
water skiing
but not much of
of anything else
uh-huh
it's got to be the water
when we were in jersey we used to go down to the jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot it's really they had
there's some really nice beach areas there
uh-huh
oh i see
that's a really pretty area too
uh-huh
no
you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and just really and then we weren't too for from the appalachian trail we did quite a bit of hiking
which is kind of fun
are you a you a hiker or not
not so much huh
uh-huh
so your next your plans are try to find someplace to scuba dive
you have any children
okay then that's probably one of the reasons our
we had little children all the time so some of the things are not as quite as adaptable yeah it is
you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy too and so i think
yeah
eleven or twelve i would think probably but maybe fifteen even i know that
came back from grand rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate
from with his master's degree in social work and so that was fun and the summer we have a we have a
a reunion in salt lake area up by park cities
where we're going to camp for a week with
as many members of a rather large reunion group that as we can get together so
yeah
yeah
we we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could
stop and sleep maybe you know like a
yeah so you could kind of sleep in it
sometimes but you wouldn't want to do it all the time
we have enough friends here and there i would just love to just drive
through the united states and stop and see people i know and visit for a day and then go on and you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah i think it
i think that would real and i would like to maybe not take great long trips but have your home base where your home is
and then just travel out for like maybe oh
a month maybe go
and
yeah
yeah there are a lot of neat places to visit in america that's for sure we've i haven't been much to the south i haven't been in georgia or florida
or mississippi or alabama i guess that's those are the only states i have not visited but
johnstown and in that area is just really neat interesting things to so you know
yeah we took a trip around to the civil war
battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something i believe it was had about three kids then i think but that was a really fun interesting trip i
we read bruce catton's book before we went you know and so we were ready to look up the places we read about it was really interesting
yeah
yeah
yeah
well now camping is fun with kids
i mean i find
yeah i find the outdoors very relaxing and you know kind of
a change
yeah okay see you later bye-bye
okay well personally i don't have any children i'm twenty two and i'm doing my master's at nc state so children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now
so what how do you spend the time with your children
oh
okay and they
yeah
what are you doing
oh okay do they play like does the eight year old play baseball
okay and in his league do they have like a pitcher or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what
okay
oh okay
yeah i used to play soccer when i was that age up in new york so
yeah and how about how about like on the weekends do you do sports or do you go out
do you go how about like for do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off
in the summer or like in the easter time like around now
and where do you go
have you been out of the country
oh okay well first they always say get to know your country first before you leave i mean i lived in places like when i lived in washington dc i never went to the washington memorial and then when i went back to visit i went to the washington memorial
right
yeah did like did you go to disneyland
oh okay so but now i don't know but let's see when i was eleven i went also to the caribbean
that was fun that was and then after that i my sister lives in turkey so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to turkey and this christmas i went to turkey but basically
it's for the past couple of years i since my parents are well i'm from argentina and my parents live down there so all the traveling i do is alone
and we were never much of a very family thing you know may like go skiing in vermont or something
yeah
yeah
well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things and
and to me you know it's like now i'm twenty two but i still feel you know it's like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up and he wants me now he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it's very
hard for me because you know it's like you grow up to be twenty years old and it's always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old
and he wants to be best friends but you know it's like
i can only express myself so much because you know of everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i'm sorry you know it's like
you know i love you and let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it you know
and so that's that the thing that you know its like when like i've seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together and you know his kids are you know when his little girl was five years old and everything
they would go to the beach and she could go to sleep at two in the morning
you know and i was brought up the same way if it doesn't matter what age you have if just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his work from his house
yeah
yeah
yeah but it's just it's just something that you know my theory is you know when you have kids and all you want to do well what i'll do is you know it like
i mean you might have a problems but it's not your kids problems you know and you got to try to be with them as much as you can and to you know like thing is that you know like if
if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem
you know and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem you know
and that's very that's very hard to do because once you're best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better
yeah
yeah my father was raising four oh well three kids before he had me so it was
you know you're trying to support four kids and it's pretty hard you know and i and i told them listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids
yeah
but you know like four i mean four children is expensive especially when you consider like especially for me which i'm paying out of state tuition i'm paying you know three thousand no what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester
and you know people say you know it's expensive for to send kids to college but if an everybody would be a little bit responsible you know it's like what does it cost it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose that they go to a state college and they live at home
you know and well it costs two hundred dollars for books
but you know seven hundred dollars a semester a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like
i mean it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know
oh excuse me
well i i'm doing computer science computer engineering
yeah and now i'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home
because since i'm an international student they want to send me back to argentina well my dad wants me to go back so
no because if you go back there then you can never get out
like you don't have any money to get out
so and i was thinking you know like oh my god you know i go back there and then and then i might get married there and then i will have kids there and then i'll never leave the place you know
yeah i know and that's what happened to my brother he came to school up here and then when he went down there he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that
his life just went down the drain so
yeah i i've been calling a lot of companies there some of them are interested well at least for a year and a half i can work so
i'll do it
all right same here bye-bye
ready to talk okay
i want to talk about our family budget and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little bit
tell me how yours work
well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are we're on the east coast now
my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to north carolina
and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget
and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought was realistic and
so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently
well we actually planned for about one year
and what we did was just decide how we had been spending our money before
and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and adjusted where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down
but
oh just our own design uh-huh
and so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked
we spent too much money until our children went to college so
so tell me about do you all have a budget
yes
three and a two year old bang
um-hum
well i think that's important for your budget to be for it to work though you have to do something
of course not
well i found that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned
but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents
we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before
and i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your friends
yes
well i really do i think you have to budget those things though
yes
exactly or know so much per month anyway
well but i do realize that is realistic for some people and it was for us many for many years
and if and if that's the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the year then doggone it that's what you should do
um-hum
well i was just reading an article in
a north carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at
letters of applications to universities
she was oh she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done
where there's a will where there's a will there's a way right
well i have enjoyed talking to you
bye-bye
well ah even though it's totally out of my ah my degree training i've been working as in the horticultural
but i don't know i guess growing up on the farm and that i i've always had a big interest i have a
when i have an area to do i always had a big garden and
enjoy working on lawns and everything
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
huh
um-hum
right yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well and that's their gardening there so i guess as long as you can have ah some grass there
so i know i was in
houston and i was working for a company once and we were taking care of lawns out there and that particular year they had just tons of rain it was raining continuously
and then i know with all that moisture a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems
um-hum
are you able to get sometimes a double crops of certain things in your garden
oh
uh-huh
yeah we haven't had to take anything back although i wonder you know if they
and my phone is making a weird noise
refrigerator and washer and dryer and all that and so far we haven't had any
any major problems haven't had although i keep hearing noises this morning that make me wonder if our washer is about to you know
oh uh-huh
huh
um-hum
oh
um-hum
hum
oh
um-hum
um-hum
wow what a
yeah
um-hum
right
we haven't had to have anything fixed like that although we do my husband orders a lot from land's end catalog
yeah we've had real good luck with them for the most part but they have changed their sizing somewhat and because i had ordered a women's blouse and i wear about a six but i usually like to order the next size up
and i had ordered a one of those little polo shirts
and it's really pretty small and i hardly ever wear it but so i was trying to decide what size to order this time and i went ahead and ordered the same size
and it is like two sizes larger i mean it i love it because it you know now they make things a little bit bigger to where they are not as fitted you know but my husband ordered oh he orders pants dress shirts
so eric what do you think
that
yeah
so you think that they that those products should cost more
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
wow um-hum well do they i mean i never liked doing that and i didn't up until several years ago when it came down to the point of
you don't have a choice you know if you if you need to have a car then you have no choice and
and it gets even worse when you think about trying to do things like buy a house
yeah i did it's just that
there needs to be some change take place so that the inertia can begin to go in a different direction and strike down
you know that's the problem that i think we have
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
well we were we were in debt before that it just wasn't as apparent
somehow we still
i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were eventually going to pay us back
and that hasn't happened
um-hum
oh that's true i hadn't thought of it that way i think
yeah that's true
yeah that's true
yeah
yeah in some in some cases it i think it's actually going to you know the people that it's intended for in other cases
and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government that's in control now in some cases the money actually does filter down to the to where it's
supposed to get to and in other cases it does not
yeah
yeah
i don't really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for that i know that they're trying to be they're that they're supposedly trying to be fair with taxes and by making it more equal
but
i can't really understand why
it has to be the same percentage where you have someone that makes
a very low amount of money the same percentage may affect them thirty five or forty times more severely than the same percentage
of someone's well -f if they earn a great deal of money and i would being somewhere in the middle feel like that it would be a lot more fair to have a little more heavily weighted
toward the top end if i can put my you know i think to myself if i had that much money
i could afford to pay more taxes it wouldn't bother me a bit
yeah they used to have and what do they i don't know what the percentage is now they used to be taxed thirty percent
and i remember hearing an interview with who was it the man who invented hawaiian tropic
you know and he was talking about that he was talking about nobody went broke over paying thirty percent
you know
well that's
they get it depends on how you look at that because like sweden they pay a lot in taxes but their day care is government subsidized
women who want to stay home with their children are subsidized to do that they don't have to live
hand to mouth because it the government there and the country there has placed a very significant value on motherhood
um-hum i think we could learn some things from and the and the health care system you may pay more in taxes but your health care is taken care of and you don't have the corruption and in
medicine that we have here with the outrageous charges and
hum
yeah
yeah i think that if we could model
you know programs after those that are already i mean they did a lot of work finding a program that worked and if we were to do the research take under advisement what they have
already working and adapt it
that particular day care system works very well and the canadian health plan is probably the best one in existence today
hum
yeah
um-hum
have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are
right yeah on the on primarily on soft drink pop and that kind of thing
it's fairly extensive but again it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
well actually there's
there's the opportunity for both
the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed a deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
central well i want to say central canada but central canada tends to be referred more to ontario and quebec
but
there's psychological pressure against
employing people to do that kind of thing although
scouts and
hockey teams and ball teams those kinds regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collecting the bottles at individual homes
but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting newspapers they're actually at
virtually all of the shopping centers like the shopping malls there are several containers where the group called cosmopolitan industries
collects or people can drop their used newspapers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected
some of the
i'm bridget
it's nice to meet you
i'm in lubbock
okay good you ready for me to push one then okay
so what kind of clothes do you wear to work
uh-huh
are you
okay well this is kind of a hard topic because i don't work
no i'm in college so
but i think
pardon
yeah
but i think if i was going to go to work and stuff i think a dress or more like a suit would be more appropriate for sure
um-hum
yeah doesn't get that hot
i don't know i can't i would i wouldn't like to have to wear a suit every day though i wouldn't like that at all
yeah
with dress clothes
i honestly i don't know because
i haven't had to wear that many dress clothes yet to be honest you know
i really don't think i don't even i couldn't even tell you
but i would say i don't know
really do you wear really dressy dresses to work
do you oh okay so you go all out and everything
yeah well that would be important though i mean you would have to
uh-huh
i bet you couldn't
i usually get like i usually get nike
with shoes and stuff like that
i'm real big my feet get real sore real easily so i have to have really well padded shoes
uh-huh yeah i love sweaters
yeah because it gets really cold up here i mean you get the turtle neck sweater jacket thing a lot
so i mean i would say mostly like now it's like you could wear like a t-shirt or sweat shirt because it's usually chilly in the morning but it's warmer at night
it's a lot different because i i'm from dallas
yeah i think it's a lot colder than it does in dallas that's for sure with all the snow and everything
yeah because i because i am from dallas and i live in richardson so
i mean it gets cold there but it's not cold like it gets here and i think here it gets cold and it gets windy you have a you know wind chill at twenty miles an hour and it gets like bitter cold
and you have to walk across campus and stuff so you really wear a lot of clothes i mean everybody has on like gloves and scarves and ear muffs and everything
uh-huh yeah
hum i have like one and i wear it when i dress up
yeah i probably will go to graduate school because i want to be a marriage counselor
but i'll still need nice you know whatever i do if i do that or if i go into business then i'll still need dress clothes like nice dresses and nice suits and stuff like that
that's what i plan on waning wearing to work when i go to work
to the
okay well
well i'm i work at a large company and
we have quite a quite a few benefits and we have
the best benefit i like is the amount of vacation time especially after working there for a long time it really build up to the amount of vacation time i
i think that's one of my best benefits
wish in a big company there's more bureaucracy and
less support of
what you're doing i think and that's something that
is probably and a benefit of a smaller company you get more support from the people that you work for
yeah
you're really thinking of the future
yeah
yeah
i work for the state of florida and it's pretty good retirement plan
we don't get paid very much but
retirement plan is pretty good
yeah
did you say you work for a credit union
okay
yeah my wife used to work for a credit union group they had a newsletter that went out to all the
all the credit union ceos and people like that so she was really into the keeping up on what's going on with the credit unions
it was it was a company i think it was called credit union news or something
it was based out of
i think it was boca raton florida
yeah it was pretty
pretty glossy kind of
newsletter that comes out
nah
yeah just i get what you give in
that's
not
with not too many choices
yeah
yeah
yeah i guess
yeah
yeah
okay well
okay
okay bye
oh yes very appropriate i guess
you ready for this
okay john just a moment
uh-huh
oh you do so you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather and imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather
that it's gonna break all kind of records that were set back since nineteen thirty two
oh yes so we're gonna
uh-huh
wow
well so are you an airline pilot
oh great
with southwest fantastic i have a brother i have a brother that's a pilot also with american
yes and so i imagine you
oh with all this kind of weather it's makes it kind of dangerous for you
oh i guess so yeah
um-hum
oh yes well we moved actually down here from another location and it's spectacular the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain
pardon me
i've never seen a thunder show like i've seen down here before in texas
lights up the whole sky and even on a on a actually i've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky it's a cloudless night
and the rain isn't falling but you can see the thunder and excuse me see the lightning going horizontally across the sky and back and forth and what a light show it's fabulous
yes that's true
i'm from northern utah and that's a very arid climate from salt lake city area
and there's always a lot of snow in fact where i grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to twelve different major ski resorts
and so there was an awful lot of snow and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow
which made it fantastic for skiing and
and sleigh riding and everything else so we had a great time and
yeah
in a
in snowbird and solitude and
and brighton and yes all those areas so i imagine have you skied before
um-hum
um-hum
oh yes oh yes
yeah great well do you think this the weather is typical for this time of the year
yes yeah
yeah it's been it's been cold there was a time though in the middle part of november that got really cool really unseasonably cool
that's a fun yeah my wife was just listening here and she said yeah it froze in fact
and but i've really enjoyed the weather down here too because two years ago we were the day after christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather
and it's not as severe i should say as the weather that i've experienced up in northern utah
i have a brother-in-law that lives in minnesota and they say boy six months out of the year it's bitter cold and
and the wind and the blowing snow and everything it's
um-hum
so
how do you feel about capital punishment
huh
yeah i have no idea what the law is anywhere i've ever lived i just
i don't know so
i personally even though
i understand the principle behind capital punishment i don't agree with it ever applying capital punishment to anyone
because i sort of believe that if we've got a person arrested that sure we can we can say you know it's a murderer he's done heinous crimes
but we can keep him in jail for the rest of his life and not give him a terribly pleasant existence
and there's just no reason to justify killing a person you know there may be an economic reason but i don't think that's sufficient to justify killing someone
if you believe that killing is wrong you might as well apply that to you know even that stays true even if you're punishing someone i know that's how i feel
yeah
it's just that i feel like they don't really pose a threat if they're imprisoned you know sufficiently and
you know i guess it would be bad if the politics ever changes and they got out for some reason but
yeah
oh yeah
but the thing is you know when these guys get out it can be so quiet you may not notice i mean if the public doesn't hear about it
for some reason i mean the thing is charles manson was really publicly well know but
if it's somebody who's you know a serial killer but he never was really in the media a lot then when he gets out he still won't be in the media
yeah so i you know
it could be bad if somebody got out i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
well there have to be because
i don't know there's like
well i don't know the numbers but i mean there's at least dozens of capital punishments every year
from what i that's what i think it is
and you know you don't hear about all of those
uh-huh
right yeah i don't know either
so
right
yeah
they're against capital punishment
oh okay
aren't do a lot of countries not have capital punishment
that'd be interesting to find out who doesn't
yeah
right
right
we eat out quite a bit it's just my husband and i at home now so
oh at least once a week
uh-huh
well what type of restaurant do you like richard
right
oh have you we like chinese we eat a lot of chinese food
uh-huh
what do you look for in a restaurant
you what you
right
i know what you mean i like some ambience and
uh-huh
uh-huh
right uh-huh i don't care to go to a place just
for the price of it huh
i mean it's continental french restaurant or something really
with high prices and seven courses isn't what i usually look for
uh-huh
presentation and
well like
we we've been eating some in a restaurant that just changed hands recently and we're trying to give them a little patronage but
sunday we went there and i had a
pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple
and potatoes
yeah that's what i mean by right uh-huh
it would mean a lot to the looks of the plate
tex-mex
right i know
right
uh-huh
right uh-huh that's true
i'm originally from maine so we like seafood too and that's something we don't get here and we're in the mountains in virginia
and most of the seafood's frozen
right
uh-huh true lots of shrimp
i know it
oh yes yeah it's like
two ninety eight a pound for a pound lobster
yeah
oh yeah or cheaper right yeah a lot of the restaurants you can get
two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety nine
yeah it's a good place to go
lots of little restaurants too with home cooked food that up there
yeah
right uh-huh
uh-huh
we went to
we were in galveston last year right well the first of this year actually
and ate in a restaurant and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the gulf coast
no it wasn't on the way across louisiana we pulled off we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place
and they had it was a small restaurant just kind of out of the way
and they were set up with two buffets one for their regular sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything and then one complete seafood buffet
that was the best shrimp i have ever had in my life they had shrimp fixed probably six different ways
uh-huh right it was wonderful
uh-huh
i tried it but i didn't care for it not there but at my brothers i tried it
that's probably true it
i wasn't hungry it wasn't a meal we just he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them just so we'd try them
quite a bit
oh
right
we used to do that once in a while but we don't anymore
do you well that makes a difference
where do you go to brunches like hotels or
restaurants there
oh yeah uh-huh
we eat at shoney's
oh
uh-huh that sounds nice
right i imagine it is
uh-huh
out of which direction out of which direction from there west uh-huh
yeah
how about you
yeah i
yeah i recently moved here and when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the in the worst areas of town and my husband was what he his concerns were well not that i think you'll get involved in anything but it just
be an innocent bystander just to be in that location and i thought how sad it was that just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time and a lot of kids you know are caught that way
but
uh-huh
yeah that
exactly what happened down here
uh-huh
i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime and it doesn't seem like anything is working
but in on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full we can't at least in this area you know they don't have any room to put anybody so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because there's no they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have
uh-huh
i know it they have all sorts of rights that you know are questionable maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes
that's true maybe the punishment should be more severe
i know it
yeah
exactly because they get involved in things so young that they don't really realize what they're involved in
and some people prey on that you know they'll take kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen
and get them involved in things because
well i don't know i was watching on a movie on tv i don't know how true those can be but you know they one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen to steal cars and everything
so i guess if they had more of a deterrent if they had more severe punishments it might be but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial
uh-huh
it's true they and they talk about too the gangs
spreading you know like everybody thinks of them only in la and new york but they spread out
to cover more area and i don't know if gangs occur much down in texas do they
yeah the same in some of the areas around here but i've never had any personal you know i never met anybody that i knew had anything to do with it or seen anybody but
that's a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group and i think that a lot of people that sort of control them
control what they're doing are older you know business you know trying to control whatever you know
uh-huh
it's true and the weapons my god the weapons that people have are some people are seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military i don't know where they get them
uh-huh
that's the other thing is
it's hard to even i can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on and you're putting your life on your on the line everyday
i
yeah i just read an article yesterday where this what used to be a nice town in this area
massachusetts is broke right now and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy and they had to cut twenty guys from their forces and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well
and so it's like
okay i hope things look up
maybe a little bit young to remember the i'm twenty two so i don't think i remember the
you know the height of the cold war and whatnot but i
i don't know i don't consider the soviet union a threat in that by any means just because of the fact that there's not anything that they have to threaten us with anymore
exactly that's true that's
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
sure yeah
no
right
right
i'm not so concerned about an organized danger
maybe for the maybe for the simple reason that
i'm not sure that all of that capability is organized anymore i mean you know just along with it with the dissolution the that the of the
um-hum
right
right
yeah sure
uh-huh
i think i see your point you have you have where once you had one government controlling a large number of missiles now you have several
smaller governments highly volatile
militaries yeah sure
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
do you see
yeah
right
um-hum
provoke anger in the soviet union and what would those what would those steps be
provoke a threat
um-hum
you know both i guess
um-hum
okay we're going to talk about our lawn and garden chores do you have either one
do you
oh really
so do i would i had rather be outside than inside any day
do you work during the week outside the home
uh-huh
yes
or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight
well i unfortunately am not gardening this year i love gardening in fact
i was presented at like no about thirty years ago with a life membership from the richmond virginia counsel of garden clubs
and it wasn't because i was so good but i organized a very large garden club but i still have
it well it's always something that seems so odd to me but
yes it had really nothing to do with actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that it was just that i happened to organize this group that was about seventy people
that isn't yeah that those numbers were great but it
yes
well and actually i think that most women's garden clubs that i've been aware of in the past
are only flowers what i would we've spent the last twenty years in oklahoma just moved to north carolina
and we were originally of course from this area from virginia but
in north in oklahoma it's the men's garden clubs that i would have wanted to join
and you would have because they do all kinds of gardening and not just flowers like women do um-hum
um-hum
yes i think so too
yes and i have spent the last ten years being a florist
being a florist
until the last couple when we had such an economic slowdown
yeah well tell me what's in your garden this year since i don't have one
um-hum
um-hum
yes do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds
maybe it's
yes um-hum
do you isn't that funny so is my favorite
okay
yeah
yeah well i think it has the best flavor
yes uh-huh well i like them in between i like them in between
the flavor is better i think in between
yes yeah um-hum my mother
well and i no i love them well that's the yankee way but i think that's like another vegetable i love them that way just the thrill of
um-hum in fact i my mother who is eighty six years old canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year
yes um-hum yes
yes
and she tends to it herself uh-huh isn't that wonderful
i think so too
yeah
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
no
wonderful bet you showed them
oh
no
yes
um-hum
no october so yes recently seven months and it the weather is wonderful i love it it's just terrific you know rains a little too often
bye-bye
oh
yeah we have in california i'm in i lived in central california we have rain couple times a year and other than that you know it'd be maybe october and then in the spring and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain
so
yeah
yeah there has
so here i know that last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state and i'm glad to see there haven't been any this year
yeah yet still could come huh
uh-huh
yeah
hm
yeah it's so hard to predict here
yeah well today it's not bad out there
um-hum
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah so you do that even in january huh uh-huh
yeah oh that's interesting
um-hum
yeah but i find it humid
right
yeah
i was central california central valley so -t's very dry there
yeah
well it's pretty hot in the summer it's in the usually you know for good three four weeks we have over a hundred degrees but it's a dry heat yeah
uh-huh yeah i know huh well i lived in africa for a couple years in
cameroon and that's a tropical climate and it really feels similar to this during the summer
no i was working with i still work with wycliffe bible translators
it's an organization where we are looking to translate the bible into languages of the world that aren't yet written
right languages that don't have anything written yet so this is like the first thing that's written down or you know first an alphabet is developed and then
so
yeah
yeah well it's based here the international headquarters for wycliffe bible translators is right here in dallas
yeah right now i am so that's what brought me here
yeah
yeah
yeah i agree i agree i
i thought the fall was really nice
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh
um-hum
yeah and you probably do a lot of that with scouts scouting uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
do you really
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's horrible
um-hum
um-hum
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
well in dallas i haven't seen air pollution quite on a quite on a level that we had in denver i grew up in denver and i've lived there most of my life and
we used to have those you know the posted warning days however in colorado now
they have the emissions control law which has really cut down probably only once
every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now you know as far as health concerns due to that the emissions
um-hum
hm
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um-hum
yeah it becomes it maybe to you and i who have grown up in some in
some more beautiful parts of the country i think that we become a little more aware rather quickly of
of what's happening with air pollution and how horrible it really is i notice people in dallas seem to say well sure there's air pollution but you know
really how bad how bad could this problem really be
you right
right
do you find that or do you hypothesize that most of the smog or air pollution comes from vehicles or does it come mostly from industry up there
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum i had talked with my parents i grew up i was born in muncie indiana and grew up a little bit in terre haute and i had asked them before i went back to visit
this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do hand work mostly i do needlepoint i guess
but
oh yeah and it's real neat
and then the at the numbers they they're kind of outlined and stuff it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so
oh what's that
huh
wow well that's interesting what did you what kind of things did you do
uh-huh
oh
yeah
what did you call that
huh that's i've never heard of that before i've probably seen it though i mean when you described it
yeah i mean when you described it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess
but i've never heard of it before and it's really interesting
i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but i've kind of gotten out of that i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows
yeah it is
oh basically bows and lace ribbons i really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i'm not sure how they do it but the ribbons
they make them they like i don't know how to explain it they make them hard you know
yeah
i've never done that and those are so neat i mean i would really like to do those but
oh
oh
yeah
that's i think that's what my concern was you know wasn't really sure and how they would how they would last
i don't i have really have gotten out of it i don't do it quite as much as i used to
i guess because i went back to school so i don't have as much time
uh-huh
i know i started a project
well it's a it's cross stitch and it's a picture and it's a wildlife it has deer and trees and it's really beautiful but it's going to be a lot of work
and you know i've i have worked on it quite a bit but
not as much as i'd like to you know it's just so hard
uh-huh
uh-huh
yep
no that's true i just don't know when i'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it you know it's just really hard
uh-huh and there's so many other things that i
i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i've made a lot of bibs
and wall hangings
and so you know those don't take much time at all so it's no big deal for me to pick those up
and do them
no
no i usually just buy a pattern book i have several pattern books and i just go with those
and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think it's
a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i don't usually use the colors they tell me to and it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters
if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i yeah
yeah
little thumb print and made it a bunny
it was really easy i mean just
just did a thumb print you know
uh-huh
and then see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple and it didn't take anything at all and
uh-huh
um-hum
and then i just
from north carolina
but we're talking about a national topic anyway
yeah
that's the truth and i know that we've just come off a national high with the middle east but now we're facing the same old problems that we had before and that is balancing the budget
i don't know how california's budget is but north carolina's state budget is disastrous right now too
oh my
it
oh california has always been a leader
oh now what was the proposition number several years ago that you voted on for
yes
right
yeah that i think was a smart move i don't know how it's worked out but it seemed very logical in fact it raises one of the issues that i've thought about the national budget
the budget relates to all of us and so does the tax law which usually is an offshoot of the budget process i've often thought
that congress ought not to be allowed to pass any new tax laws say every four or five years instead of every year
an individual has no opportunity individual or corporation or any other business entity has no opportunity to plan long range
oh yeah
to the beginning of
right
that's another thing too i've often wondered seemed to be when i was growing up i learned in civics or government that the house of representatives has to initiate all
tax bills
and i don't think it's working that way kathleen
no what
refresh me
um-hum oh yeah okay
right
that's exactly the point the business or personal budget either one i've
no and when you're not responsible and that's really what it comes down to because you know it a government agency really doesn't care about what the postage rate is
uh-huh
buy something that's right because you are afraid your allocation will be cut the next year and
um-hum
and the mentality was and probably rightfully so because the people devising the budget didn't go back to a zero based budgeting they just did it on the basis of what they spend five percent increase and go on with it
uh-huh and you know grace type waste that you mentioned we see often highlighted in the military and the defense department but it's i'm sure it's widespread to every agency
um-hum
oh yes
i'm surprised it's that low kathleen
oh yes
that's sad and people don't realize it we've become sort of blase about the amount of money because a billion if the government paid a dollar a second
back in the national debt just a dollar a second it would take thirty years to repay a billion dollars now you know that's a long time and that's a lot of money
and when we're talking about trillions
have you
the banking crisis is another case i was reading this week about the fdic saying that they couldn't take on another large bank failure without going to congress
and borrowing and i started thinking now wait a minute they're in exactly the same shape
fdic can't go broke
yeah because you and i will pay for it
i moved here from oklahoma i'm originally from virginia and moved to oklahoma for twenty years and just moved back to the southeast and oklahoma just passed last year
a law stating that or limiting the terms of the state representatives
yeah
it will be interesting to see if we have any impetus to go on to the national
yeah i think so too i get torn thinking about some of the good people all the people i think are good and having to lose them but on the other hand maybe they'll pay more serious attention to the process while they're there instead of the reelection
nobody does
that's right nobody does
all right are you working
editor good
oh i can imagine that whole process is fascinating to me i think i'd like to observe if not participate sometime
um-hum
yes i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico
well i'm i guess
i don't have such close experience with an area becoming a state as you do
my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low standard of living or at least annual average income
part of this i suppose is justified in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need
however in that case i guess i would favor status quo
i have been to puerto rico and found it very interesting i did peace corps training there
and so you know i saw it also as a young student and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in california and so the spanish was no problem
it was
it was you know very lovely and the people seemed very friendly and nice i have actually i work with
a girl from puerto rico and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors
well probably more on in terms of the us
you know i'm not quite sure how the us copes
with this sort of thing i've lived abrode abroad most of my life so
i guess i i've been very cut off i lived actually in lebanon so i was very cut off from the
the press as i you know
and was becoming an adult so i don't know how the us would cope with it a
new state that is so very poor
i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if you consider the inner cities of
like new york and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole new state would require such aid
i think so
um-hum
um-hum yeah those are good points which obviously i'd never thought about
i don't know i suppose
they also not being a state are
probably freer to determine their own
ways of life than they would if
i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
perhaps compulsory education
um-hum well actually i one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that
they've recently voted that spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway
so if they've just taken such action
it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want
to declare this before they become a state
or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish or hispanic heritage
i believe i would probably tend towards that
well that's interesting
right what about if they demanded to have spanish as the official language
as a condition for statehood
um-hum
um-hum
that's interesting because
although i tend to be bilingual spanish based on experience
i was in bilingual education in california and
i didn't have any problem with my students but i noticed my
my brother who was quite a bit younger
was learning spanish in elementary school and he can't speak a word
and so obviously it didn't work in california
right
right
oh i see
um-hum
okay well thank you very much
bye-bye
there is sort of a wide range of camping opportunities i remember when i was a kid my only camping experience was when i was about thirteen or so and it the y camp used to have an overnight every so often
and we'd cut down a couple of saplings or you nowadays you wouldn't cut down saplings i guess
and we'd lash them up which lash was tying and we'd make sort of a triangular thing you know with a tarp over the top
and sleeping bag dug a hole made a fire the old shovel with the toilet paper over it so that i think that's real legitimate camping
just recently my husband and i and our kids joined a friend whose parents has one of the have one of these big silver bullet trailers that stay parked in upstate new york and
i chuckled when i got there was a microwave oven and a gas burner stove and five bunk beds and heat for the evening i mean
yeah but it was so big that you know they don't use it mobilely it just you know you pull it somewhere and you leave it there it's sort of like a summer house i guess and i guess that's camping too
um-hum
oh tell me about it you ready for dayton
right
uh-huh
i think i've heard something about this you go set up a tower right
um-hum
right i mean you know there's not that much free time and i don't know we daydream about going camping i guess there's a very nice state park around here that we're on long island
and there's picnic tables and there's the beach and i guess it's pretty popular it's sort of a lottery for who gets it and you have to apply at the right time and people in the know how do that and we keep thinking about doing it and it
well what do you like to read
you sound like me
if it's printed i'll read it
yeah it's amazing to me the people that i've got a brother and sister-in-law that like whenever i go to visit them i'll always have to be sure and carry a book with me because there's nothing to read in their house and i go crazy
you know
yeah well i went to the library yesterday looking around and i found this new book by pj o'rourke called parliament of horrors and it's about
but anyway he wrote for rolling stone magazine for years and years i think he still does
it is very much a satire
yeah
yeah
most ladies do like mysteries a lot i have i have a friend too is a voracious history buff she just she reads one history
book after another and i was telling her about the library here in houston that has one particular library that has all of the mysteries arranged in one area
and then another one that while they're not arranged in one area they do they have question marks on the covers to indicate that they're mysteries and she said oh that sounds like heaven to her so she wouldn't have to have to look for them
my kitchen counter is covered with newspapers so i finally just you know make a run to the dumpster
but
hm yeah
yeah the only really the only the only day that i just devour it cover to cover is on sunday but that's sort of a ritual with me get the coffee and a bran muffin and the newspaper and
the turn on the stereo and i'm just i'm set for about an hour
well maybe a little more at least an hour at least an hour
yeah
yeah well that's the good thing about the sunday paper though they have so many articles that aren't necessarily you know you don't feel like they're
old if you don't get to them that on that one day
well i don't know i had bought books for years and years and the last time i moved when i was transferred to houston i filled up
one big closet with books because where i live now doesn't have a bookshelf doesn't have doesn't have the book shelves that i had in dallas where i moved from
and i don't know see i've just i've got such so many books and moving them was such a pain that i've really
yeah
yeah but i've got
and one in particular stays open until nine o'clock
monday through friday so it's you know it's great and that makes it you know if they were just regular hours then it would be difficult because i'm
usually work pretty late at the office but
anyway that i still like to go to the bookstores and browse around but
uh-huh
hello
hi nola i'm steve i'm in dallas texas
no that's unusual seems like usually
oh yeah i think all mine have been east coast people so far
so
social changes
what's that mean
yeah
yeah i yeah i definitely i mean there's plenty of things to talk about there that's a
yeah sure
i was hoping that you would but oh
yeah social changes is that
it seems to me that
does
yeah like a lot it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today
so
yeah
it's like people are starting to give up hope and they start out
very poor let's see that's a bad tangent to get on what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties
and the nineties no
yeah
yeah it seems so that yeah that is a pretty big change it seems
even not just single parent families but with no guidance but it seems like
some of these even ladies that that'll work and have a baby and then you know after two or three months go back to work you know well that i mean that's very young for a baby
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i mean they're going to like you said i mean
there's they might be saving money i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term
yeah
yeah
oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment
huh is yeah is the thing how home study is that what you said home school is that is it like a preschool level then or through grade school or
oh is
so you're teaching them completely huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's pretty sad because
i mean
i don't know something's got to change with the schools that's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway when they're young
yeah
yeah
changing people's expectations
hello how you doing i'm lee with i'm over here in plano texas
oh sure
oh
arlington well there's a
stuff going on in arlington these days
are you involved in any of that no
oh you are
oh is that right
uh-huh
in the in the dallas fort worth area
i
i enjoy having the time that i have with my family and
being able to you know work when i want and
uh-huh
oh is that right
yeah
it's a
yeah it yeah i'll tell you what that is the single most benefit that i that i
enjoyed and i do miss because i looked into picking up some medical insurance for my just for my family you know just
and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it
and yeah
oh yeah even at a group rate it's unbelievable and the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids and if you want to add dental to it i mean that's
you know i feel bad for the people that are involved in that
uh-huh
oh really
is that right
is that right
yeah
well really the
oh yeah
yeah
um-hum
oh
well the problem with the rangers is they've got a lot of offense they just don't have any pitching and really haven't had any pitching for years
they're the top offensive team around but
defense and pitching wins your games over the long haul
well that's true but he only comes every five times so
he can't win them all and he's getting a little bit up there
oh yes rollie fingers
well rollie was
you got to be retired for five years to be eligible
yeah we had a game here where
we had goose gossage this year and goose and ryan combine and
they got i don't know ryan got his three hundred something win and at the same time goose got his three hundred and something save and they were you know the same number and they said that it was an unusual occurrence to have that
yeah but he's not coming back
well no they got him at the very beginning of the season but he and the and manager bobby valentine didn't come along so
goose is goose is history
oh yeah he's a he's definitely headed to the hall of fame
but the rangers have you know a pretty good lineup now with the with the addition of the
dickey thorne at short stop that ought to help them but their problem is other than ryan and an occasional flash of brilliance of other people there's just nobody there
well at least he got to play in a championship the rangers have never won the division so
we're obviously not going to last year
yeah i think he's history
he is history
detroit
well they didn't yeah they he went to detroit they really didn't get much for him
yeah they released him and he had to go around trying to sign up with somebody
but he proved to be a total disaster
yeah
yeah he did something he i saw i saw him hit a grand slam once in a game when i was there but i also saw him
drop a ball that cost a couple runs ended up costing the game so he could you know he could be both brilliant and with a bat and just a disaster in the field
it was early on it got better but it was pretty bad at the beginning
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well i have i have a cat that i've had for about eight or nine years
cat's lot easier to take care of than the you can go away and leave her for a few days
yeah i've left her well i've left her alone up to about four days
because she doesn't she's real good she doesn't overeat or anything
and so i can leave food out and know that you know she only eats when she's hungry i know some people have cats that no matter how much you put down they'll eat it all
and then if i'm
if i'm gone longer than that then i'll have somebody come in and you know make sure that she has food and fresh water usually i just leave a faucet dripping in a bowl in the kitchen
and i've even she drinks out of the toilet
uh-huh
well you have to if you don't keep them clean my friend had gerbils and you could smell it as soon as you walked into their to her house
yeah
yeah
yeah can you hold did they let you hold them or
uh-huh
was it are they young do you know how old they are
uh-huh
uh-huh
how old how old are your kids
yeah
they do or my cat does to me like she doesn't like anybody but me in fact no one would know i had her because if anyone comes over she immediately goes into hiding
i had a dog for a while before i had my son and i grew up we grew up having dogs and i'd like to have a dog but
kind of like for the same reasons as you i just the care that goes into them and you know if i you know decide to take off for a week or so
you know i can't leave a dog like i can leave a cat
and plus they require a lot in the way of training and
which now that i'm home would probably be a good time to do it if i were going to do it but
plus they're more expensive to get
now my cat i've had her for eight or nine years
i had her spayed and i had her declawed which you know was an initial expense but
then she has not been sick one day i have never had her to the vet other than just her you know her maintenance stuff
something
and i just i don't need that expense right now plus they eat more and
yeah that yeah i don't know if that's such a big problem here in dallas
my cat stays inside because she's declawed so i don't really have a problem with that but yeah if you had a dog you know they need exercise and you have to walk them
yeah
yeah
you know it gives you some strokes there that you may not get otherwise because i'm cooped up in the house all day
i would like to have what i would really like to have is an aquarium and have some really nice fish
yeah
yeah and now i have some friends who have aquariums and i enjoy
watching the fish and looking in at them you know but that's something that you really i feel that you need to learn about and read about you know you need to learn how to take care of them and you need to learn
with filters and all that stuff that they have now i mean they're almost maintenance free
uh-huh
yeah
well that's good
oh
well that's good yeah that's not bad
i had two i managed i guess when i was in high school or junior high i managed to talk my parents into letting me have a gerbil
do they like to watch him
uh-huh
how many did you get did you get two are they male or female does that make a difference
uh-huh
but you don't really know
oh no
that after they have babies that you have to separate the then you have to separate the male from the female or the male could hurt the babies
yeah
oh no
that's funny
okay well it was nice talking to you
yeah i know my cat she's reaching her life expectancy and i'm already thinking oh no
i see
a good a good southern solution
uh-huh you have to say that
i don't know the things they asked to talk about were whether the
whether the judge should be the one that does the sentencing and seems to me that that's i think that's the way it's done now at least
my understanding of the law which isn't very good
it seems to me that the judge does it and i think that's probably all right in that they
you know maybe know what the
the norm is for a particular thing
right
uh-huh
that's right
and i think that may i that may be an exception as well because i think that doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge
yeah
yes in fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month and
there's a big uproar going on right now the governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not
it was someone who had killed two teenage boys here in san diego as a matter of fact
yeah
uh-huh
something inexpensive
yeah i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years
but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and you'd hate to be one of those
the other thing they asked about was whether
the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again i think is the way it is now that all that all verdicts well maybe not i don't know at least in capital cases i'd think they'd have to be unanimous
uh-huh
yeah the paper here tonight had a thing about the noriega trial and that there's one juror that is different than the other eleven
and they've only deliberated four hours or something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked
yeah six months so far they said so
maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their vote
right
oh really
that's interesting
well have you ever served on a jury
uh-huh
i got called but i never got selected for a jury i sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process and they had
some guy that was defending himself
you know it's i'm a cpa so i use computer quite a bit i'm not sure why they call them sometimes call them personal computers
yeah well actual i think they mean one that's that is
designed or designated dedicated for one person to use primarily as opposed to large mainframe computer
which you know several people maybe use terminals tied to it
i guess that's my definition anyway
right i have an ibm it's one they call the xt
which is one of the earlier models
prior to that i had one that was a heath kit computer which is one that i
basically built myself
yeah and so i've had i've had a computer for oh about ten years little over ten years i guess now
well you heath kit which is you know one of these electronic stores it's a hobby store place
and you can go there and buy a kit or at least you use to be able to i'm not sure that you can still buy those from them now
but you could buy a kit and build a computer it like have a would have a manual step-by-step manual
to go through and put all the parts together
yeah it then it was and of course the computer are so cheap now i'm not even sure how it would how it would compare
back then the computer that i built was one you know was a old pretty low level technology wise
and it cost me oh fifteen hundred dollars i guess to build it
and it would have cost eighteen hundred or so to buy i think so it was you know it was not a great saving but it was a learning experience any way
yeah
not into
right
but you know i had to had to learn a little bit about using a solder iron and that kind of stuff
well i say i said basically i built it myself when i got to a certain point i took it to a ti engineer that was a friend of my wife's and
he you know he worked with help me finished putting it together you know and make it work right it
so you know if you don't know much electronics you can you know you have to have somebody with a little electronic background to make it work but you know the basic stuff i did all the basics any way
no well i use mine at work i don't i don't even have one at the house any more it's i've got it in my office and matter fact i'm in the market for another one
no for my home you know so i mean for my for my office
oh yeah oh
well you can have them connected by a by a modem if you want to which is a telephone line
but you can have the same software you know the same programs
so that you just take your data files from one to the other so that you can use the same computer you know for the for the
a different computers for the same project
so you know it's and that's one thing that i would like to have occasionally i need to work at home you know and now i don't have a computer there so
you know that's i could if i you know if i if i had a computer there so
um-hum
yeah
yeah so
but
right yeah
yeah new cars have computer in them and
no i haven't seen that but i have heard about it but i haven't seen it
yeah but
i don't know i guess the personal computer is it's really going to be a necessity that you know children should learn to use it i was just commenting i teach a couple accounting classes
and i was just commenting the other night that it's
going to reach the point where accounting classes in college have to have computer for the students to use you know in every class right now i teach over at brookhaven college
and there's only one class that i happen to teach that teaches the accounting students anything about using the computer
if they want to use want to learn the computer they have to take classes outside of the accounting area
uh-huh
yeah and but yeah it's that's something that's going to be a necessity for accountants because you know it's you can do so much for more work with a computer then you can do you know doing it manually
and a lot more accurately also
i use the computer to do you know all of my accounting work and of course i write letters on the computer and i do income tax on the computer so it's i use it a lot
yeah you know it's just it would be
if you have a computer you can buy you know some little cheap software that you can buy like at software house here in richard in dallas at over in addison
you can go over there and buy an income tax package that will run on a personal computer
and do your income tax and it's one of those where you can change things you know to see what happens you know you say well let's see i've got some many so much of my charitable contributions on my itemized deductions
and then you discover that you had more then you thought you did you can go back in and change it
and it changes everything on the return and you don't have to go back and you know change every line with you know the eraser or the
the liquid paper or whatever
so it's really convenient to have that plus you know you've got it on the computer and it does all the calculations and the math and
you know makes for a lot of your errors on the return
yeah so
uh-huh
right but
uh-huh
yeah
yeah they start are starting real early on the computers when he gets to school he will probably be using a computer
you know yeah second or third grade probably and
he'll know more about computer then you will and you'll be having to go back to school just too keep up with him
yeah that's you have to have to learn have to learn a little bit as they go along you suddenly discover that your educated when the students are
well
well it's been a it's been interesting taking about computers it's that's one of my favorite subjects and i really i get into talking about them so
yeah so
yeah i don't remember i've checked off a bunch of stuff you know on there i don't remember what all was on there but i've talked about two or three things that i wasn't you know wasn't expecting to talk about so
yeah so it's been nice talking to you and guess maybe they'll ring us up again sometime
okay thanks bye-bye
oh my goodness oh where did they go
uh-huh
and he has made three applications to schools that give a double degree program because that's what he wanted to take
so he applied to the university of texas at austin and to the university of pennsylvania and to rice
so i think that it became very evident in the beginning of senior year
when he actually had to sit down with the applications he had about six schools that he was interested in
but he really decided that he wants to take engineering but he also wants to keep a liberal arts
yeah
uh-huh right well yeah and as i saw the fall progressing and
and his viewpoint it really became more evident that
you know a kind of a research dedicated a test tube scientist so
yeah
oh yes that's right yeah what kinds of fields did your children study in
uh-huh
oh wonderful uh-huh
is that right
uh-huh oh my
yeah
uh-huh
oh my
oh gee whiz isn't that wonderful uh-huh
is he local here in town or is uh-huh
oh good for him
uh-huh
oh
oh yes i've seen those they're remarkable because they come right off
oh
oh good for him
oh they've done well uh-huh oh yeah
that's right
that's right uh-huh
that's right you just use it when you need it and then it's you know gone and it sure is very effective and then you can move into the next necessary thing that is right
that's right
it's amazing isn't it amazing everything they do these days
everything and you know
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
this brings to mind is my chief complaint is then
the priority that's given to kids
that's what comes to mind anyway
well i don't know i guess i think one of the biggest changes that's taken place over the last twenty five years anyway is
both parents working and the
the mechanisms haven't really been in place to get to give kids all the attention they need
so i think that and i think we're sort of reaping the
results of that in
a lot of problems yeah i mean i don't blame people for both going to work both parents going to work
biggest social change in the middle class anyway that's that has
had a lot more repercussion that people every thought
um-hum
um-hum
tough isn't it
our
our situation is very much very similar
and we decided that when we had kids that we would have somebody home until they were well into school
it's difficult it's not so much
difficult financially i don't think as it is culturally
in that it's
kind of expected i think it's difficult on my wife not to be
professionally identified and that sort of thing
but i really feel like it's been worth it for the kids and when i look around i think i'm pretty glad we made the decision we did
and then all of the sudden the kids come along
yeah i think
you have to be
i don't want to make it melodramatic but you have to be kind of cultural really if you want to put your family first and
to sort of put a cap on things that you can really have and enjoy and just go ahead and
do what's right by your by your family
a lot of people
voting down school taxes and
well a degree of the eighties was i think maybe the most disappointing social phenomena that i witnessed
because i really did see living in dallas you see it you see it in magnified about twenty times
really
um-hum
stuff in the eighties
um-hum right
okay would you like to begin or would you like me to start
okay
yes
um-hum
right
right
more and more women out there in politics too as mayors or you know in helping to maybe get some legislation passed to have women have more rights i think still
but it's still
going from hm from homemakers into corporate leaders is still a big step
right
yes
i think it's true i think also people are having children at a older age so maybe like you know you go through college and then you maybe work for a few years and then you have your first child
and you know you know both sides of the coin
you know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly and to take care of
um-hum
right their role has to change to kind of accommodate us too i know i have three children and my oldest is eleven and i've pretty much been home since brian was born
and just recently i went back to work last school semester to tutor high school age students with learning disabilities and i was just out of the house two days a week
but i thought wow this is really only and it was only two days and i was home before three but getting the baby to day care getting the kids off to school i still did everything i always do
you know my husband still got up and went to work but
it only those two it made a big difference i thought wow a full time i don't think i could swing that
oh
oh boy
picked up
dinner
right
i bet i bet
have kids just starting kindergarten and they're forty years old and then like maybe a two year old at home and i think
boy i'm in my
so where do you stand on gun control
yeah
i'm more in favor of restricting them but as far as getting a number it's a little hard but
no cause people like to hunt and
and you know in some cases i think it's a good i mean it's a valid reason to have one for defense
although you know the statistics about
accidents
it's kind of
worrisome i mean i wouldn't
i know i don't like the idea of having guns around a lot because
they're mostly used i mean to they cause a lot of they there are a lot of accidents because of them being so handy
um-hum
i'm not sure
hm
no
hm
no
uh-huh
yeah it's kind of brutal
oh yeah
no i've actually done that with a friend of mine with his gun
and he
no the
the thing is if i have one handy though then
if i'm
or i can imagine somebody being outraged at something and saying i just i want to go for the gun i know where it is it's easy and then
pulling the trigger is so easy that
well
right
right uh-huh
right
so
in massachusetts
they have
well i figured i'm available now and actually i've had this thing on speaker phone and it's it tried about fifteen time
okay i
oh okay here we go
um-hum
do they have nautilus machines and that kind of thing
right is this something you do on your lunch hour
oh they allow you that free time to do that
oh i really wouldn't have thought they'd give you that much free time this is part of your day
right
hm i belong to a y and i substitute teach so i would love to get there monday wednesday friday or you know every other day but when the phone rings at six o'clock in the morning that's it
and it's kind of upsetting because if you go once a week it hurts every single time
you know i what i like about exercise i love the inaerobic exercise i like
stationary bike and those skiing machines that's work i'm not crazy about that
well i find i you know i read somewhere that twenty minutes on the bike is what you need every other day and i can do that and be pretty comfortable about it but i tried the nautilus machine yes it you do feel kind of goofy but even five minutes makes you feel tired you work harder on that thing
yeah like the if should the government make it universal or something like that
uh-huh you would be in favor of it
uh-huh
uh-huh
do they have options on who they
you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing
do you
uh-huh
uh-huh that's the way with me i don't know a whole lot about it i that's the only concern i would have because i think personalities
plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care
and if you didn't have any choice
on you know on who you go to
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
or to change even like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh that's one of my main concerns i have a friend that has
one two three four five doctors and then a team of doctors
and they finally determined what the problem was it took that long
and that something like that you know i thought if you couldn't change or
look elsewhere
you know for help
if you i don't know how that program works you know if you can do that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
i guess that's primarily was one of my thoughts you know because you know how government is
uh-huh
for them to have a choice on
if they're in favor of it or not
it would
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh i know where my son works they have an option
right now where they can have their own physician or they can choose one that their company
has elected
and that costs them less
if they take the doctor that the
that the company has selected
he get
well only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense
otherwise he you know he has to take the physician that and the hospital that the company has chosen as their
you know the one they have taken
and their again i mean he's gotten good service he took the less expensive one of course
uh-huh
right yeah
because that's the first i've really
known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option
you know to make the choice of what kind of insurance policy they what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take
we live in a rural area up here
are you familiar with any of the area at all
oh well that's a ways away but we live in clarion county
we have a cousin that lives in philadelphia
and
yes uh-huh
oh uh-huh that's a nice state
so i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in you know like more populated areas
as far as
the doctors that are available
course we have good physicians here too we've been pretty fortunate
we've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area
for some of the different fields
so we've been pretty fortunate um-hum
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
it sure is i still wish they could do more with the cancer situation though
they just don't seem to be i know they're making progress but not like
that i would like to see yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
but a lot of them don't do these things even and it doesn't seem to matter
so it real
uh-huh
as far as that goes so
i can't take any credit for not smoking either
so
it's hard to break it's a hard one to quit
yeah
yes very nice talking to you too and you have a good day
bye
all right miss kathy so what do you do you do it regularly and so forth
um-hum
well i have been so busy working i just retired about two weeks ago
which hasn't really been quite enough but i could very definitely tell the difference when i have two or three hours off and i run around on campus i'm retired from penn state university
and when i have an afternoon to walk around on campus i very definitely see a difference
and it i know that walking is good for you and i keep reading that it's much better for you than running because of the actions of the joints and so forth
but tell me about your exercise did you take your exercise because you had a problem or you just wanted to stay young and light or whatever
um-hum
how many how many hours a week do you estimate that you perform these things
an hour a day uh-huh
uh-huh
do you ever have time when you don't get this exercise in and notice that your weight goes up or anything like that
oh it's so you can tell the difference
uh-huh
i understand what you're saying well what about eating do you
do anything about the type of food you eat is that or do you just eat a normal balanced meal to go with that
um-hum
yeah that does keep you busy
well there're just two of us now my three children have all moved out
so diet wise i'm trying to keep us on a low
weight the low fat type of a diet my wife has high cholesterol
so i'm trying to keep that down and i do notice that when you go through
periods such as christmas and so forth where you eat out more often than normal if you don't get the exercise in your weight goes up
and for me exercise is one of the nicest ways of bringing -at weight down
no it's up until now its been mostly by myself because i would have been downtown and as i say walking around on campus picking up mail and doing things like that
and running downtown during my lunch period
well it gives me an opportunity to get some walking in and
yes
do you we have a bicycle in the house
the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be probably other than walking that's probably one of the better things you can do
have you ever tried one of those
uh-huh
with four children and sometimes there may be times you can't get out to go play you need to stay home that maybe one of these mechanical bicycles would be very helpful to you
well very good
considering it i'm going to get on that bicycle that we have and start doing some riding and i'm sure that's going to be the quickest way to get things under control
no i have one lives in amsterdam holland and one lives in
near warrington pennsylvania and the other one is in new jersey
so
well i have done research at penn state i've not a teacher i've done research in under water acoustics
it's been a noisy subject
well barbara whenever you get around to purchasing your next new car
what are going to be the chief considerations
i'm interested primarily in reliability
well
well let me give you a little history on that i drove gm cars for a long time
and in fact i had a chevrolet and it ended up it was only about five or six years old and i was paying on the average a hundred dollars a month in repair bills on that thing
and i just couldn't handle that so i took a deep breath and bought a toyota
and have lived happily ever after since then yes i've had two small problems neither one of which left me by the side of the road
with the toyota in the last five years and when i was buying that i was concerned primarily with reliability
and but i also wanted a hatchback
because you know you sometimes you have to carry bags of fertilizer
so
well it is a sports car that i got which is my first probably my last one because
high on the list when you get a sports car
no
just me
just me
does your car have an air bag
it does
yeah
yeah i suspect they probably will
and i think on my next car i'll be concerned i'll i think i will want antilock brakes
i've heard good things about them it was the first year it was offered on the toyota supra when i bought mine
and i was a little nervous about some new technology i mean i'd got to where i had this real hate relationship with anything that looked like service department at a dealership
um-hum
yeah
yeah i think i'd like that i don't know i have a friend who drives an acura legend which is very comfortable car
and it makes me more aware of how uncomfortable mine is every time i ride in his car
uh-huh
oh is it
uh-huh
yeah
yes
uh-huh
well that's great
that's great
so if you had to do it again you'd buy another chrysler do you think would you
that's
yeah that's interesting because i mean i was hearing a just on the way home from work the other day i heard something on the news about the trade deficit for december the figures were some very large number
i really have a problem buying japanese things and for years i bought american
and i don't know i hope by the time this car wears out and i hope that's not for another five or ten years
i hope that i can get an american one at that time
oh sure it
yeah
ever
hello
there
i'm surprised it's not telling us that
we're going but at any rate had do you have such a program where you work
well i'll tell you the truth when it when it was introduced to texas instruments it was a lot of hard feeling now my initial reaction was
benign i really didn't feel as a matter of fact i was sort of sympathetic in the sense that
you know we want to stamp out drug use
and the it's certainly no good for the company to have employees who are on drugs
and i don't really consider it an invasion of privacy in the because drug use is
a dangerous influence on other people in society
there i was in with a group of fuzzy heads however who
were rabidly opposed to it and i gradually became
proselytized by this group and the to me the big sensitive thing is well there there're couple things one is the is the insult of it
perhaps as a
preemployment test is one thing but to come in post facto and say to
employees who are tried and proven that they've been asked to do they're gonna have to submit to drug test is sort of a slap in the face
and of course there're problems with doing that you realize because
this requires a very strong minded management and a supervisory it requires the supervisor to be brass balled in a sense
as opposed to just randomly requiring it of everyone
um-hum
right
oh i see all right
right i guess the other objection that i was exposed to at texas instruments was the
unproductive nature of it that basically
drugs is not a problem at texas instruments and the corporation i think are going through this exercise mainly to remain in the good graces of their customer the government
rather than to improve their productivity by stamping out drug use because the likelihood of finding drug users in the ti population is very low
and so
people saw it as actually sort of a passing on of the testing requirement from the government
okay what kind of books do you like to read for enjoyment
uh-huh
what kind of business is it
uh-huh
uh-huh
really
uh-huh
well that's interesting
a what
oh really well that sounds interesting my mom always wants me to open a health food store but i'll i'm not really into it i don't know the i don't know that much about it so anyway but well that's interesting i personally i like mostly
if i had a book of my choice i like books i go to the library a lot and it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section i mean that to me is just ridiculous it's like life is to interesting to read fiction but
i always get books like i like to quilt well i'm not into quilting but i check a lot of books out to learn how i just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book but
i like to can and do food preservation and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff
and i like to check books out like that and i always come away with i'm a christian and i enjoy reading books about i have a real heart for people involved in cults
and you know christian books written by people about you know to help you out and stuff and
i read the bible i don't read the bible as much as i should but i think i would always think that no matter what i did so but i do enjoy reading that and so pretty much we have different interests i think in reading
uh-huh
thirty or younger
is that what you said
oh ten years younger oh that's funny
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
yeah maureen solomon i had a friend of mine has a book by her right now called foods that heal
they eat a lot of it you know you can take your vitamins and she was telling me to take zinc
uh-huh
no i haven't
uh-huh
the quantities and
what's the name of it again
life extension
um-hum
uh-huh oh really
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
really
um-hum
oh really
really
i know there's not any food that you can get
and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly you know and we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff but
i know that you know the further we go from adam the worse the food is for you but god still somehow makes us all
be able to still live i think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations well the last couple of processed foods you know i mean but
i don't know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess i'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do don't think we're going to restore the earth to you know i think jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be
but in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate and i think man isn't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but
i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just
i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like mother earth and we're going to restore the earth i just don't see that i think
i mean think to think that is almost it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what i'm saying it's to big than us and i think god's in charge and god's going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the
you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and
you know and try and do what's what i can do out of it that's practical but anyway so
uh-huh
uh-huh
because it's what
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
really
really you know i bet that's why we have some friends that eat only i just took this amish bread out of the oven man it's going to be good i had a starter that friend of mine made anyway i had a friend that read a book on that
the they drilled a well i don't know how many feet but it was three or four times deeper than it needed to be
well i personally don't have any problem with drug testing employees or potential employees do you
i mean basically
okay
i don't i really can't disagree with it
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think that's really the only fair way to do it
i really think it ought to be you know junkins all the way down
right as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first isn't that a fact
i've been retired from ti about a year but the program you know was still fairly new i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year
before i retired so i was not ever called upon to do a drug test i certainly wouldn't object to it and i think random is probably you know the only really fair way to do it
oh i absolutely
yeah
uh-huh
i don't think they'll have much choice do you
especially if they have anything do with you know government contracts or anything as matter of fact i want to believe that the
defense department more or less mandated that people you know who work on defense contracts you know do some sort of you know drug testing i think that's really what maybe prompted ti to do it i was in the
defense electronic division when i retired i know it was a you know it was a real hot item there i think i want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know d o d to do this sort of thing
yeah so you knew you know the atmosphere then
that's right
that's absolutely yeah i just can't disagree with you with you know the basic premise
it's to as far as i know it's you know seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as you know the testing goes
that's right
that's right
and offer you know help if you need help
yeah i do too
put you out on the street
yeah
that's right
no
that's right
oh absolutely not to mention alcohol
uh-huh
right uh-huh
oh yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yep right yeah i know a lot of people who
when it first or at least began was in the talking you know everybody knew it was coming it just a matter of time everybody was screaming you know invasion of privacy and all this stuff
but a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile and you know weighed the pros and cons decided you know it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs of course
that's right
that's right yep
that's right or yourself or
yeah
that's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that's true
uh-huh
yeah assembly people
that's right
absolutely
uh-huh oh absolutely yeah
uh-huh
yeah sure
sure
trickles up and down
sure does
yeah affects a lot of people
yeah
uh-huh
i think they probably will you know if they i'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer
i'm not sure every small company could do it
uh-huh
yeah it's got to help them too
uh-huh
yeah i do too that's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
no but it'll save in some areas yeah right
that's right
that certainly could happen that's a very competitive business
yeah i do too
i just really can't disagree with you
okay well it's nice to talk to you
and you take care
-kay bye-bye
prefer sports cars and responsive cars i like to drive kind of fast i guess but i'm finding that as i get older
i'm thinking that it would also be nice to have kind of a nicer bigger maybe more luxurious car to have in addition to the one i already have
it's a dodge daytona it's a shelby z they only made them for one year it's really just a variation on the other daytonas that they have out but i'm real happy with it
it's an eighty seven and it's the first turbo charge car i ever owned and i was a little reluctant about that because i heard things about
other people that owned turbo charge cars that the turbo would break quite often be very expensive to fix but i haven't had any problems with it
oh really
uh-huh how old is how old is the truck
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
oh
oh sure yeah we just recently bought a second car and we ended up getting a jeep wrangler
and it's funny though because it's this is actually my wife's car the jeep and
but it's fun having four wheel drive capability and a rugged suspension like that to go out and do things
but we're still finding that when we end up driving other people places that
it would be nice to have something where something roomier where people didn't have to duck their heads or scrunch their knees up and
something that would ride a little more smoothly especially when you travel
which we do a fair bit of traveling
oh yeah
yeah sure
it's
i don't know when you're when you're used to one thing i guess something different always seems like it would be fun to have or nice to have
but
yeah we haven't had it for very long we got it in september right around labor day i guess it was and so it doesn't have a whole lot of miles on it yet
but up here in rochester new york it's nice to have a four wheel drive capability especially on days like today where we have about six inches of snow coming down out there
yeah i was a little surprised to find i i'm not the sort of person that's going to go out and shop for exclusively for an american built car but i am the sort of person that feels good knowing that the car they like the best is american
made and american built but i was reading in the paper the other day that
surprisingly enough a lot of cars that you think are american aren't always and in fact they listed the jeep wrangler as being almost exclusively made in either mexico or canada
which isn't that far away but i it surprised me i always thought jeep was about as american as you could get as far as manufacturing goes at least
really
yeah
no yeah
yeah i guess you never know in fact they had a whole system decoding the vehicle identification number
so you could figure out even right down to where the factory was which state the factory was in where it built
yeah
but
it was interesting
oh really
oh really what sorts of problems did you have with it
are you satisfied with the public school system in your area
okay
sure uh-huh
yeah i don't agree with that either the robin hood approach where the rich give to the poor
no i don't people move to the suburbs to richardson and plano mostly because of the school district because of the level of education that's offered
yeah well it costs so much in taxes here and even if they do give money to the poorer school districts i don't think it's going to lower my taxes at all
yeah
sure
well that's exactly what their doing
i don't think that's going to improve the talent as far as the school teaching goes
yeah
well i think it is too
no i went to school in wisconsin
right
uh-huh well we need qualified teachers no matter whether they're teaching in the inner city or the suburbs
the trouble is that the suburbs are able to pay more that's going to attract the better teachers
well it could very well be there is a definite racial split here
well i was in a rural area in wisconsin and we had a good public school system but i don't think it was great i think the curriculum was very deficient to prepare people to go to college
but the racial mix of students in my area was entirely white we had no minorities at all
huh
right
sure
well the good school districts here do have honors programs they do encourage that among the students who are prepared to go to college but that brings up a whole bunch of other problems
sure
all right i haven't heard that yet
that's interesting i know some people at work who have children in high school and they're not satisfied with the school district at all and they do send their kids to the private schools
they send them to saint marks i think where ever that's located
yeah uh-huh
well he said about six hundred a month and that doesn't include their personal expense
so you're talking about college level fees here
sure but i think i think the honors programs are good in the high schools but some of the problems you get are the kids that are in those programs get harassed by their peers
for doing too well
and that discourages them from doing well
yeah
uh-huh
well their allowed to progress at their own pace then
all right
no
i can relate to part of that in my high school say just for example in my math courses i was not to brag about this at all i was so far ahead of everybody else that i didn't have to go to class
and i got to sit by myself in an empty room while everybody else was in class taking algebra work at my own pace
sure
yeah
yeah i'm sure that has a definite effect
yeah
well i know people i don't have any kids either but i know people who had been neighbors once upon a time
who had kids and whenever the father was traveling away on business or they had financial problems their kids their it was definitely noticed at their performance in school
yeah it got so bad with this one kid that the school called their parents up to ask if there were any problems going on
because his performance at school had degraded so much
i believe in that
yeah
right well i remember as a kid they had pta parent teacher association meetings all the time
i don't know
sure
uh-huh
yeah well the dropout rate is so high in dallas and fort worth yes it is i think it's thirty eight
how did you get on this list
oh okay
all righty well now what would you say about these everyday
invasions of our privacy what ideas do you have on that doug
in what in what manner
um-hum
well the thing that i thought they were concerned about was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something
and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other
organizations and i thought that was beginning to invade the privacy of people because
the things about where you live and maybe what you purchased in
past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this
additional knowledge to me that's an invasion of privacy
uh-huh
do you consider these serious problems
um-hum well what should we do about it or what could be done about it do you think to correct it
and not be allowed to be to given out by those companies
i mean it should be made a national or a state law to protect people so that you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies
in other words if you call the company yourself directly and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else you know from the outside so to speak then you'd
you'd feel more free to go into detail with them
but we have no control of that now and then you you're when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you feel that it someday might be used against you
the last auto repair i had was i have a nineteen eighty four nissan truck
i had a tune up done and i had the i had the brakes done on it
and the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope
and it has eight spark plugs
and it's hard to get at them and plus
as far as maintenance tasks that i do myself
i usually change the oil and wash the air filter and i had an occasion to change the had to change the battery once
but
i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the oil needs should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings and the lubrication system needs to be lubricated and
and they wanted something like fifteen dollars up front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they i had them another thing i let them do sometimes is that
i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics that's free okay and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see
and they told me that my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know
but still it was cheaper in the long run and so i just got the brakes done and i thought that was a good deal and plus
and they we repacked the wheel bearings yeah but
i've had considerable experience i you might say i'm a
a good back yard mechanic and i you know i took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but i still have a pretty good feel for it
but one thing i didn't know is that
when i was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars i had bigger cars
and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those but what i was surprised at is that on my little nissan
i bought the truck with about sixty thousand i have almost a hundred and ten
so i drove on those brake pads
for you know forty five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them so those small little trucks and cars like that they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good
exactly so i you know but i just did it anyway i like to i like to stay up on it you know like to kind of stay up on it then
if you go in like just about any point any you know point in time
and pull my dip stick
and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say a light golden brown you know it's not dirty i keep it that way because that's
that is the key to the longevity so
so how
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
okay
um-hum
you're talking about the vibration dampener
that's the vibration dampener yeah
okay
hm
oh
hm
oh
hm
um-hum
all right amy how are you doing today
oh all righty i think we know what we're going to speak about tell you what i'll start off how's that
i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back
hangings on weekends
in public places there is one state that does that by the way
i want to say oklahoma i saw something the other night about it
but i think if we quit building these taj mahals with the color tvs
and sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and let's just quit screwing up the system
that's pathetic
that's pathetic
this is true and the way the law reads if they sentence you to
life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit bsing with the system
exactly
a life for a life
the old charles manson case i mean the guy is really
when there's my understanding when there's a verdict and it for example there's a hung jury here in fort worth two day in eight to four and bam the guy got off
he was he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay
kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight
there's a certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people seventy percent of the people said hey
the guy's guilty
exactly
exactly because it's not next day they have the start the trial is x number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more
i think that if it's an if it's not a split decision go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program
but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision what are your feelings
hm
yeah i get back to price's comment when he was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know
exactly
yeah i mean you're in dallas so everybody i can't believe they can like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense
you'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer
this is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation
oh so you're at the house you're not at the plant
oh hold it
oh that's good that's good i thought i heard a holler there in the background but i wasn't sure
oh goodness well i'll let you get i enjoyed it bye
what kind of books do you enjoy
uh-huh
uh-huh sounds like we like the same kind
well see i read the oh helen mcimes i read a trilogy of hers
yeah
a group of three in one book
she's the one that writes
they're real good she's been writing for a long time and i was trying to remember she wrote she writes they've always have gone the spy
thing with them you know setting in foreign places or and they're they always have kind of a twist to them
oh yeah um-hum
yeah those are good too
uh-huh
and then i got
some of robert ludlum's i like those too do you like him
yeah i get the bourne supreme the bourne ones i get them all mixed up
yeah i have a lot of those in hardback too
and did you read fried green tomatoes
oh it's wonderful
well my daughter gave it to me quite a while ago to read
and then i guess what brought it to mind was that last time i went to see the movie
and it did not disappoint me and it's just so well written of course fanny flag wrote it
and it's got humor in it and a little bit of suspense
and you'll cry
well i think i didn't read steel magnolias but i think it's probably better than steel magnolias were
the movie is anyway and steel magnolias was tremendous
but this one it just sort of has a well my husband enjoyed it i just kind of you know mixed feelings i didn't know whether he it might be a woman's movie
but he just he just raved about the actresses in it that they were so good and everything was real and
it was just really good and the reason my daughter gave it to me is because my mother is in a nursing home
and i think that she was trying to give me something to kind of make me get a message of some kind
um-hum
um-hum well i would highly recommended it and don't get discouraged in the first few chapters
well you may have to i do to and i had to go back and reread
because you have to get the they're telling two stories at once
and you have to get it straight and get the names straight
that's the thing get all the names straight
uh-huh where you you're working with two stories and once you get that down it flows and you can't wait to get to the next part
it it's one of those that you get caught up in
oh
i haven't read that book was it good
okay i'll have to see if i can get it
oh all right wonderful
no you can't i'd love to borrow it from you
all right
we're all supposed to say what do we read for improvement what have you read for improvement
um-hum
i do too
well if you're like me there're so many technical things to read
that when i read at home
yeah i just don't want to
to well of course i garden a lot and i read a lot of gardening things
but
oh yes neil and then the american gardening society puts out a real good book on vegetables
um-hum you don't need vegetables
yeah
um-hum
yeah it's a good place for them if the dogs
actually i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car i've got a couple older cars they're both over ten years old
and they've served me well
but i kind of would like to get a more gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer
and so i need to make sure i've got one that i can fit
all five of us into and if you if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time
well i've kind of been leaning towards a caravan
now i know that they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years
but i like the dodge products
and been couple times i've had a opportunity to rent one
i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size
and i think that would that would serve us well plus it's got good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store
um-hum exactly correct
yeah if you want
yes
yeah it the dodge caravans will do that
you can take the usually there's a double seat behind the front buckets
and then if you get the and then there's a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out
and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front or you can take the three seat out and just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back
so it's very versatile you can move the seats all around that's the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat and move it forward
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i think that's getting to be kind of important now that you know the price is becoming
the driving factor and then you look at once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at what you can buy with it where before i think you
you looked at the car you wanted and then you looked to see how well you could afford it
or how you could afford it
yeah
yeah i know they're trying to do everything they can to end the recession
i got a nine and a half percent interest rate
not sure i could do much better today
but that is also effecting buying a new car
well that and
two fourteen year olds will be fifteen on the fourth of july
so
yeah they're twins born on the bicentennial
you're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto july fourth seventy six
so i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be
behind the wheel of a car so america's safe for another fifteen month
and after that
now i may keep the one or both of the two cars i currently have for them to drive you know they're
they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that i feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive
you know what i mean it i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the honda
they're just
uh-huh
is that right
uh-huh
right
jeez
well
yes definitely
the thing is that they're i think it's a two part seat belt though there's the door belt and then there's one a lap belt
yeah
yeah
yeah the supports
a good source of information i've found has always been these used car manuals
because you can flip through the used car manuals and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past
and you can look at the track record on a car over the year and you usually notice a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where there's fewer problems and you get an idea on how well
the next car's going to be now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the pontiac grand prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car as long as they aren't
uh-huh
yeah sure
uh-huh
yeah i remember when that happened so unless they're really changing the model
yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the fewer mistakes than it had the year before
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i agree
uh-huh
right now i'm just i don't really have a budget per se i'm i
you know which means at the moment paying off the visa bill and keeping everything else under control
but no i don't really have a budget at the moment
that then it goes through the moon so
yeah so
what'd you
so you can afford to get a house
yeah
so what do you and your husband do
are you really
hm
no kidding
i see so overseas where would you be going
really
really how long would you be there
with what church
oh yes i know who they are they have an office in costa mesa as i recall
um-hum
true enough so what languages do you speak besides english of course
um-hum
in france
must have been terrible
the
was it henry macon said that the
the language is like a is like a man slowly bleeding to death slowly hemorrhaging to death without new infusions that will eventually die
and i it just amazes me that the french don't recognize that free style english is just
takes on
are you big into lawn and garden work
well do you is it a new house or
um-hum
okay i think one of the
some of the problems with oak trees is their leaves tend to accumulate and they leach a lot of acid into the soil
so i found that when i had a wooded lot that i needed to put a lot of lime out
to neutralize the acid from the oak leaves
but there's still a problem that the shade from the trees just grass cannot grow
and one of the things that we did just we sort of made a little garden that surrounded the trees and planted pachysandra
which is a shade plant that seems to do well underneath the trees
yeah so that saved the bare spots and you know also eliminated mowing the that area of the lawn
um-hum
um-hum
i don't think there's it's an impossible task
um-hum
yeah
well one of the things you may need come fall is a leaf blower or a leaf vacuum
because i've you know my wooded lot at my previous house i didn't have to mow the lawn very often because it didn't grow that fast
but in the fall i had to spend a couple of weekends out there on you know two separate weekends just getting rid of leaves
well i had a leaf vacuum to pick them up and
in the front yard i would just drive up to the curb and drop them at the curb the county had a pickup service for leaves dropped at the curb
and for the back i would vacuum them up and then put them on a tarp and drag the tarp out front to dump them
and springtime you have to use bags to pack them
yeah well craftsman put out a leaf vacuum a few years back craftsman sears and roebuck
and i think it was about two hundred dollars or something like that it was a very powerful machine
and it would have a tendency to pick up some of the acorns if they didn't get pressed into the ground
um-hum
yeah
right
yeah it's especially delightful moving from an apartment to a house so that you can have a little piece of turf you can call your own
um-hum
um-hum
well you better price the new shrubs before you do that
um-hum
yeah
well my wife got carried away this past year and she cleared out a lot of the existing gardens and replanted with new things
and i think she spent over a thousand dollars on plants and fertilizers and mulch and everything else and it's not hard to go through the money doing that
um-hum
we don't have that here we've got some local nurseries that are pretty fair on price but still in the metropolitan area they hold a gun to your head while they while you write out your check
all right good luck with your new home
and nice talking to you
bye
well i guess i'll go ahead and start off i'm from kansas originally and in growing up you know basically
we all learned how to properly handle guns and have the proper amount of respect for them you know we did the hunter safety training and that kind of thing and
so you know i guess i really am not in favor of a lot of restrictions on handguns just because at least the environment i grew up in we're all taught in an early age to respect them and handle them properly
unfortunately most i guess most people aren't and so that presents kind of a problem
funny you know some restrictions may be necessary but
you know a total ban or something like that i think is kind of
yeah
um-hum
sure
oh yeah
exactly
in actually you know i have never hunted which is the ironic thing i've done a lot of target shooting
you know to get some skills but i've never actually hunted
um-hum yeah
yeah
right
yeah
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
exactly i mean a gun lock is cheap insurance
you know
so i don't see any reason why a parent shouldn't do that
um-hum oh definitely i would
um-hum
right yeah
um-hum
yeah he
yeah exactly you know i mean the guy seems like a nice alternative but the problem is i mean at least for me he's economically conservative which is good but socially he seems to be pretty liberal
which is not my bent
right
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right
yeah the slippery slope argument
do you have any
i have i have one it's and it's a real pet peeve of mine it seems i do work during the day and when i'm home you know i'm either cooking or running doing things or laundry or stuff and i hate when the phone rings
and it turns out to be a telephone salesman
and it's real there're two pet peeves about it number one i really feel that that's my private you know my own home
and i and if i want something i will get it i will go out and get it myself and i will never i never buy anything from a telephone
so i really feel that it is a real invasion they're invading my time and my space by you know interfering in whatever i'm doing for and i it really bothers me
it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't you know ignore it quite as easily and i try to be polite but at the same point
well i just say thank you very much for calling but i'm not interested and then i hang up before they can say anything
and
i have i sort of have a thought like you can
prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists
i wish that there were a way that you could get your you know submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty
for anyone who calls you to sell things from a business
you do that by the postal service has some information which you fill out and they it's for every company i mean you can't do it for any
you know but you can then send it and they can they tell that company's not allowed to sent it you any junk mail if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can
yeah you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to
not to get you know junk mail from specific companies
and i wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company and you could say that have your number put in a registry and then anyone making these calls has to check that registry for that area
and could not should and is not allowed under penalty of you know being reported or something to call you
um-hum
oh i'm guilty of that sometimes because i've called and there really wasn't any significant message and i and i wasn't going to be available to be called back
when you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number
well legally now they're not allowed they're you do not have to give a telephone number
yes and i don't really like announcing in public
you know when you're sitting there my and i don't like the way telephone numbers can be used we once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number but it turned out it had to been my husband's office phone number
and we were able we weren't actually able to trace it but we were able to discard the charges but it was
um-hum
um-hum
yeah same with my husband it was a charge card and social security number
well you should never give the social security number
if sometimes if you charge sometimes i charge theater tickets
over the phone and then you know because they pick them up at the box office will call
but that's the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone and that was because i initiated it
and occasionally i do order things from catalogs
over the phone but again it's i initiate it not the company
the other thing is though you do not have to if you're buying something in a store and they and you pay for it by charge
and they ask you for your telephone number you do not have to give it that is one that's a law that went into effect i don't know a year or two ago
and you can just say i'm sorry that i'm not required to give that by law and then they won't a lot of stores will still ask
but the credit card company you know accepts the charges i mean it's a the credit cards company -'s responsibility
so what and this
well this it would this is limited to the privacy issue the invasion of privacy
yeah and i guess that was my that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy for people outside the family of course i've got little pet peeves you know with my family
you know but of course i guess that just comes with the with the territory with a family that does a mother you lose some privacy
but
um-hum nothing that you felt that you know any experiences you've had at work
so many things i think over the years have been accepted i mean when you that are no longer done
i mean i can remember when i was very young much younger and i applied for a job they said well aren't you planning to have children well i mean that's none of their business
and but of course now by law they can't ask that
so i mean there has been i think a lot to done to protect privacy
how do you feel
um-hum
yeah
that's right do you feel that drug testing is an invasion of privacy
or aids testing
yeah um-hum
yeah
i feel that way too i sometimes feel you know sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit
uh-huh
yeah
that's right yeah i know i yeah i feel you know i think some of the people that oppose you know mandatory drug testing for certain areas say well it's not
i'm sorry what
i don't no i haven't recently
no i'm not no
what's that
are you married
oh really
wow so do you like football
do you live in dallas
yeah
i haven't hum-um
but
yeah
yeah right now i'm in college so i'm more into college football than professional i think
yeah so
nursing
oh really
cool
i don't know i've thought a lot about labor and delivery but i don't know
oh really wow
is she a nurse in dallas
oh
uh-huh
hm
wow
um-hum
well that's great
yeah
are you in san antonio
oh okay
hm
right
profession i mean he's at medical school in san antonio right now
so
yeah
thanks
all right bye-bye
current events you take a newspaper
is that right is that how you usually keep up on the news
uh-huh
yeah
yeah some
oh
huh
uh-huh
right
i haven't seen it
yeah i don't think we got the full story but i don't you know i haven't seen the movie so i don't really have an opinion about what he had to say yet
right
that's probably exactly right
right
that's right
that's right so what brought you to san francisco have
did are you living right in san francisco then
oh well you're right in the middle of things then aren't you
a job
my brother lived out here and he and my dad owned a little trucking company and they asked my husband to come and run it
but we lived in concord for several years before that
and he grew up over there in san mateo so we know that
right
so we
about nine years now
i do i really like it
yeah i really like it
oh well i'm kind of off and on
right now i'm kind of off
okay what type of exercise do you do
okay i guess you don't enjoy that very much
you find that to be boring
yeah
well i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring
but i
yeah i haven't decided whether you're whether i wanna play yet or not i just bought myself a solo flex machine i don't know if you've seen those advertised on tv
it's one of those universal type machines exercise machine but i haven't really sat down and used it much yet so it's collecting dust right now
i used to jog somewhat
uh-huh well that's good yeah my parents have a treadmill it's when i go visit them i'll get on that thing every now and then
um-hum no i just got the bicycle out today and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something
i been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold so i thought i'd better get outside and do something and not waste the day
but yeah i need to start jogging again i've always found that to be really one of the best forms of exercise but it's terribly boring and so i really don't ever keep a program up consistently
no i never have well i don't jog enough i think to develop any injuries i usually only go about a mile or two
yeah it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt supposed to be much better if you find grass or dirt to jog on
have to have the right type of shoes too that's very important
but
uh-huh
ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do but like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining a program
so i'll bicycle i get into that for a little while and maybe go out and on a consistent basis every couple a days and ride a bike for awhile but then i'll get tired of doing that maybe start jogging again and go out three or four nights a week
but that gets old too in a very short order i'm hoping that this solo flex will
change things a little bit i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
yeah
so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can start some type of regular program
i've always found that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep something going
when i was in high school we had a choice of taking physical education courses on exercise and one of those involved a six week session on a universal machine
and that was very helpful and we kept charts of our progress and consistently increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks
i found that to be very helpful
sounds like something i should do
uh-huh
how often do you go out each week on your walking
okay how far about how far do you go walking
okay
yeah that's good well they say that walking is just as good if not better than jogging
it
sure well if you keep up a consistent pace just to keep the heart rate going
yeah
yeah
but it's a lot less stressful on the joints than jogging is
okay which shows do you watch on tv
okay
right i every now and then i'll watch espn i get cable on tv and they have a couple of shows called basic training and what is the other one called
uh-huh
bodies in motion that's the name of the one i was thinking of
with gil janklowicz
they're always in hawaii someplace on the on the beach
yeah well they do low impact stuff now they're on everyday
yeah every morning
it's on espn at what time i can't remember what time
it's
-ell i can't remember offhand what time
they have that show on
yeah every now and then
they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock everyday
monday through friday
case you're interested in that
so i'm kind of bad about that myself
so all right good night bye
okay have you ever served as a juror
uh-huh
i never have either
well i think it's a good idea i think our justice system needs a major overhaul and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it but i think they've got a lot of problems
true
yeah i think that's true
yeah do you would you prefer all trials by a judge
yeah i would agree with that i think you're right i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company and
uh-huh
if they give them all the information i don't know when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff
sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave and
the judge decides whether or not they should hear it
right
yeah
do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
some of them disagree i mean some of them said one way and some the other
i think it does have to be unanimous
i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but
i thought that they all had to agree or else they it was a hung jury
and
yeah i don't know how i feel about that i think maybe
majority might be sufficient
it's hard to say though i
oh
yeah i hadn't thought about international trials at all
right
yeah
yeah
yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average joe off the street
for something like that because of the cultural differences
things like that
yeah what about uniform sentencing
right yeah like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years it's not a discretionary thing
yeah
i wish that when they sentence someone if they're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years
you know
yeah i
yeah and sometimes those people are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble
yeah i don't believe that very often happens
i don't think so either in fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad
yeah
i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them do something that's not pleasant
and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them and
yeah
yeah something besides license plates and tiddlywinks
yeah
yeah
well i think that covers it
it was nice talking to you
bye
okay my hobby is sewing i i've just started learning how to sew
and i've taken some classes and i've made a few garments do you sew at all
did you
oh
yeah
uh-huh clothes are getting so expensive now in the stores and the quality is sometimes so poor that it really is worth while to sew
right an
yeah
it certainly is and the patterns have gone up tremendously too the prices for them
you used to could get you know a pattern for two or three dollars now they're like you know five six seven eight
oh no i'm not
huh-uh no the cheapest ones now are like maybe four or five dollars
six seven and then you get into the vogues they get up into twelve and fifteen and on like that
right now i'm just sewing for myself i do have two daughters that you know out they're grown now though i wish that i had started sewing you know when they were younger
oh i guess i just
you know i always i have always tried to sew and i didn't like the way it looked so i'd never wear anything but now i have bought some new sewing equipment i bought the serger machine
and it really makes it look professional and i've taken some classes here in dallas
yeah
right
i know a lot of people where i work make their clothes it's just there's just so many people sewing now days
uh-huh
huh-uh no i'm not that talented
right
i have a sister that can crochet real well or knit i guess i mean knit and she knits things like hats and sweaters an you know
bed throws
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh my goodness
yeah now they have the knitting machines that will do it for you
uh-huh
yeah
are you familiar with what a serger is the serger sewing machine
well you know in when we used to sew we'd sew the seam and then we'd finish the edges and we would trim the seams and finish the edges
well this machine does it all in one step it's
right and it's cutting off the there are two knives and it cuts off the you know excess seam allowance
and it really makes it look professional
especially on you know i mean from the inside you know how you look under something that you've made and it doesn't really
but the serger really makes it look professional
they're pretty expensive i like i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine
uh-huh
right
ah
yeah
no i play the piano
oh you do
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh well i'm not that great either i used to be a lot better than i am now i have played for the church choir and
i played for the choral club in high school and
but i you know i don't practice a lot anymore and you know you get rusty
uh-huh
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah right
uh-huh
well sewing does take up take an awful lot of time takes an awful lot of time
yeah
yeah
yeah
on the on the right on the straight grain and all that stuff uh-huh
yeah that that's the part that i don't like too
yeah i like sewing up the garment itself i really like to do that but the cutting and the
all the even the cutting i don't like
well that's about it really it's it has four threads instead of the regular basic two threads
and it's
no you can either use three or four of the threads
it's kind of it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine like the they're loopers under the bottom
and then the there's a seam stitch and it's the loopers that form the edge you know that edge finish
and that's what really makes it look professional you can do a lot with the serger though you can make piping and cording and
you can use all kinds of different
textures of thread
and
yes but you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine you can't throw your sewing machine away you need it to do things like button holes and
seams that need to be really strong need to be done on the sewing machine
it's
no it's a it's a it's a machine it's not exactly a sewing machine but it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff but there are other things that
a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do like you can't top stitch with it
you know you can't do top stitching or
there's a few things that you just can't do with it will also do a rolled edge
gee it's just so versatile like i
yeah
yeah it's -t's hard to get it's hard to maintain a real level of
i don't know what you'd call it i guess motivation at least for me it is i mean
yeah i actually i lift weights pretty regular now and i've done it for the last oh i don't know ten twelve years
so it works pretty well for me but still it's like you say the motivation is not always there especially in the cold weather
and i'm not real used to the cold up here anyway just because i'm from florida really
yeah a bit a bit so but i don't know it's good to get it you get that good feeling you know when you get done and you're glad you did it i guess but
right
sure
uh-huh
that makes it rough because then
sure
yeah that's
yeah
oh yeah that's pretty weird but yeah i don't know i do a lot of stuff or i at least i have in the past done a lot of weird a lot of different activities
and moving down here is in a way kind of or moving up here is pretty bad because i can't do as much as i used to because the weather just doesn't permit it you know so
exactly and it is you know i mean
right
um-hum
sure
oh yeah
kind of like a soloflex or something
um-hum
oh that's good
yeah
right
oh
right
uh-huh
sure
right uh-huh
right yeah it it'd be too much of a hassle
yeah
oh you do
uh-huh
yeah it when i'm living in florida i'm an intern up here at honeywell and when i live in florida it's a lot easy you know it's it everything's nice out and my parents live down there now
i think the first thing they said i've written this down so it would is it do you think it's possible to have honesty in government
or an honest government
yeah
right that's a good point
that's an yeah that's interesting i had read something one time and it was just applying to governments in general it was written many years ago
it said that is impossible to have
a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers
and i thought that was interesting
it wasn't just talking about our government it was just government in general from times past you know on and
right and that would be a next question to ask how many do you think are in there for but because they wanna be of service to us
or are they in there for their own gains and personally i feel it's probably there's probably some of each
um-hum yeah
yeah
oh yeah
and they talked the other let's see third question was how much self-serving for their own gains do you think goes on then they that's hard to i'm sure there's a lot but i agree with you there's a lot in business i think that's just
i think that's very normal
that we should not i mean i think we put too much on politicians we expect them
to only be there to serve us you know
yeah
that's a problem isn't it
it's interesting because i'm taking a texas government class right now and
one of the things i always it's so easy to blame them to a lot of times i think it's our own fault
they lie to us because we don't wanna hear the truth and if
if they tell us the truth we don't elect them and
especially with all this front stuff coming up here lately
about people's past and i don't know why anybody would wanna get under that scrutiny anymore
because it's i think it's gotten just well we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life and
and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at
right
you know i also think it'd be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and threw them out i don't think there would be too many left you know
um-hum
at it's tcjc tarrant county junior college yeah and it's really it's really enjoyable i like it
and they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption and i don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally
yeah but that doesn't mean i don't think making laws will
stop it
no sure didn't did it
so no i think you can legislate but i think there's no way that you'd eliminated all by legislating and we'd end up with so many more laws that
you know i mean i just think that's human nature that you're gonna have corruption
in government in business personal life i mean you know
right
yeah
yeah i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes but when i think about where i'd wanna go
you know this is still the best or i can
yeah at it's worst i think we've got the best
something that i guess some people abuse a lot they tend to get let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out there on them we didn't get too much built up on it that we didn't know it was out there but
we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable
line of credit at our credit union and used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off
right
yeah it's strange that i guess to draw new customers i've seen a few banks in this area have oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine
i can't imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because
that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent
right
the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the discover only it was a gold visa that offered one percent of all your purchases back
but they had a user's fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee
if you use it at a
a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so that would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union
that we're with does charge you if you happen to use outside their's but that's there's so many of theirs that it doesn't matter i hardly i never have that i know of
um-hum
yep
the way the metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so there's several opportunities to use the
card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash fact it's the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that i'm with so that's nice to have those around
and i only drive ten miles to work so it's kind of a one of those situations where they're all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them
i have done that once and i did it gosh i forget why i guess i
i don't know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasn't too bad it wasn't but one percent or so it was one of the mastercards i had
hum
yeah
i guess that's the way they
planned on doing it i can't imagine what i it's been several years i can't imagine what i did to
i do seem to recall
oh i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a
gosh i don't know what it i don't think it was a thousand now that i think about it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other places were closed it was after hours as it were and
there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open
right the car that probably the kind we'll get next and
i
i do a lot of driving commute i have about
fifty three miles one way to commute here in utah but it's freeway and it's not bad but the cars i've been getting i've got a toyota
it's economical now i've got a honda now and it's a five speed
and for the all the driving i do that is the kind i
i think i'd probably look at next i'm not sure
uh-huh
i see
our family's gone we had six children at one time but they've they're all gone and so we can go to the smaller car now but we did have to back then it was station wagons
as for a family when you start taking much with you or going any place you really need a little more room
i have a son in plano texas who has four boys and he got a
a van and he really enjoys it
is it
oh okay well he i know i've had several from richardson
he works for jc penney's
uh-huh yes uh-huh
yeah he
um-hum well good yeah he he's been down there going on three years now i guess uh-huh
yes uh-huh they closed at pittsburgh i think and they're moving but it's
so in fact i was just down there thursday i was in el paso and then i had a couple hours at dallas airport
airport and they come out and got to visit with them for a while i got i got a new little brand grandbaby and first time i've seen him
but
seems like they get a lot better mileage i had a hundred and eighty thousand on the toyota that i had in eighty and that thing i hadn't had any problems at all it was just going strong when i sold it
but i guess it's just it depends there's lemons in all of them i guess but
i do too yeah
um-hum
right yeah
oh wow i've been yeah i've been working
well i that's it i've been working for
oh thirty five years for the government and think i've got a pretty good job but i don't make that much
and i've got
a degree and everything else you see and i and i don't know hopefully you you'd think that if they were making that kind of money they would try to have a little pride in
in the product that they put out so it is a good car but
my family's bought my sister bought a buick paid twenty thousand dollars for it she's had nothing but trouble with that thing
and you know you pay that kind of money you should it should be trouble free at least for fifty seventy thousand and then
and she's had it in the in the garage and shop and she called today and said oh it's leaking oil out of the head gasket she's only got about twenty thousand on it
so she's got to take that back in and have them work on it but and i and i think it from what i can hear it's just because they
they don't take the pride that the japanese do or something in their work or workmanship that when something comes out and their name's on it they want it to be the best and so i hate to stay away from
correct i assume this is involuntary drug testing from employers
right
well i tend to look at it like right i mean without you know a suspicion of you know reasonable suspicion of something going on i would have to probably tend to
agree that at least in most cases it should not be done i also my big question of course is you know this is a pretty steep thing for something the last i heard was not a hundred percent effective
or you know accurate with it not being a hundred percent accurate that leaves open you know quite a bit of room for you know false positive
absolutely you know that
sure because i mean it's like someone goes on trial for something
the press lets everybody know so no matter how many times you're acquitted
but so there is that i mean but also you know as someone who does not use any controlled substances i
you know part of me says well as long as it's accurate i don't care if they test and if someone is using it they should be you know caught for it as long as it's illegal
so you know that is a tough things to juggle between the two
and that does bring up a good point in that if it's not having an impact then what right does the employer have to
you know to get information about that
do you have any strong feelings about gun control
i agree there should be some control but how strong of a control do you think there ought to be
okay
sure
but if you make owning a gun a crime only criminals will have guns i've heard that before and that's probably true
sure
yeah i agree with that i think that some states are just far too lenient texas and florida are very easy on gun ownership being able to buy guns all it takes is a driver's license
and sign an affidavit saying that you didn't commit any felonies
so i think that ought to be tightened up i favor holding the guns say for seven days or whatever until you can check out whether somebody is legitimate or not
and i think that might stop some of the impulsive crimes but things that like that are planned selling guns to new york city things of that nature i don't think you're ever going to be able to stop that
there's just too much of a demand and people are going to get ahold of guns no matter what the restrictions are
yeah
and a lot of people own guns just as a hobby and hunters in particular they're not buying guns to commit any crimes at all just pursuing their hobby
the semi automatic weapons assault rifles things like that really have no place for a sportsman
uh-huh
yeah i don't see any problem with owning a gun for self protection but education is a big part of that people need to be educated on how to how to how to store their weapons so the kids can't get at them and so they're not a threat to the rest of the family
a lot of people don't get that type of education they don't have any type of safeguards on their weapons at home
yeah
yeah gun control legislation is really tough to beat i mean the nra is so strong and they lobby a lot in congress
so it's going to be really tough to add gun control type of laws to what we already have
sure
yeah i'll have to agree with that it i never really correlated those two incidences say crime at home versus an international war
but
yeah i guess i don't know how to how to place that
yeah that's true and when it gets to the point where it's unacceptable where the majority of the people find it unacceptable they may find cause to write their congressman and lobby for some stronger controls
but yeah we are very a very tolerant society and it takes a great deal of abuse before we get our act together
right
uh-huh
yeah
i think it depends on who's leading the crusade and how strong they feel about it take for instance mothers against drunk driving that used to be just a very small organization started by a housewife
and it i think it's made an impact i mean it it's made a lot of people cut down on their drinking and driving because the laws are enforced stronger now
dwi convictions are very serious
right
because they're liable anybody who serves anything to anybody is liable can be sued
with guns i think it ought to be the same way
i think people who own guns ought to be held responsible for things that happen with those weapons
well i saw a talk show just the other night where there was a mother on the show and her son had been killed in a neighbor's house by one of the neighbor's handguns
when only the other kids were at home they apparently had three handguns that were in plain sight one on top of the refrigerator one in the on the bedroom dresser and one somewhere else but
just teenagers and grade school kids at home and one of the kids got shot by a gun got killed
but somebody's got to be
somebody's got to be held responsible
ultimately
so i don't know i think the law should be tightened up on gun ownership but i can't see a total ban on it at all
because then you're still going to have criminals with guns and it's not going to help the situation there people want to break the law they're going to do it
well they have a lot tighter controls on importing things of that nature too you can't get them through airports
you know and i don't know what the penalties are for trying to smuggle guns into a country like that but i imagine they're quite severe
right
well i've heard it said that that's one of the reasons why we're not as much a threat to be attacked by other countries because everybody and his brother's got a gun at home
it's more than just an army
that that's for your mercenary forces that go overseas and attack other countries but at home here
number one i am one hundred percent for total gun control
i
yes i am not a member of the national rifle association and i don't believe in hunting and i just have had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate and i really feel that we have to do something
hm
um-hum
no there's only one problem i have with the whole thing though is you know when they do it i think our biggest problem is yes the
the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available
i think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available and the types of the weapons i mean there is no
right there is
there is no reason for it i mean and you know when people say you know well my god they're
cutting into my civil liberties and all this no i take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there then somebody is taken away from my civil liberties
and
maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun control that's really not what i meant by i mean we need control we've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the in the in the public
um-hum
hm
um-hum
yes all right you sound like you're into the technology of it which is yeah i agree and you know and again i'm my entire family are
they are all hunters and you know they don't appreciate my stand and i have no i really have no problem with sports hunters
i really don't it's just that when they come on and they say they need an uzi in order to do some accurate or
decent deer hunting
and the issue is the issue is becoming the focus and not what is actually happening with guns i think something will happen there will
okay do you have a boat
do you like to boat oh yeah
what kind
oh a ski boat though
we have a seventeen foot invader
and yeah it's we've only had it a couple of years but it's so much better than the other boat we had a an older trihold that was just horrible because i mean god you felt every wave
but the invader is really neat i really like it it's got the bow up and the bow down and all that stuff so it's kind of fun
we didn't i think i'd go nuts
oh really
oh
yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat
oh well there's been one sitting up in addison for the last few days that's really neat it's a baja but it's huge
i think it'd be more boat than i'd want right now
huh well eventually my husband thinks that we are going to sell everything that we own and live on a boat in the caribbean
well i think i could for awhile i do not know but yeah
but i'd i mean i'd have to get away from him eventually but another friend of mine has said that he and his wife are going to do that and he said that they're just planning to take their bikes and then go into port every once in a while and
say see you later and take off and he said that they thought they could keep their sanity that way
yeah i do not know if i could live on a boat
exactly
well that's another good thing about our boat is going out on the weekends at least we're forced to talk to each other and there's nothing to interrupt us and it's just so relaxing
so even if we do not ski but now that the water is warm enough we have been skiing a lot and my little seven year old nephew is coming next week so i guess i will have to teach him how to ski
yeah i think that's about when i learned
do you ski
oh yeah do you have your own ski and everything
but it was really neat last weekend we were sitting out in the in the boat and a school of shad came bebopping across the water and he threw the line out and caught a fish on the first cast
yeah that was really neat i had never seen the shad do that so that was pretty cool
so anyway
yeah i was amazed
really did it have a cabin
yeah
oh really
huh
it must've been pretty big
huh
how much was it
oh my i wonder how old it was it very old
huh was it inboard outboard
you don't know how big the engine was
yeah well ours will be paid off in ninety three and i will feel like i hit the lottery then i guess but
it's pretty nice it's nice to have it's a good way to get away kyle is afraid that he doesn't want me to pull it by myself yet but the way our drive way is there's like a forty five degree turn so i do not think i could get it out even if i wanted to
we go to lewisville and but it's really nice i mean we've talked about getting the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because now it does not get dark until nine o'clock but
it's really nice having it in the garage because then if we want to go to whitney or you know grapevine or any other place it's just there and we can load up and go
so plus i don't have any idea how much slip rental is it probably get a little expensive i would think
whoa
i think i'll keep it in the garage
just to have a place to park you boat
oh that's true
well that's what we were coming back from arkansas i guess last october and there was a marina for sale
but yeah i can probably do that for a while
yeah
really
i do not know a lot of people say boats are just a hole in the water that you pour money into but we've been real fortunate we have not had any problems
so but kyle's real good with the maintenance i think that that's real important so fortunately he knows what he is doing there
well just the minor stuff we took it in for its hundred hour check up and all that stuff but you got to do stuff like that to keep the warranties good
so that's fine i can live with that
yeah really yeah you kind of need them to go hand in hand i guess
yeah because i mean i there's times you know even our weekends where we don't have time to go and it's sad because you think god you are paying all that money for the boat and it's just sitting there
so but it's well worth it when we do get to go and hopefully it will be good weather this weekend so we can go
i hope so
well i enjoyed talking to you okay maybe i will get you again sometime all right bye-bye
well harris what was your most recent woodworking project
oh all right
all right
huh well maybe a small business of woodworking on the side then do you have a lot of woodworking tools
yeah
that's almost a whole -nother world i think
well
yeah
well i subscribe to both fine home building and fine woodworking
are you familiar with those
huh
huh
yeah
yeah well the thing i like about the two magazines i mentioned is they're so inspirational
that's right that's right i
i think i like the fine home building better
in terms one of my projects is adding molding to a rather plain house
that's right that's right
that describes it perfectly
uh-huh
i know
i know
i i've been through that do you do a lot of projects or is this is this just mostly a hobby
oh okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh we have a lot of those at the building where i work and i think they're made out of teak
does it whit too badly or what
huh
sure
yeah
of antiques and semi-antiques
and a little bit of repair work on that sort of thing
uh-huh
oh is that right
huh
i had no idea
is the lab any place close to the mall or is it
do you have any recycling going on in your community
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
so they used to pick this stuff up but just throw it away but
oh really
it's my impression that it's rare to find someone who will
recycle magazines
the glossy magazines yes
and then they charge you for the service
uh-huh
was this something that was voted on or
hum by the city council or something
uh-huh
uh-huh
whether
you take advantage of it or not
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
right
well we have
and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers bottles cans
and cardboard
and it used to be free
for a few weeks then they
sent out little flyers saying hey we still want to do this for free but we're not quite making ends meet and we'll take donations
and i
i'm i don't not sure if anybody really sent donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now
i'm not sure what we're going to do i mean it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to put out
so it may work out monetarily
okay for us to be charged for it
and since they are private if they charge too much they'll people will just start throwing it in the trash
right we pay for our trash pickup but this isn't the trash people
this is another this is
carl carl's recycling
and he comes around with a truck of his own so it's completely
private and nonmandatory
and people just put things out on the curb
he's competing with some
very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables
so it's
um-hum
yes i've heard that yeah it's
they have all this used newsprint that people don't want
right
do i recycle cans that's about it
yeah my
no because there's no really place i think if they had more visible places for you to drop stuff
people would do it more instead of you know it's because it's hard it's bad enough you got to save the stuff but then you got to go find somewhere to put it if they
and then at home i just save cans because i know where that is that's like on the way to work but i don't know where the paper and the bottles and all that stuff is but i think if like apartment complexes
how many kids you got
oh
uh-huh
yeah
oh i yeah my husband my husband hauls apples
um-hum
he's independent he hauls them for anybody
yep
yep
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i think if they would if they would have it more where you can get it
get to it you know like in different places like apartment complexes they got trash cans why not put the dumpsters for different things and that way people would find it better
but if you can't find it
who's gonna save it you know because after a while you get tired of saving newspapers i mean
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
yeah but see those are
they can't
yeah i think because of the disease and all that going around they don't know
you know they're calling them like what do you call it contaminated yeah
huh-uh
they use pair of gloves for every patient they see
they use gloves for everybody i mean the nurse you the dentist his assistant everybody in there has on gloves and then
uh-huh
yep but they don't recycle those so
now i didn't use those i had a diaper service
in the service because i couldn't my son was allergic to something in the plastic
that i couldn't use them it's just he couldn't wear them for some reason i don't know what it was
but he couldn't wear them because of the something was he was allergic to something
so i had to put regular diapers on him boy that was a you know for a while i had the service but then you know after i didn't have it the whole time but the first i think the first
yeah because you can you just wash those you know so
yeah
you can return those
uh-huh
no huh-uh if they did that i would take them back all the time because i go to the same store all the time
yeah
but i think if they'd do it more with the with the money like a nickel or penny even though people think it's not enough but if you have enough
people don't a quarter's a quarter it doesn't matter
you know my son could take a quarter and go buy him a candy bar or something but i
okay well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows
and they kind of are in different spectrums i think one of them's quantum leap
and the other one is night court and i think i think they're real different i mean i don't think they have anything in common quantum leap has i mean quantum leap is kind of
a comedy in its own way i guess but mostly it's kind of science fiction and it's adventure and things like that and then night court is just pure you know weird fun you know just
it's nothing serious about it at all so i don't know why the two of them happen to be my two favorite shows but they that's the way it is so
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's right i mean
well they really have changed him though if you've watched it this season he's becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything but he's involved in that charity
and it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show
that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff
and he you know was too depressed you know to so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever but
um-hum
right that's good point
so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows though
okay
deedee
yeah i agree
yeah i can't remember what her name is but
um-hum well but see i read an article about in tv guide about hunter and about his you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them
and they say that there was that there was like a conflict between her and him that they never really could get her into any character that they could use i mean you know
yeah the second one the blonde you know if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners
yeah
and even at the beginning deedee and hunter
would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would do would go this but it seemed like it was almost two different organizations
you know like hunter was the boss and this other girl was not and you know you kind of you're wondering you know well when did this happen you know
so yeah i kind of agree with that
well i'm afraid that's what they really wanted to do
um-hum
yeah well see there was that spark between deedee and hunter for a while but they like started it and then they'd pull it back and they'd start it and pull it back and that really made it a very interesting
show to where you never really knew
which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that i kind of thought was good but
you know it's i guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever and so i guess that's what they decide to do
yeah
but it's always been a formula for tv that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married
that the show ends up you know dying
a good example of this and you know this is well maybe it's not a good example i've been watching
nickelodeon all last week because they had what they called maximum smart they had get smart for ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night -til six or -til five o'clock the next morning
all the get smart episodes you could ever see well the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married and that was i mean that was the killer the series died right after that because well go ahead
um-hum the same thing
yeah the it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and
and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the character's
personalities well especially after they get married
couple of examples would be well like i said this one about max or get well smart the female character barbara feldon
she had been at the beginning the intelligent one the one who always solved the things and figured out and kept
max from getting real messed up well whenever they got married she got dingy
you know why would they do that
it made no sense
yeah
unfortunately that's probably true
um-hum
well do you watch
what is that show who's the boss
it's that's on tuesday nights i think
yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but as i've seen it they've done sort of the same thing to where they've they started to let them get together and then they pulled them apart
and i think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them get together then you lose part of what the show's all about so i always thought that was kind of weird
um-hum
hum right
well do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages a secret or at least they keep it quiet
yeah i mean
yeah
now like madonna and sean penn now i don't particularly like either one of them but
their marriage was so highly publicized
that there was no way that they could stay together
or at least that's the way i look at it
so i don't know
yeah i would think so
um-hum
yeah it's it wouldn't be easy
so hum
well that's kind of interesting
so
well i guess that's about all we need to do isn't it
well i think i've you're the second female i've talked to
so
uh-huh bye-bye
all right sandra what we are supposed to talk about this morning are and i can tell that you're must be an expert child care services
and my first question is
what criteria
is normally applied by parents when they are selecting child care
what are they looking for in other words
um-hum
what age would you say a child should be before you could start applying this business of teaching them a little bit preschool information we what six or seven or four or five
uh-huh
they do seem to have a very much improved intellectual sort of a spirit they're bright they look around and they know what's going that's that i guess that's as important to say
yeah
um-hum
yeah
with them and i didn't consider a lot of these little details that we're talking about
but now that my grandchildren are growing up i look at them in a totally different style
i watch very closely their activities when i see them and like and i can tell when they're speaking more clearly the next day and when they are understanding situations more carefully
and i don't remember doing it maybe i did automatically with my own children but i'm just looking with a much higher technical detail at the grandchildren
well i wish i did i'm still working but i'll be retiring soon
it it's just that with grandchildren they are for a short period of time and you just look at them and you absorb anything you can from them and
you start comparing when you get from them with what you got from your own children
but it was really a different environment
something like that
well let me ask you this is it difficult to find a day care when you have a specific criteria of your own is that is that hard to find
i see uh-huh
um-hum
that's true yes
sure
my daughter my oldest daughter lives in amsterdam holland
and they have over there what they call a creche
and so her two children go to this creche which is a an all day well about a six hour
personally i think it's good
i think
there's a lot of things that
you can learn from
helping other people and doing things that need to be done
and as i look around i see most of the things that i enjoy like i just got back from vacation and the freeways were built by somebody else paid by somebody else and
and wouldn't hurt to do some of that myself
how shall i say it service in the far east for my church
yeah
latter day saint church
and
so it was
it was it was a great thing and i know some other people that who've that have come back from that and joined the peace corps and
you know went on contributing and like i say in every case they benefited and i'm they have lifelong happy memories about
volunteer service of some kind
so how about you
yes
yeah well that's part of the how shall i say it that's part of the experience i think because not every
overall the benefits of volunteer service
are just infectious they get you remember the people you helped and it's not all money
and it's really useful to making you well like i say feel like you contribute i know after i spent my time in the far east i came back and i said well
of all the bad things i've done in my life and of all the times i wimped out and haven't done anything at least i've done something
for that period of time
you know it's how shall i say it
it's not a cure all but
the other thing that i've that i like i say i feel is that there's a lot of people out there that just have tons of time and
they don't know what they're going to do with their life and as you pointed out if they've get out and see if life from a
from a different perspective
and let's see what else
i think the only difficulty is going to be
if it becomes
well i think we'd have to learn a lot from the european style because i know that in america there's
sometimes there's a tendency to let everybody do their own thing to the point that it might become
i basically
listen to the news from the tv that's probably the only time i get a chance to
take a look at it is the evening news and then if i'm lucky i might be able to hear something through news wise but other than that
now that's probably how i get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me about it through
you know through conversation or whatever but most of the time it's through the news in the evening so
newspapers no i'm not too much in reading newspapers not that i don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that but
part of it is because i just don't feel like i need the need to have them
with watching the tv or whatever we get our weekly news around the area and i might
look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state but
the majority of the time now i don't get a daily newspaper where you know i get tons of news coming in that kind of stuff so
you read it in the morning then yeah
um-hum
sure
to see if they did it or if they criticize you or put something in there wrong sure
um-hum sure
sure exactly
uh-huh
sure
that's
that's kind of like you said then we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and
while i'm cooking supper the tv's on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what's going on and very seldom do i catch the ten o'clock so by that time
you know news is probably what i hear through the grapevine or whatever but
unless there's a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the tv to find out what was going on
but other than that no it's
exactly
exactly
sure
yep yeah
um-hum yeah
yeah
well it brought kind of more of a vivid look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and
just a lot of different things but
yeah that's true you know you know a lot of people that read the news to newspapers to get the news of what's going on and other people that you know
do it differently or don't even watch any news at all so
but
exactly happens sure that's
oh sure a clip you know a sentence or two and that's about it of what went on and they have so much other information to cover in just a short period of time sure
makes sense
yeah
yeah
um-hum
so you're right on the coast line you're not further up you're
um-hum
sure
sure i suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and
things like that sure yeah
yeah that's about the only time in the in the summer
if you're watching tv for the weather even though it's very hard to predict what's going on they'll kind of say well there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever this is the what is expected but a lot of times things happen and change here
so drastically so fast
you know where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever so
um-hum
um-hum
sure
yeah that's
sounds pretty good so
anyway i don't know if our time is getting up here or it's got to be fairly close to that
and
the last couple of years and people have really you just accepted that of course the soldiers and then the civilians they haven't done the civilians yet but
personally i don't think see anything wrong with it i think it's a protection to employers and to employees and everybody else if
uh-huh
you bet
i really like it the way they do it in the in the military they go by social security numbers and they take the last number and
so it
and it or just pick a last number social security numbers and that's the way they do it and it works really well
and i work with recruiters a lot and they have
they have it monthly with recruiters
no they do it that way but well it's every three months excuse me every three months
and they have we have about oh a hundred and fifteen recruiters in our area
but
no hasn't come up i don't know i
it is mandatory that they're tested for drugs
and if drugs are found in the system
then they're barred for enlistment for six months and then they can come back once and test again and if it's still positive then they can't join
they've really cracked down on that and i think that's good because the source of the bad crime of reputation for drugs
but it's surprising since they've been on well the first couple of months this has been around for about a year and a half
the first few months there was quite a few that were disqualified and since then you just never hear of it i guess the word got out and the kids know that if they want to commit and join then they have to be straight
the only thing that's kind of scary if you eat one of these buns with cinnamon with these poppy seeds on it
and that would show up
it's kind of strange but yeah they tell them that if they
if they're going to if they come into the motel to stay overnight
prior to being physical and tested and then so forth they tell them not to eat anything with poppy seeds on it a hard roll if they're having lunch or something or dinner but
well i'm not sure and it just shows that they're
but they specify that or just tell them that they'll have to kind of be careful well and it's the same with alcoholic beverages they test for that too
and i think it's great i really do i mean
but in the work place i feel that it should be something that the employers have the right to do if they want
to protect everyone concerned and
the only problem i can see and i've heard is the fact that if they
if the test whoever runs the test they've got to make sure they run it correctly so it's not a misreading on it or something
and that that's happened in some instances i guess
but
i think they're pretty well i've what i've heard and especially the ones that test the soldiers they
they make sure they run them correctly and have the right person with right sample and everything but
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i especially the alcohol part of it that's a that's a thing that
yeah right you really can you can and
well dave what's your favorite magazine
parenting and car and driver i see
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i see
uh-huh
yeah do they have they looked at the consumer reports articles on cars
um-hum
yeah well i think it's the april issue i do get that one and the april issue always compares all the new cars
and that's it's invaluable when if you're shopping for a new car even if you're looking for an old one because it tells you history of repairs and that sort of things on different models
so i think it is a worthwhile magazine i get newsweek here but i never have time to read it
yeah the
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah that year end book that consumer reports put out is sometimes a little condensed too you may not get the full article in those
not always the case but sometimes
another magazine i enjoy but i i'm way behind on them are smithsonian
the photography is so good and the and the articles are fascinating there's always something in that magazine
and so
well probably i get money and that's another one i don't have time to read
and rather strange one i suppose i get fine home building
you know if i ever build the ultimate dream home or something i'll know how to do it
no i own one yeah
not too many no
yeah well home magazines is pretty good too it helps you out with minor repairs and of course the usual popular science and popular electronics
they often have
articles that help you repair things
but i have to confess i've never read car and driver
or parenting as a matter of fact
yeah
yeah
yeah something could've really have fallen apart by then couldn't it
yeah well i think in general i'm like you i tend to get my current events out of the newspaper or worse yet on the ten o'clock news on tv
oh is that right
yeah i
oh tv guide
yeah
oh
i haven't i haven't gotten tv guide in years i used to subscribe to it many years ago like twenty years ago or so
oh
uh-huh
well lynn what do you think should elderly be cared for in the home or do you think they're always better off in a nursing home or are there any answers to something like that
yeah
well my mother who's seventy is has living with her my eighty nine year old grandmother
but
no
no and my grandmother's pretty self-sufficient she did have a mini stroke recently
which is left her just a tiny bit addled
but i don't think she's any place close to needing a nursing home
oh how sad
yeah
um-hum
yes
that must have been very difficult for her to make that decision
i think one of the toughest parts about the decision would be finding the home
i know in texas we hear so many of so many abuses in nursing homes
i don't know where you'd start
yeah
oh yes and probably underpaid in a lot of cases i mean i think that's treated as pretty much unskilled labor
yeah
i wonder if the church run nursing homes in general are better than the others
yeah
my late in-laws lived at leisure world
for a number of years but i actually they moved away from there with a daughter before they needed the final care i guess it had graduated levels of care or something in that facility i don't know if you're familiar with that or not it's in southern california
um-hum
she lived with us when i was a little girl for about three or four years and then we had to put her in a rest home and
yeah she had to have nurses care
and yeah it was a really hard decision because i she had nine kids and they had all decided that between the nine of them they could keep her at their home
but her health just failed so much that they couldn't do that she needed an iv and things
oh wow
oh my goodness
uh-huh
and then there's just the grandkids
oh wow
yeah that's what's neat is when they don't have to go into a rest home or anything
yeah my grandpa lived to be ninety four and
his grandma or his wife was ten years younger than him and she kept him at home his about the last two years of his life she had him in a hospital bed
anyway where their back bends and stuff and the bones deteriorate and it really did a toll on her lifting him and stuff but she
she would have died before she let anyone put him in there in a rest home
but when my grand when my one grandma that did go in the rest home we found a really nice one the you know we'd go visit every night
and she only
and i you know we felt really bad for putting her there and stuff she was unconscious and so
i don't know a lot of people say she didn't even know she was there but
still it was nice to be with her and stuff
well nowadays the expense is going so crazy i mean some people they need it but they can't afford it and those are the families i feel so bad for
you could lose your whole retirement or whatever just
taking and you know nowadays a lot of kids are taking care of their parents you know because they can't afford a rest home or whatever
and that does a double toll on the kids
i don't know if i could ever put my parents in a rest home but
i don't know how we would afford it either
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
right
living all together weren't they
yeah
i really don't think i'd want to
does she have a home or an
oh right up in ti out there
oh right
yeah i just hit one then
it i got to this is going to be fun are you republican or democrat
okay well i was i was i'm a democrat so i was going to say if you're a republican boy we would really have a good time
was bought for the war and how successful it was though when it comes to the budget they say well the democrats control all the money and they're the ones wasting all the money and i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want you know i get a kick out of that but anyway the subject go ahead you first
yeah i don't think it's over i think that so many other things have taken over in the media
but i think it was just plain greed and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks go ahead loan your money out you know
yeah i was talking to someone i can't remember who it was but he was a small businessman and he said that the banks were calling he borrowed some money and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away
they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property and yeah there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i'm concerned
not just a couple
right
well i agree a hundred percent
oh yeah
it may have started with hud too i noticed that hud was in terrible shape and that was property and they lost a lot of money there and then some of these big these rich people started to even
murchison here who owned the cowboys had a lot of property down in florida this was several years ago and he lost you know all of his money before he died
be more than what you paid for it and they just never even got conservative with our money at all
right
yeah
well now the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all reaganomics for you know you spend your way to prosperity and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls i thought well
that was the philosophy you know just keep spending until taxes are lower and i thought that's not going to work you know and i knew that it wasn't going to work originally
and it hasn't worked now you know
right no doubt no doubt
oh yeah i agree with that but there's got to be some control and apparently there was you know
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh no i
right
and not high quality ones at that you know
well i do have a lot of confidence in the american people and the economy and everything else i feel bad when i see the inefficiency even here at ti you know and i think that the
it still a lot of the workers don't understand that they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them you know
right
i know and i when i of course i'm in facilities and i work with a lot of mechanics and i just cannot understand why they're just happy to
spend their time here rather than produce you know and they think that well i'm paid anyway so it doesn't matter you know
right
yeah oh really
you don't sound like a nonexempt jim
you don't sound like a nonexempt
you're too informed they're very they're very not interested they wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now
i guess i'm dealing with too many texas mechanics here i don't know really i'm being a yankee i guess i'm letting my yankee come out you know
yeah
well that's good
no right i mean that's good that you're degreed
your time will come there we i know a few people that would
oh really what are you in a tech like do you do technician work or something or
oh quality okay
yeah
oh yeah well now is really terrible i'm management level facilities and when the cuts came three of us got bounced back and so we're just i'm calling you from work i'm covering
weekends and nights now i'm one of the manager reps there's three of us to cover in dallas facilities and just we're essentially standby and problems all nights and weekends that's my i only get one weekend off a month right now
i call it my recession job
yeah
yeah
yeah it
banking
i think that not only ti but a lot of it when they talk about there was one point i was going to make i think the last i heard and i have to admit i'm not as informed that much but there's something like eighty six billion that they admit well i always double that i figure well
if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty six billion it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes and so if that's true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was that went down the tube somewhere
yeah it's amazing really it's amazing that
oh yeah i know what you mean
course your value of homes up there are pretty good i mean here they're not really that high but are they pretty good up there
oh really
well we're in the metroplex here you know and it i die every time companies like general dynamics they lost several contracts and i don't know if you noticed yesterday
you probably don't pay attention to the bell helicopter you know they were going to have this big award and secorski got it which was boeing secorski this which is up in the north somewhere you know
and i don't know how bell didn't get it
well i don't i they were advertising here that it was bell ti was getting the electronics with bell and so it was a double one that bell is in the metroplex and two that ti was doing the electronics for them
and they advertised that it was ti bell ti bell and then all of a sudden secorski got it yeah secorski boeing doesn't need the money
something i almost think there's some politics around here because the metroplex here in the dallas fort worth area the
with ti i don't know if ti has lost as much as everybody else but general dynamics and ltv and bell have lost project after project you know
oh okay
yes
um-hum
music no i think i might like dancing to it but i don't like listening to it
oh
uh-huh what's the old country music like
uh-huh
oh okay
that's the kind you like you mean
oh okay well i guess i like the blues a lot and i guess you could say it's similar as far as
yeah me too so i guess i like everything except heavy metal and
most rap i don't like
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
okay
okay yeah
um-hum
well i used to a long time ago but since i've started back into school now i haven't really done that much i've been pretty busy
but
so no i haven't i you know i used to go out and dance a lot but i don't do that anymore either so
well no i went to school and got a degree and then i worked for awhile and then i just started i started back a year and a half ago changed direction
yeah how old are you
oh okay
all right
yeah and i didn't really start getting into music until i went to college because my parents didn't really have music in the house put it that way
yes
so i'm always behind i'm not i'm never really up to date on all that stuff but i know what i like when it's when i like a sound a certain kind of sound yeah
um-hum
okay
uh-huh
huh
yeah
oh really
oh row
yeah
kind of stuff the old stuff
and
bryan what kind of music is does what songs does he play
uh-huh
i think i've heard summer of 69
yeah
so
no
yeah so
um-hum do you like
like someone recent like enya have you ever heard of her she's not rock but
she's from ireland
and she's gotten some she's been on like the top
ten i guess or whatever
well i do a little bit i just do mainly you know change the oil and i'll do an occasional tune-up things like that change set of disc brakes
but most of the stuff i have done i just don't have time to fool with it or you know it's just out of my technical expertise
one of each
a foreign and i have a truck
yeah
yeah i don't work on anything foreign
well you've got to have a different set of tools for it and everything else too so
yeah metric well even some american cars have that now but
they're still a little bit over all simpler you know to work on but
i feel like if i can afford to have it done i'm going to have it done
yeah
um-hum
yeah automatic choke
how much did that cost you to have that fixed
yeah
not cheap like it used to be
yeah i've had we have a volvo and i had some steering problems
and it ended up being the entire rack and pinion steering assembly
and by the time i got everything done
it was twelve hundred bucks
so something that small and that minor well it's not really minor but something that small can cost that much money
well it's five years old
but
but still it doesn't have that many miles it's got just over sixty five thousand miles on it and rack and pinion steerings
i don't think i've ever heard of one going out
the guy that i talked to that replaced it he said i just he said we've never really had to replace one
we've had to go in and do some adjustments but never replace one but the actual gear teeth on this one had broken
so i think it was a defect and i tried to get the volvo corporation to cover it but they just refused to do it
so i just rather than get tied up in a bunch of you know garbage i just went ahead and got it done and to heck with it
but and then the truck i have i have
i've had just virtually excellent luck with it and other than taking in for just regular warranty work and things like that it's been a real good truck
they're good cars
i had a i had a honda accord it was
trying to think what year it was
i think it was an eighty eight or eighty seven eighty seven
and
it's the was the lxi with the fuel injection is that what you have
i think it still has fuel injection there's i think the dx is the one that does not
but they are probably one of the nicest running cars i've ever driven
they run good and they're and they're peppy
yeah i will i don't i don't think i'd ever buy another volvo i bought it mainly for my wife and daughter for safety more than anything and i thought well it'd be an investment we'll be able to keep it for ten or twelve years
and i don't think i'd buy another one only because the maintenance costs are very high
and that's just a little bit out of my range it's enough just to buy it without having the other problems but
i will definitely go to
now go back to honda or mazda or something like that next time
um-hum
oh really
hum
that's been i think until they get the reliability up
i don't you know other than trucks i've had always had good luck with american trucks but with cars i i've not had much luck with american cars especially general motors
but you know i look at reliability and you know like stuff like tires and belts and stuff like that actually
you can buy the parts cheaper for foreign cars if you buy them and put them in yourself
but if you have to have it done of course it ends up costing you the installation fee but
i have had if i had to say dollar for dollar spending on foreign and as opposed to american i spent far less on the foreign cars
long term a lot a lot more and then you add the fuel savings on top of it
so my money's on foreign cars until the american cars can meet the standards
well that that's interesting that you say that because if you'll start looking now at some of the hondas and some of the mazdas and a lot of the car companies now are beginning to scale up you know like the lexus
see those cars if you'll go look at them they're as big as some of the general motors cars
if you if you put them side by side and i didn't really notice it until someone pointed it out he says well if you'll look and see what's happening
foreign cars
are able to keep the same or keep good gas mileage good reliability but they're scaling up whereas the americans now are scaling down and they can't improve the gas mileage anymore
so the japanese have definitely beat us in both sides of the game
they thought you know build them small cheap you know and little repair
and you know get them hooked and then start slowly adding stuff on
and people like the reliability but they also like the size and now they're sizing up they've got the reliability and they've got the gas mileage you know
that's right and with american cars and the warranties you don't know
yeah except i've got a ford truck
and i know a lot of people that have ford trucks
and really they're very maintenance free
from i now i speaking only from trucks
i don't know that's surprising because you know everybody i know that has a ford car has had nothing but trouble with it but they have a ford truck and they're virtually flawless
the undercarriage and everything else if you put them next to a chevy or another type of truck
american truck you can't even come close to a ford
and that's why i buy ford trucks
mine runs like a top it i've like i say i've had absolutely nothing wrong with it other than taking it in for normal maintenance
and i put over a hundred miles a day on it
and i've never i've never had trouble with it
so i'll buy ford trucks but i'll buy foreign cars
i know it's kind of kind of crazy but i don't know but until they until they meet the standards that you know that i'm used to anyway that you know i'll buy what whatever i get you know that's best for my money
yeah
they're good cars i will say that you probably made a good choice
in that one
but how about have you had tires changed on that car
um-hum
did you put the same kind of tires back on it did you
why did you choose a private school
public school
oh has he and how does he like it
so he's been there all time
how big of a school is it
a hundred per grade that's a good size
so they don't that's good
um-hum
right
but seems to me that kids these days
and makes me a little nervous that students don't seem to show that respect and
no heavens no
no you wouldn't
and the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what i understand
i think that's wrong
i think we need to
right
for other people and
well how do you think that's happened you think our society's just stopped talking out or this generation's just kind of changed a little bit
right
right
that just isn't coming through is it
no i mean i remember
well it was a big thing when they let girls wear levi's we used to have to wear dresses and then you had to go to dresses they had to be a pantsuit and it was polyester and it had to be matching and
yes exactly
yes
yes so it's really changed it's
do does this school your son goes to do they required to wear a uniform or
uh-huh yeah there are quite a few of your
are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the okay
oh my
you
you are experienced i would say
well i agree i have done something like that too only not nearly as extensive
but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home after having a
one that was historical looking
yes
uh-huh
well maybe you can make that one charming and make a little bit money
yes
well we just moved to charlotte from enid oklahoma
so i know of what you're talking about as far as the market was concerned and i'll tell you we had kind of a charming house it was a cedar shake house and very weathered and
it was about fifty years old but not really
traditional looking particularly
and so i tried to make it after i sold my business i in i spent almost three years redoing
and i considered it a full time job
and when we did we kind of had planned this trek to the east because we're both originally from this part of the country
and so i think some of the things that i did paid off for instance one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you was something i did on the outside i love old estate sales
i happened to go to just a little estate sale that just a little white frame house where the couple was very old and had gone into nursing homes and
all the men started going down to the barn
and so i well shoot i'm going to
yes i'm going to the barn too
they auctioned some tools and things like that but then they went over and started
auctioning this big stack of bricks
and so well i thought gee i've been wanting to do some brick walkways for a time
anyway it ended up after some pretty heavy bidding that i got all those bricks for forty dollars
and so my husband and i loaded bricks in his pickup truck for days
but what we ended up with was about four thousand
for forty dollars
and so what we did we had built a deck on the back of that house but it needed and it was quite large out to into the yard but on either side of it to the ends of the house
it just needed to be all tied together so we made brick patios
and walkways
and so for and he did the digging which was about six inches but i figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and placed most all the bricks
and it turned out beautifully
yes well it nearly killed me
i hated to leave it
um-hum
no we
well i
well no i didn't have that trouble because
and then we swept sand in between but it was an error to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever you just put them together as close as you can
um-hum
yeah well and i also used a rubber hammer a lot to you know if it wasn't quite level or something i'd just get that rubber hammer and
and you know i think that they could if they have problems with sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a
oh a fairly regular basis for a while anyway
yeah is it diazinon or what is it that will dursban or something like that
dursban i think in this area or most all areas they use you know for ticks and fleas and you know they're awful hard to do anything with
yeah i bet dursban would do it
yeah i think you probably just need to make sure that it dries very well before she lets her cats out or something like that
yes
wow
oh good
uh-huh
yes
okay i think we're all set there hopefully
well unfortunately that's the typical picture though
is your mother-in-law currently living in a nursing home or anything
have you guys thought about the financial burden
of caring for
your mother-in-law as far as putting her in a nursing home down the road
well my mother my grandmother is in a place similar to that where she has emergency buttons throughout the throughout the house or actually the apartment
and it's
a very negative feeling when you walked in the building
and now she's been very fortunate
in that she's almost like living in a small home
and she still has an a large maintenance staff take care of the place look after her
provide
basic busing services and travel
okay
okay
oh
okay
um-hum
more parent input
um-hum
well do you have school age children
oh so you're definitely more
involved at least in the schools school system my children are grown so
so
for city council do you all have a mayor or
you do yeah we do in houston too
yeah
yeah she's still she's still there but it looks like she may have some
the opposition or they're trying to beat them she's been in for so long so we may hear some interesting things about her before election time comes up
this time but she's
been pushed out
but i don't know if you would consider that a trend or not
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
and they just she just lost out to someone from the dallas area like assistants somebody who's an one of the assistants in your i'm not sure what the name maybe it was another woman
so
maybe so yeah maybe so
uh-huh
lots of school principals seem to be women in least in the houston area
i've noticed over the years that my kids were in school in fact
fact i don't even remember any
school that they went to that there wasn't a women principal from elementary school on up
uh-huh
so
yeah but then again you know it would be nice to have more you know the majority of teachers
seem to be women it would be nice to have but the problem is the pay scale probably it's because
you know women go into teaching probably not so much for the money but
for the satisfaction and that's just what they want to they want to do whereas i think if you're a college professor
probably the pay is much better and you tend to see more i think you see more
well i don't know it seems like there are a lot of a lot more men at least in the college level
you can teach
substitute
right
uh-huh
do you have any idea how much a substitute teacher would make per day i'm sure they pay them by the day
well i mean that's good part-time money
yeah but it's not
no
just somebody
yes it's true
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
which i think is something that has to happen in order to
to make it happen right
well a couple weeks ago i was at the houston international festival which is you know in the downtown area and
the friend a friend of mine that was with me commented on how clean
you know when you have an event like that of course you know there's just food and everything else and of course they have the you know the places to throw the stuff but you really they were really use they really use it and the
because in the past you know it seemed like i can remember people just throw it down they don't care but you're finally getting to the point where it's just kind of second nature to find some place to throw it
well you're probably younger than i am because i you know but i can remember
probably in the early seventies going out on you know taking our boat out and stuff like that and looking for places for trash bins and stuff and that was very new at that time you know
so it's yeah it really hasn't been that long i mean it's probably twenty years or so that you know it really began
so yeah
uh-huh
that's true
how about the representation that you have on the city council is it
have to be plead ignorant here
are you a tier or oh really that's great my daughter talked to a student in general most of them people doing this are tiers but i guess customers too huh
yeah ti's got a lot of advances in it really hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us we sure need the business okay current events you got the question you can go first here since i called
huh you're the opposite of me i drive
an hour each way to work and so if i just use time and not in say one which quality is the best i that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio
i really of course you would of you're in a different part of the country i really listen to a lot of the talk shows i don't mean the gossip ones but there's a lot of
on the weekends when i do chores or whatever i'm a radio hound i guess i take the radio with me when i'm working on my car the lawn or whatever
and turn on they have everything from lawn work lawyers news veterinarians all kinds of items so i'm a real radio buff especially on the when i'm doing chores
yeah i find it surprising because a lot of times here you know i'll talk to some people here and i'll mention someone's some talk host
and i'll expect them to have an opinion well i don't like him and i don't listen they don't even know
you know what the what the guys name is bruce williams who does financial work all over the united most people haven't heard of bruce williams i mean you probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff
he is in new jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a self made millionaire and he has it i well it's five seventy here i'm trying to it's on cliff i don't know what the
he's on all stations you might remember the name bruce williams and he is again national and talks about a lot of financial things but the here i just get a kick out of
well we do a lot of gardening here so there's we have an excellent gardener here has three hours on sunday and three hours on saturday course that's not exactly current events but i i'm a i am kind of a radio buff
for music
yeah
oh yeah that's good actually
oh that's good
yeah
right
we get
good
oh yeah it comes and goes
yeah
local you mean
yeah
don't they have city council meetings and all that are you into any of that what what's going on in the city council and the and the school boards and all that we have that addition to our paper
oh i see you get it from people then to yeah
yeah you're right
my wife i you know it mentioned the question was do you get it from people too and i can say the same thing you do that my wife is she reads the paper from front to back and so she'll tell me some stuff and she'll always get mad and she'll say you didn't read the
well i always read the sports what am i thinking of the
the commentaries i can't even think of what it is offhand
she's always reading something and she says why haven't you read that and i say i never have time to read it like you do but which i always get a lot of my information from the newspaper through her
so i guess we do get it from people too oh you mentioned cnnn of course i mentioned radio and the cnn tv news you know it's the same thing that's on the radio word for word yeah
well it is cnn exactly because and it because
we have it here at work a matter of fact at ti they have it in the break area cnn
and but the reason i say that because on the radio they'll say and look at this you know and then when i first heard cnn it only started about since the war you know or right before that
and then they would always say and look at this and there'd be pause you know and you'd hear music and stuff and i realized it's the exact commentary that's you have on the news yeah
but it's still good it's still you know it's you don't really miss anything but i do enjoy since the gulf war listen to cnn radio too
where was i go ahead your turn
yeah i heard that yeah
right
right
oh yeah
yeah
i never get home early enough for those five and six
do you have pets
three cats
i see
oh really that's interesting what breed do you do you deal in
i see
oh my
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
sure
yeah i've never done pets you know as a for breeding purposes i've just you know usually always had a pet of some kind around we're at currently we have
two cats i've got a big old seventeen pound black male alley cat and i've got a little seven pound tabby cat that we got from the humane society she's the cutest little thing then i have a twelve year old dachshund that's gosh she's one of the family absolutely
yeah
yeah she's twelve years old she pretty well you know sets the ground rules for the household
that's right the little dog loves to travel of course she's dead asleep before we get to the end of the block and she never you know she sleeps the whole time but she loves to travel
cats of course don't care too much to travel
um-hum
um-hum
right um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's amazing
yeah we've never had a cat of course like i said i guess the only time i've ever had a cat in the car has been in a carrier
maybe if we didn't put them in carriers maybe they would enjoy it more i don't know
probably so probably so
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum could be yeah could be yeah that our little tabby cat is the only cat that i've ever seen or had
that she absolutely hates to be picked up she would rather just do anything than be picked up more normally you know you can pick up a cat occasionally anyway she just absolutely hates it i don't know if it's
yes she does that but she yeah um-hum when she wants to of course
um-hum
um-hum
that's right yeah she does that that's true that's true
um-hum
yes
um-hum just tense yeah absolutely
yeah we've had our two cats declawed because we keep them in the house all the time
well actually the little gray tabby wanders out in the back yard occasionally i have an eight foot security type fence out in the backyard she just kind of goes out and rolls around on the patio and comes back in
but our black cat has never once been outside and has no interest in going outside you can actually leave the door open he'll come to the door and sit down but he never goes outside
um-hum they love to watch the birds
um-hum
um-hum oh yeah they enjoy that
um-hum that's right just hypnotized yeah
yeah
yeah our little cat just wants out maybe once a day that's about all
hum
um-hum
yeah my wife's a cat person until we married i'd never really
oh we'd had a cat occasionally you know and left it outside most of the time we lived in kind of a rural area my wife's a real cat person one time not when we were together but at one time she had a total of like seventeen cats
yeah boy i try to keep her away from the humane society she always want to bring something home you know yeah
um-hum
yeah
that's what she does yeah that's right
yes it really is
um-hum
um-hum
get a kitten yeah um-hum
that's right
um-hum
that's right or move off and leave them
um-hum
oh gosh
um-hum
yeah good grief may have been poisoned or something
yeah um-hum
could be could be
um-hum no not if they've never been out in any weather i wouldn't think so especially
um-hum
yeah
could be yeah that that's too bad it really is it is
absolutely yeah um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
bloodhound
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum yeah they are smart they really are right next door or my neighbor across the street has a couple of labs they're really nice dogs they really are
i see
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yes i've had a german shepherd that did that one time
um-hum
i bet she did
um-hum
it really is our kids are all grown and gone and away from home so our new family is the you know our two cats and our dog we never really
well we had we did have some time to devote to them you know but not nearly as much time as we have now so they've really become children they're real characters they well all of them are
oh yeah they are um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i can't get it can't get her convinced that she really shouldn't try to feed my dog chocolate though she always wants to do a little hershey kisses you know you really shouldn't feed chocolate to a dog especially a small dog
so i kind of have to watch her when she's around the dog
yeah
i guess so yeah for some reason she just really thinks that little dog needs some chocolate of course the dog thinks so too
they do as a matter of fact they do
um-hum
um-hum yeah they love it they really do
no
oh yeah absolutely
i think they can read the price tag on the cans of food
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's strange um-hum
yeah i thought
yeah that's true
um-hum
yeah
that's right that's right yeah i believe this is the first cat that i've ever had that would not even consider eating tuna
oh yeah absolutely and even beef as a matter of fact in small quantities
um-hum oh yeah they love chicken
um-hum
yeah
yeah take care of those cats all right bye-bye
i think my daughter talked to somebody in carolina what is that is it a school up there that
oh great that's wonderful yeah
is that right yeah we thought the opposite we thought well it's going to be ti people and i think they went to customers you know people that use ti computers and everything which is fine
uh-huh
actually they don't talk about much of what it's for but my wife keeps ask asking me and i'm saying well your computer is eventually going to just answer your voice you know they're of course it's very obvious for people with handicaps but in general i guess it would be faster
than typing and everything so
oh yeah it's around the corner
right well i mean it's so ti's been the pioneer on a little advertising for ti not that i know that much about the voice synthesis but they've been working on it for years and years you know they have the speak and spell and all of that of course but they're
they're going to take it much further and i guess in aircraft and all that a lot of it is going to be like you talk to the computer like
two thousand one or two thousand ten when you talk to the computer and
hal right
that was great well what do you think about the metric system you well what do you do out there are you a professor you say
okay
yeah well we're not going to have much to fight over because i do too being an engineer most general motors have pretty much and i'm not too sure about the rest of the cars i'm sure all the japanese cars
uh-huh
right
right well i work on gm cars only and i haven't noticed that much usually the metrics will fit they're so close there's an overlap
you know there's something funny that i haven't really resolved with metric i've got to really go to the store and see if it's true i can't remember the size i think it's
eighteen or something like that i have a set of metric and the old wrenches too and i think that's an exact size of the three-quarters and they don't make it in metric they just skip over it and it
right and i was thinking i've got to get an eighteen because i don't i don't like i'm so used to when i'm grabbing tools for my car to grab for the number you know
because i don't even bother with the unless i'm working on a bumper or something but the engine parts and all are all metric you know
i haven't noticed it mostly being
yeah i mean well on general motors cars it was all metric i use my metrics essentially when i work on the cars i don't well i guess in changing the oil i guess that's i don't even know a nine sixteenths some like that don't remember
but i was thinking i just had a cheap set of metrics in fact
i thought well i guess either i lost the eighteen and then i started to see it in stores and i noticed that the cheaper sets again i'm calling it cheaper sets minus the eighteen i thought well i've got to go to an expensive place so they go to sears and get craftsman tools there
and see if i can't get that eighteen i want a full set you know
i still haven't checked out to see if they do make the eighteen i'm sure they do
well i guess they do i don't know why they wouldn't you know
oh you haven't really
i just thought it was my set so i just didn't have a good quality set you know
i think it's what number did i just say eighteen something that is the same as a three-quarter and it that i i'd rather have it all metric
right
and i bet they have a lot of metrics there i think that the only emotional part might be in miles you know mile signs but that that's that could be last anyway maybe pick a year two thousand say okay we'll slowly change but i think
right
right
upper and lower yeah
right
oh no i don't think so either
i don't even know how many businesses are actually doing it without an order i'm not too sure that the government needs to order it although i guess they would have to in again mileage signs but it
yeah
right
uh-huh
oh yeah i think that i guess it was five years ago or more than when they it failed and i guess people just got tired of talking about it i'm not too sure i guess there was no one really pushing it and no one saying that it was going to mean business to us i think nowadays
we all would say who are in industry and everything we'd say hey this means business we ought to
make everything metric and i just and i see no problem with it at all
uh-huh right yeah
right
well i i'm ready to convert i we probably all thought it was strange you know again five years ago but i don't think there's that many people with reservations anymore i don't know if
sure right
in fact they said it failed and then i guess it has failed but i in general there was still a lot of people that i i'm not sure it's a total failure because so much has converted you know
and i'm not too sure that it's actually not a success more than a failure you know i don't know what percent has actually converted
uh-huh
oh you're absolutely right
you that that's a pet of mine too i just wish we all and us down here in texas of course should all speak spanish
we should have six and eight years automatically of spanish and i push my daughters i've got two daughters and
one is taking latin and one is has taken spanish but not enough of it and i think we down here especially should speak spanish california new mexico and all that really
right
oh yeah
yeah they're working they're out they're studying harder and they're working harder
uh-huh
yeah what are you taking in school by the way you say you're in school
yeah
oh well you know my wife's a well i have a daughter in college you know and who's got down at ut
university of texas i mean and my wife also has gone back for a teaching and english and english as a second language which is you know just teaching kids that are have their native language and not english
oh that's great
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
sure politics and everything you ought to do what you like i'm an engineer and even when i was going through engineering school halfway through they said up don't need any more engineers we've got too many they go through this phase all the time but i think you still should do what you want because
if you're good at whatever you are you know and there's employment
for at least for me because my sister is looking for day care one of the things that we talked about as being very important is the
the in the teacher to the number of kids
because if you've got a large number of children one teacher just won't cut it
right
right
um-hum
right
word of mouth is good something that i don't think many people know about and i this is just something i've heard not something i've actually checked into is that the agency that license
agencies to care for kids like either home or day care you can you can request to see if they have had any problems in the past
is what i've been told
that would be a good a good resource to check
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah
oh yeah
yes and in and there's some places i'm sorry go ahead
right because then there's some places and i and i would don't this would be a big minus for the places there are some places that state that you cannot come in unannounced
you have to have an appointment or you know or whatever and i don't think you know if there hum-um
no never
yes
and i think you've also got to you know whenever you go in and you know talk to the talk to the teachers and look at the toys that they have and the environment that the kids'll be in
yes
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
right
and that's a good situation but it can it can it can turn bad with older children
i was in a day care until i was thirteen just during like in the summers
and what we found was and what finally got me out of this women's home was the fact that she would go off shopping with some of the older kids and leave me there to care for the little ones
you know and i mean this went on for a for a you know good two and a half months
you know and it's her daily thing you know and so if you've got older children that you just don't want to leave at home
sometimes a day a private home or a day care setting is not the best
so but oh and another one is how they discipline
i know depending a couple of the day cares that i went to whenever i was younger one of them disciplined whenever we were outside you hugged a tree and you had time out
whereas you know i've heard of some agencies you know that get into the physical discipline
and you really have to find a discipline that matches your beliefs
or yeah
right because it gets it can it can become very confusing for the child
so
oh yeah
hm
what about
well i'm in i'm in nursing
so one thing i would look at would be
the cleanliness and the care
the that's right the certification of the of the teachers
because there's a new state law mandating that everyone that works in a day care
knows infant and child cpr
but there's a lot of places
okay
right
why did i pick music
oh because i know a little bit about music you know so i thought that i would put that plus i
i like to listen to music
i really enjoy the oldies is what i really listen to most of the time
usually in the fifties
i'm not really sure i think it's a fifties sixties and seventies station that i listen to
oh really i don't know a lot of the
musicians' names or the singers' names but i know a lot of the old songs
oh yeah
uh-huh
yes i have
i played the accordion for seven years and i played the clarinet for seven years also
no i played the accordion until i got into about sixth or seventh grade and then in fourth grade i started the clarinet and i played that all through high school
i was yes
oh okay
uh-huh
and then in concert band i played the bass clarinet
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
i like the low notes better than the high notes so
we didn't have any bass clarinet players so i asked him if i could play it because i was first clarinet and they end up playing a lot of the high notes and i don't
i don't care for the sound of the high notes so i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet and he said sure you know he didn't have anyone to play it so i played it and i really enjoyed it
uh-huh
pardon me
no i really don't go to very many concerts
uh-huh
yes
oh wow
i would love to be able to go see les miserables
oh my gosh
holy smoke
oh i would love to go see that and cats
chorus line
i would love to be able to go see those
they do but i work and i went to i go to college i had just gotten i just graduated from college in may and so i really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them
uh-huh
yeah my brother doesn't even like that kind of stuff and he went to new york a bunch of there was like twenty students from high school that went and he went to new york with them and he saw it and he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen
and he doesn't even like that type of stuff
oh really
oh
oh see now i like that type of stuff but my fiancee doesn't really like it he's more into the new wave music
yeah i guess i don't know either you know
oh i don't know really weird names like the dead milkman or i don't know
well
i pretty i'll listen to anything basically except i don't like the real hard metal rock
i just refuse to listen to that at all i'll even listen to country i don't i like some country
uh-huh
do you like randy travis
uh-huh
oh hank williams junior
oh
uh-huh
oh yeah well those should be good albums
if you have the chance
yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
i don't know maybe you wouldn't like randy travis he's really country himself but
i you know i really enjoy listening to his music
oh i don't know if i were you i would get the greatest hits album
if he had one because you know that would have a mixture of all his you know top songs on it
but we have i think four records of his i can't you know name the names of them off hand but we have i think all his records so far and all my brothers and sisters listen to them even the ones that like the heavy metal
they really enjoy listening to him so
you know maybe if you did like hank williams and garth you know maybe you would enjoy randy travis
uh-huh
yeah
do you know any oh i was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would you know
i mean the women do you like the judds
yeah they go around and they give you these boxes and you fill these boxes up and you take them out and they leave you know
you leave them on the curbstone and every thursday or some such day they come by and pick them up problem is you end up with these boxes in your home that
you know get pretty piled up with such things as glass and tin cans and newspapers and by the time you manage to drag one downstairs you know it's
it's work i just there there's got to be a better way of incorporating it you know somehow so that the manufacturers
that there's an incentive to get it back to them
exactly you know what they oh another thing is that it industry has got to get the mind set that what they'd do affects the you know affects the environment
what they manufacture has got to be and the way it's packaged has got to take that into consideration
but like here in berkeley you can't buy anything from a fast-food place anything like that that's in styrofoam
and you know it's supposedly decomposes i've heard some stories though about
that the thing that lasts longest in a in a the landfills
is not so much the diapers and the things that everyone's yelling about but it's the newspapers
yeah and that's really strange you wouldn't think that but whenever you see you know they're usually wrapped real tight and bundled and under pressure themselves before they get put into the landfill so
inner areas of them are protected
so they don't decompose
isn't that you know you
and all those thousands of trees that gets cut down and you think well geez well newspaper's pretty good because it will you know
indeed well you know there's got to be a fortune in that you know i've got all we've got to do is get together and figure out some way to use these diapers in some useful product you know some
well yeah
or a compost brick you know
you know build your next sky rise out of compost brick you know you'd see the little blue things flickering through it but
i think that might give it a little added
touch of something i'm not sure what
no but that so they're aware of it in texas huh
that makes my heart sore because the last time i was in texas
was on a hunting trip and i was there with a couple of buddies and we had filled up a couple of cans we're going down the road about eighty miles an hour and rolled down the window and just threw them out now
i will have to say that the people i was there with were texans
well i understand that and i think that he's certainly contributed to that
i want you to know you've taken a big load off my chest i've never been able to confess that to anyone and now i've gotten to confess it
well something's got to be done i tell you what i was just watching a show the other night on antarctica
and how they're wanting to make it a
an international park zone so that no one country you know gets down there and trashes it for mining rights or any other thing and
it just it just amazes me you know that there's so little left on this earth where there is that sort of thing and of course the only reason that place is left is because the damn
yeah well they're doing it they you know they're learning and it's inevitably doomed and you know all they got to do is find one speck of platinum or one speck of gold or uranium and
well they not absolutely for sure now there is some off offshore
but as far as on the continent i don't think that anyone drilled a rig on the continent yet
but in any event
i think we all just sort of have to hunker down and do something about it but you know it's like we have all the needs that you know a civilized society has and i think that it's not
all our responsibility to do that i mean the manufacturers would manufacture things in ways that were biodegradable and did not
damage the environment you know i think that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those products
yeah and i think that the people are ready to pay a little extra for that kind of marketing
yeah
yeah well i know i'm willing i just you know it's just i have certain needs for certain things and you know i really can't help it how it is packaged
i have the need for what's there
found ways and i will switch immediately and i think probably the rest of the planet will too
well listen it's been a pleasure talking with you steve right
alright well you take care and listen the next time you run over a beer can in the road
please do
alright bye
okay i guess we're ready to go what are your favorite types of restaurants
do you eat out quite frequently
really and where's the last place that you went to eat
uh-huh
uh-huh
no i haven't
um-hum
oh
okay what areas do you usually eat in do you find
oh okay
do you ever get down to deep elm or greenville or mckinney
i've heard of that i've heard several people say that so it must really be i think it's part vietnamese or something
um-hum
okay
so what would
we haven't tried that one i we belong to the passbook club
and so we tend to use their coupons whenever possible and i know that's in there and i'd like to get over there
well when you have a half price coupon it's not quite so bad then
um-hum
well it's just a shame all the restaurants that you know open and close you seems you go to one and find one that's your favorite and the next thing you know it's gone
well i heard that there are more restaurants per capita in dallas than there are in new york
yes
have you been to the new sonny bryan's down in the west end
well i have not been to the old one for that matter but i thought that since there's a new one opening perhaps it'd be easier to get into
is it over on lemmon or something okay
well that's what i understand you sit at school tables or out on the hood of your car and um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
well i'm from saint louis so believe me it was harder to get in saint louis than it is here
you know i go by that place all the time over on midway
all right
um-hum
we'll have to try that sometime because
well we went to or i went to ralph and kacoos for lunch one day and i've heard good and bad about that the guide always reviews it very poorly
but what i had and then the two guys i went to lunch with they both let me taste what they had and it was delicious
um-hum
well you know how these restaurant reviewers are
well and i've also written down the taste of italy we'll have to try that sometime
that's all right with me
okay and do they have good lasagna
okay because that's my husband's favorite
okay great
okay jean what have you recently painted
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
well i painted a shed this summer that i built and i went and borrowed a
a paint sprayer from a fellow that i know i'm good friends with
my shed and it probably took me about six hours but it was just it's just incredible how much easier it is with a spray gun how much smoother it goes on and even and more professional looking and
i don't know i was just really pleased with it do you use some kind of a power painter rollers or something when you paint or
is that right
you do it the hard way i shouldn't
these sound so hard but
um-hum
um-hum
how do you oh i would imagine
uh-huh
uh-huh how frequently do you have to paint then
how do you prep your wood
is there a fast easy way or is it just the old scraper brush on the outside is i guess what i'm speaking of
hm
inside how do you keep the paint off your carpet
and we're in there with i have to use water base paint and in there with a big wet towel and
about every three minutes i got to stop and clean my paint specks up all over
huh
yes
um-hum
brian white from down there as i mentioned before
sent his wife and my and my wife of course are sisters and they got involved in it they got us involved in it
but kind of enjoyed it
don't always have time to
to pick the phone up and participate
okay
i like well what i usually do is fresh water fishing i haven't been salt water fishing since i was about ten
yeah and i do everything up at lake texoma oh yeah i'm a striper fisherman
oh wherever those little suckers are
but we camp at the lodge texoma state park
over on the oklahoma side and but usually when we go striper when i go out for the big ones we travel down the you know where the channel is down the middle of the lake
we usually chase them down through there
oh yeah oh yeah do you ever go up there
uh-huh
oh it's good fishing up there
oh yeah
uh-huh
oh my gosh that's supposed to be the greatest time to fish
yeah
oh yeah
oh yeah
it's well my dad got me hooked on it
and yeah oh god pun and we'd go out he liked to go out about five thirty and you know watch the sun come up every morning and boy we
we knew a bunch of the striper guides and so we'd follow them and he had a cb on the boat and all that kind of stuff and we'd just follow the channel and when it's you know
middle july through late august when it's so hot they stay down real deep all the big ones do yeah follow that channel on up
but so now my cousin will i make him get up early in the morning and take me out striper fishing and then we usually fish under the bridge at night with the kids and his wife and stuff like that because where we go a lot of times
the waves are so big i don't want my kids out there because it's sort of dangerous but i love it i love it
oh really
oh
oh how much fun
oh my goodness
uh-huh
oh my goodness
oh how much fun
uh-huh
oh my goodness
oh you're kidding ooh not for me
uh-huh
oh my gosh
ooh
uh-huh
yeah when i take the kids out like i say we in fact memorial day weekend we went up to the lake and
my cousins have a boat my boat is sitting in my driveway not running and so we go up there and we decided
that we'd you know go out we got everybody's tents up and camp made and all that and said come on let's go fishing we hauled in well we brought in
thirty three fish and we had thrown a bunch of little ones back
and so then we had a huge fish fry the next afternoon and we went back out fishing and we caught and brought in thirty three more and had thrown a bunch of the little ones back but we had more fun those kids
they've got real fishing poles but they're the little short ones
and it was so funny because i mean they'd just be hanging over the side of the boat mom i think i got a fish i think i got a fish oh it was hysterical but
jamie's getting to the age now that when i get up and go fishing early in the morning he wants to go too you know he doesn't want to get left behind anymore
so it's getting a little difficult to do that but
we love it we just love it
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i have to watch it because ashley'll out fish her brother half the time and so you know that gets a little sore
but where we camp there there's a you know little bit of a inlet where we park the boats and stuff so real early in the morning before it gets hot and then you know right at dusk
down in the trees down there boy all those little sunfish come up and they'll go down there while i'm cooking dinner and just start reeling those little babies in and they have more fun with that
oh usually i'll buy them a thing of worms or a lot of times i'll just give them a piece of bacon and they're they'll tear up bacon and stick it i mean those they'll bite empty hooks that's what's so funny
yeah it's great
but we just love it up there in fact jamie wanted to go up this weekend with it being fourth of july weekend but i can't put the tent up and all that kind of stuff quite yet i'm still pretty sore
so anyway but
have you been salt water fishing
oh my goodness
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
i i'd i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it
because i know
that
and
you're also under their liability under the workmen's comp
on my job we had a lot of workmen's comp cases and
i work for a tire company modern tire and it's also a retreading plant and that's where most of our injuries occur
and what we do is we'll have a drug test if an if a boy or a man has an accident then he's automatically given a drug trest
yes when he goes to the doctor the first time
and so that kind of i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have just started using it oh for the past year or so
now we've let some people go that well it was found that drugs were used in their system now i don't know how tec would handle it they haven't pursued it you know
if there's some problem i know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines
and he went to a separate drug testing firm and they showed it negative
so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know
uh-huh really
and then i also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine and he tested positive on cocaine now then you always wonder well is he just saying that you know
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah because you're endangering everybody's lives if you've if it's something like that
uh-huh
you're kidding
the executives
yeah wouldn't that be awful if you were
if you were using and oh lose your job and everything
i can't believe i'd was so
brazen before i'm like i say i'm a former drug user but i
well
i accepted christ as my lord and savior and so i don't use drugs any more
marijuana cocaine and amphetamines
yes
uh-huh
and all on the job too you know it had gotten that bad
really it's life is so much more enjoyable
uh-huh and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know
i mean you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing
uh-huh that's right
yeah
that's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh goodness
yeah
yeah
oh my gosh
yeah
uh-huh
right
well i would think they would be
but they weren't
isn't that awful
uh-huh
yeah
huh
yeah that's reminds me of i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff
let me move as far away as possible
yeah
but i'm proud though that you know i grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know but people have really wisened you know become wise about drugs and
they really have a good campaign for the young people you know they know it's not smart so
so i guess it was just a generational thing
um-hum
that's right and that's good that's the best way to stop it
yeah
okay
i can go ahead and start
in dallas there's definitely a crime problem i know it's you know worse in the larger cities it's kind of a concern for me in fact at the moment i'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and it's
i am single and female you definitely are going to worry about the location and
you know accessibility of people to be able to break in i live on a third floor now but i you know i'm real concerned that i don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that and
the
some buildings do it depends on the location the area i live in right now is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we don't have
anything at all no burglar alarms no guards some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum there's a lot of that going on in dallas too
it's really sad
um-hum
um-hum
oh i agree i think that people are getting off too easy they're getting they're getting paroled too easily they're just getting put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room so they get they get
they get lighter sentences and some of those people they don't deserve to be let loose
oh yeah
oh my gosh
um-hum
that's terrible but
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
right
it's a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right we have enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is so let their country take care of it we don't have i guess too much trouble in dallas with well i guess i guess we do have a lot of people come in from mexico
that cause problems but
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum it was amazing i went to the far east back in october to do some training for ti and i
some of those countries were so safe it was unreal singapore is very supposed to be very safe and in fact tokyo and i thought tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people
but they at the ti there i said is there any area i should avoid and the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl and said
can you think of any place where dana shouldn't go by herself or anything and she thought for a few minutes and she said no and he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself she said no
and they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
yeah that's true
that's true but i was thinking boy in dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night i'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out i mean
i couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place they said the apparently the crime is just
i'm not sure what it is there now i know what it is in singapore is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it like for drugs
for drugs they enforce the death penalty for that they're just very tough and i guess maybe that's the way tokyo is too or japan is too they're just very tough on criminals
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
right
they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
i agree because it's not fair to those of us that deserve a safe you know life to have to
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
right not much
yeah
hum-um and especially not in some of these big cities like in dallas i mean they've had they're up in the top five i think of cities that are getting policeman killed on in the line of duty and that's really sad
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
you own the company alright
my goodness
yeah i guess you do
hum
well what do you think of the let's put it this way what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than other than their present salary
um-hum
a profit sharing plan that's interesting um-hum
um-hum
and it's a contribution
well bill that idea fits me exactly i just retired from the university here and that's been the goal of my life was to
contribute and to the work that i was doing in my research and that's what made me happy
and that's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for and i'm sure a lot of them don't you can't stand in front of a counter and
do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth
you're a financial planning firm how many
uh-huh
um-hum oh
well what changes would you have you considered in doing it to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better
when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to come in and ask for your support
oh okay um-hum even though they didn't bring it in they help it once it's there
yeah
um-hum
yes but it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job but it might be whether the locality there those people want that kind of support
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
that's true
um-hum
i'm actually at work
i'm in facilities and happen to have weekend duty here
i'm in the south building
we pull mostly evenings we are having there's three of us facilities managers are covering the off shifts
just to have somebody here from management to
see if they need anything
oh the how many calls have you made
okay i'm getting close to twenty this is the
yeah hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one but i don't really have a lot in this one usually i can talk for hours on most of the subjects they pick go ahead you first
okay good
oh yeah
right
yeah i the worst one i guess is like you when it's a recording i don't mind so much someone calls and it's
and it's a salesperson at least you can chat or whatever and say okay now we want to go and then when they actually start off with a computer and expect you to talk to a computer that's where i draw the line i just hang up immediately you know
shut my other radio off here
i guess they get their name i'm amazed the i question about that
my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine and i have one too and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long
if they catch your answering machine
yeah they have they can erase all your others you know because if you have
i think that's the way it is no mine i guess if it's full it will not take it i'm not sure but they can certainly
block your answering machine so someone else calls you and your answering machine is full you know it won't erase
but your right that was a good one
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i've got one it's not really an invasion of privacy but it's annoyance for me in the office with speaker phones you know i they're great for an office but this one guy next to me who's not here just so i could talk about him
he uses his speaker phone all the time and it carries over and so not only would you hear it seems to me that you talk longer for one you kind of yell into it
and so he yells into it and you hear the other person too so it's kind of a double annoyance he actually ruins my privacy you might say because the ti offices are so open anyway
that i'm amazed that in fact i'm about ready to say something if he's even thought of that that's a real
uncourteous thing an invasion of everyone else's time and concentration to just be loud i don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and
and annoying you know that's perhaps not quite an invasion of privacy but i think it is and we both picked phone items there
go ahead do you have any more
oh yeah that's a good one too yeah i heard something about not that exactly but go ahead
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i heard something similar to that i listen to i'm a
a talk show person
and other words when i when i do my chores i put the i'm a radio person i guess is what i mean and so i listened to was it five seventy which has continuous talk on the weekends
and neil sperry and everybody i mean the lawyers and veterinarians and all that and i don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a financial application
all that information on there is really not necessarily even a your social security number you know they you should just put down the basics and put n a where you don't want to answer
whether it's your personal salary or whatever if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down
and i was curious as to you know what specific things you did have to put down but he says social security you don't need to put that down there which i thought was surprising so maybe there's something along that same line where you know in all these
financial applications that you make out you don't have to put all that stuff down there it would be nice to know what's what was
of course of course they could say well i can't give you a card and you could say fine but you know some things will be private you know but he said just put n a and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your
money anyway they want your card
but if you don't feel like putting it down just put n a you know
yeah
yeah
i haven't i don't have any friends down at the austin plant but i heard that they were really upset about the drug thing and we seem to up here have just breezed through that and apparently some other companies are having trouble that i don't have any trouble with it
it's kind of unusual here we are in dallas you know
the biggest location and it just breezed through and wasn't really no one was i guess was really too concerned about it
yet in austin there were whether it was a class action or how far it got i don't really know because ti
only had a few things on ti news i think about it that they were objecting to but some people object to that which i don't mind
problem at all you know
hum
yeah right
right
i know
i know yeah i served my time too yeah
yeah
oh they object too
um-hum
yeah well i'm all for it i
it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or you know carry it to wherever you want to carry it really
of course that would really be a big thing in a public school but i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it
and i think it is they found that it's been very low really
i guess maybe at the locations though i don't know if they have it done but done it by location i don't really know if they need to publish that really
right
right
right
but i think that was an actually a good thing that happened i never considered it i guess it's an invasion of your privacy but it's something that is for the good of so many people you know to have everyone take the test randomly and
and hopefully maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that well i might as well get off you know if i want to stay so you know if that was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good
oh sure
right
um-hum
right
go ahead you got me more i this is this is a tough one i don't really haven't thought about any of this they had gardening yesterday and auto repairs and boy i could
it's on the time that we spend with our children
okay
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
we just well we have the one that has left
but he was here a year ago and he was involved in wrestling and along with my three older sons we had six children and our oldest son our second son is
he's a doctor and he was all state in wrestling
and then my last son that just left home is all state in wrestling so we had two in our family but we had a lot of participation with them and i know what you're talking about where you it's difficult to find time but i
i feel it's very important that you support the kids as much as you can you and the spouse because when well both sons when they were wrestling they would kind of look up
to see if we were in the audience and the that's the last they pay any attention to us -til after the game is over right and the wrestling match
and we really enjoyed it to be involved with our children and i think it's very important that's something that
the parents today and there is so much involvement that it gets pretty difficult but i think with church and everything else that you're doing
but that's where a family relationship is really built and it's then they have
um-hum
uh-huh
well super
well those are things that they'll never forget and they know they're loved when that takes place
and that you're supporting them there are so many families that i know about today that they just don't take time to do anything with their children
oh good well we're gonna try to get down to hopefully for his the oldest one's
baptism and then the grandson's our youngest to get his to the blessing but i don't know whether we can make it or not we're gonna give it a shot but that's coming up
i appreciate that he was a super son and when he was wrestling we had two sons wrestling and we one week we went to twelve wrestling matches in one week
we had one the oldest his older brother was in college and he was in high school and we could get to all of those but
so anyway
um-hum well that's super
oh i see okay
i've this the first call so i don't know what happens when the time's up
oh i see okay fine
and course church involvement i think is very important too that with parents supporting their children in taking them to church and going with them
and that's another activity that time is spent and
so how do you feel about our policy in latin america
yeah do you think that's do you think that's right
do you think we should direct the government
yeah
yeah well i have a friend that's his descendants are from
he you know i just as far as feelings
for people that
their family came from there and how they feel about you know our intervention and their governments and stuff like that and he was all for it because it's just like you say there's so many people there that
that get the kind of control that's bad you know and that their governments can become so corrupt and it's like well you know i use to feel like
well they should work their way they you know they should be able to work their self out of it or you know why intervene in another country's you know problems and things like that why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that
but
i think just a lot of times if we don't then it then that influence will affect our country too for one and for two
you know that it does help i mean you know i think the people in those countries do want our help the people that are know under conditions that are you know not favorable to this their rights
so
but
i wish we didn't have to i mean i'd rather even if a country chooses a government that's not you know exactly the kind of government that we have you know or is in complete
opposition to it at least it's their choice as long as long it's one that's
that makes sense so to speak you know this is a government that stays in power that can stay in power but it seems like most of them don't
you know
oh yeah
so you think like cia influence and our money over there
or government aids and stuff
well then how can you how can you say as far as like in europe as far as the toppling of those kinds of governments
you know like
i mean
yeah
but we don't we're not intervening in that or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing
yeah
see i agree with that yeah
i agree that the communication that now that communication has become
so much more widespread and you know worldwide that people are realizing hey we don't have it so good and let's stand up
for you know this is ridiculous we're living with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is that i think people are just saying no way we don't want any more of this
yeah
yeah well i mean
i don't mean to well i guess i do in a way sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that i think that because of those countries a lot you know where such catholic influence and i think the catholic religion itself
was such a dominant factor as far as keeping the people down
so to speak
but see but i don't agree with that because the catholic religion as far as through the ages has been the rule so to speak
you know they are the ones that set the set a lot of the rules and they are the ones that do keep the people down i mean when you have a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're
yet they're expected to bow down to it i think that keeps people in a sort of line you know
well when it use to be latin i'm just saying that
the old church
yeah which it's not that way now but i think that there is just that i think that it's just latin countries are slower in coming around
well latin
they still didn't understand it though i don't think
because i descend from that and i you know i don't can't i don't understand latin
i just think that has something to do with why latinos are tend to be
you know the more meek you know they tend to be more
not stand up for their rights as much they're not really sure of what they are
i don't think
well i mean how can you contrast the europeans and their vocalism on their rights to say the people in latin america i mean why are they
why are they not as vocal or why do they not you know stand up so to speak for their rights
um-hum
i don't agree with that i don't agree because i think that they are pretty vocal about it
in africa
i think they've made a lot more changes
hey they've their very vocal
so what's the difference
yeah
so what makes the difference between say south america and the rest of i mean south africa and it is rest of africa
yeah
yeah
i think it maybe has to do with a lot a lot to do with education because you look at the european countries
i think they are they do tend to be more educated much more educated than
than africa or the latin american countries
um-hum well i know that russia they're comparably more better educated than we are in our country
yeah
yeah
in our country
yeah
yeah well that's just it though good education
is it good education it may be free but is it good education and that's just it are we willing to pay for it you know
i mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all but are so are they willing to pay for you know
quality education you know
so you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the japanese moving in and the russians moving in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate and it's like well you know
they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do so you're going to have to expect it so what you are you willing are you willing to compromise a little and pay some take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education
and it just seems like you can decorate a table and you can serve easily with eight people particularly if you're wanting to do the soup to nuts thing which with my
dishes i have a really pretty soup tureen so i like to start out with you know some kind of soup that nobody's had lately like sauerkraut soup or minestrone depending upon what the menu theme is
but one thing that i like to do
of course i always want to make it easy on the cook and the lady who is the manager of the country club gave me a really good recipe for ham loaf that it's something you can make up ahead and then stick in the oven you know
after your guests are here and you've started cocktails really
usually our friends the women are the bridge players and the men are there because it's an excuse to get together
but i do find that in order to have your party last beyond
the dinner table there does have to be something to go on to or you just kind of sit around and everybody goes to sleep and gets bored you know there's got to be a silly game or a
something fun to do afterwards
um-hum
you have more summer than we do though
yeah we can do that well starting the end of this well starting now we can do that through october
but that's about it for us and then we're basically inside you know even if it's really warm during the day at night it's going to cool off and by the time you would get ready to eat you're going to want to be in
so our climate is not as conducive to the outdoor entertaining as yours are although it's certainly a lot more casual and a lot more fun
yeah
yeah and i think outside you can just kind of kick back and visit after dinner but is seems like when you're inside the first thing you know someone has turned on a tv and that kind of is the end of your party i think
what do you do for a barbecue when you cook out what's your favorite thing
yeah
oh i see you're even labeled by your food how do you do fajitas
eight ounce
um-hum
i've i love mexican and i'm always doing the hot things and i make my own salsa and all that and it's really spicy but i just haven't had the nerve to try fajitas how large a steak would you need to serve eight people
so i'd need two pounds wouldn't i one pound four people
and then is that a fairly thick steak or
oh
uh-huh so when you when you get it you don't have your meat man cut it to a certain width you just take whatever you find okay flank or skirt
okay a sixteen ounce can of beer and then you mix eight ounces of italian dressing with it do you let the beer get flat or
um-hum
you know something i do when i marinate steak that you might think is interesting i have a tupperware sealed or any plastic sealed and then i just turn it over every once in awhile
and it saves you know it's just easy just to turn the whole dish over the whole container over
okay yeah so you do grated cheese and guacamole
okay
uh-huh okay
where did i write the part about the tortillas warm the tortillas
yeah
okay
i see
uh-huh i'm sure you'd probably i mean the men would eat two and the women would eat one isn't that usually how that goes
uh-huh
well we have our children all three live here and our two married daughters have three children between them who range from eight to three and
every time they and they always come here for every holiday it seems and birthdays and every time we always have to start up with something really hot and spicy as an hors d'oeuvres and it gets to be
both our son sons-in-law are good cooks and enjoy cooking and it kind of gets to be a contest to see who can come up with the
well we're way up the other end of the state we're half way between chicago and indianapolis on i sixty five so and terre haute is you know it's like three hours south
um-hum
yeah this is a little town of five thousand just a perfect little town for us retired people and for raising children and
-ay as i understand it is
less than half of all eligible voters participate in national elections
and less than that in local elections and do you think that's a problem and do you have any or do we can we can come up with any solutions for that so if you're ready we'll start
i participate in all of the national you know elections and the state elections that you know that affect me
i'm sometimes not too good in local elections i do i do vote you know in bond matters and things like that but i don't i no longer have children in school so school board elections you know doesn't really
but i do try to i don't just vote to be voting you know i try to have you know educate myself a little bit you know on the on the issues rather than just voting blindly you know
um-hum
right
um-hum
that's true
um-hum
yeah i do too
yeah right uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah that's true
that's true
less than half i was kind of surprised to hear that
yeah i thought it would have been higher than that
do you ever or have you ever do you ever actively work for a candidate
in working in his campaign it's really interesting to do it's hard work but it it's interesting to do
but i haven't done any of it done any of it lately
uh-huh
right uh-huh yeah uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
it really is yeah
yeah it
yeah it's interesting to do
yeah
we did mailings put up signs you know and things like that
went to a few dinners things like it was interesting it really was of course it was all volunteer we weren't paid members
it was interesting to do
i don't know maybe it maybe it should be stressed through you know public education in schools you know or something i don't know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah some sort of educational process i'm not quite sure what
that's true yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i don't know either it's kind of a tough question
something to generate interest i don't know quite what
i really don't know
i don't know
maybe so
yeah right
take care bye-bye
okay do you do any woodworking
oh what do you do for a hobby or for
um-hum
um-hum
well i'm not the one that cuts them out my husband cuts them out but
he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw because the stroll saw is
is a lot slower
and then he's got a router but now he wants a plunge router
but anyhow he cuts them out and then i took a tole painting class
to learn how to paint them right you know
and what we wanna do is you know make them and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and see if we can sell some of them
but i really like it so far
and then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood so i took a pattern off of that
and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face and then you make the dress for it
and you drill holes around the top of the head and you stick in like rope
and tie ribbons around it looked really cute you know so i've got a couple of those started
yeah and then
but as far as wood work that's all we've been doing right now
um-hum
um-hum
what do you do i wonder how you just they buy them from you or you just give them to them on consignment or something
um-hum
um-hum
i see
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah these little things are so cute though you know
i went through some of the books down here at the craft shop you know and there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out in fact i just sent to shop smith
back in ohio for a rocking horse pattern
yeah well he's retired now and
i'm kind of semi retired my company went bankruptcy so i'm drawing my pension from them but i'm still looking for a part time job you know
but he has all day long that he can you know work on this stuff and
do cut outs like that you know
and he's got a lot a lot of tools so
it's just it's just getting started you know
but these little wooden things they seem to sell really good i know a lot of people that have gotten them you know
so i'm just hoping that you know that we can get some cut out and painted you know before summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time you know
but
it seems it seems like they go real good you know i mean the country anyhow out here and i live out in the valley and country seems to be the in thing out here
you know everybody wants little country pieces so anything that looks like it might be country is what they want you know yeah
and this little rabbit that i made in tole painting class
you know is like a welcome it's got a it's gonna have little wooden hearts holding it in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts
and
okay so what kind of cars are you looking at
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh okay
uh-huh
right that's a real good deal in fact my dad recently got a
and he got a demo and it's been a real good car and it's like new and it only had very low mileage on it
and so he i think he got a real good deal of course they're fully loaded usually and so it's a i think it's a pretty good option
uh-huh
um-hum
and then the cadillac is definitely a used car or uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
right that's what i'm thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because my last two cars are brand new or do i want to look for a used car that's maybe two three years old that's in you know low mileage and in good shape
but i just i kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it is it a lemon or is something wrong with it but i guess that's a risk you have to take
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum about how much do they charge to do something like that do you know
yeah that's not bad
yeah well it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago and i yes i don't want to think about buying a car for a while i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and
and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and you know hang on to the one i've got for a few years because it's almost four years old but it's still in great shape i have a mazda rx7
um-hum
yeah i just about could really because i think my car if i continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value and that if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldn't have too much trouble at all
but i really i really enjoy the car i have now and i do want to hold onto it and you know enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems in fact it never has and
it's been kind of nice and i surprisingly enough after four years i'm not tired of the car at all and
um-hum
wow
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum yeah
right what kind of car is it
um-hum are you going to trade it in on this new one or
okay
uh-huh
um-hum
so she's going to sell it rather than trade it in that's probably the best thing
or maybe more than that as i've learned yeah when i bought my rx7 i best offer i got for my other car was twenty five hundred well i turned around and sold it myself for forty two hundred so
you can do much better i'm glad you're taking care of it yourself i think trading it in they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in
that's what i think so
but strangely enough the best i mean the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price
prices plus i was going through the that ti fleet discount program
well it's before they had that
i had gone over to texins and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program and what you could expect they said you know a five percent
over cost and then options at cost and everything so i figured out a price based on that
but i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the town north mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was gonna be able to get it for in arlington
and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the and the cruise control he said you're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage and they just laughed at me
and i went the next morning to arlington and they gave it to me for that price and what's so funny is they took the car they i knew they were gonna pull it from town north because that's where the white one was and they had already told me we located one at town north so it was that same car
oh i did and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup and
that they required you to do and i took it to town north and sure enough i saw that guy and he recognized me he said oh hi dana and he kind of looked down and saw that car and i'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when the place in arlington
went and took the car because i told him there's a place in arlington that's gonna give it to me for that price he said no they're not and the next day they
is kind of nice but
yeah good talking to you too don
okay good luck in your car hunting uh-huh bye-bye
see in the newspaper or on the news when president bush fainted at a dinner it was that in japan
well i thought it was pretty scary i missed it i mean i when they were rerunning it like the next day or something mean i didn't hear about it on the day it happened but i
it was interesting you know that when he fainted and every one kind of jumped up on the table and surrounded him and it's really amazing that would happen and then of course all the dan quayle discussion comes up again
um-hum
right
it is scary
yes
uh-huh
right they're foreign students
um-hum
um-hum
well they seem
well that's really true and but i have noticed from my associations with teenagers in high school that they are really motivated by how much money they can make and when they hear on the news about people being laid off
and you know corporations and things i mean i feel like they don't wanna make the effort out of their own personal interests to follow a particular field or they wanna think you know how quickly can they make money
and they're not attracted by the work that has to be done to achieve
you know a position like that
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
well you're right when you say that
the important issues need to be not so as much what's going on other places i mean that it's important for us to do
i mean we can't be isolated here but you know we do need to pay more attention to our own economy and
and our own civilization because we've seen how quickly and it's almost unbelievable the fall of the soviet union and the berlin wall and all of that's almost unreal to me still
so how you how do you find out what's going on
uh-huh
do you listen to the same station or do you switch back and forth
uh-huh i listen to i actually i listen to the radio most of all i don't i don't buy papers and stuff i listen a lot to national public radio
which is i know pretty much it's got in the morning it has like an all news format
and then toward it changes like it goes onto classical then onto jazz later on but on in the way to work that's what i do is i listen to npr and what it says about what's going on
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
jack do you listen i don't know do i like it when i watch i don't really watch tv news all that often but what i do is i like abc i think i think they have the best news network
have you ever watched nightline with ted coppell or is that i get to see that i get that occasionally but it's like i he's a i think he's sort of like an upscale geraldo
uh-huh
dentist office material
i actually i kind of gave up on news magazines they haven't they kind of end up piling up
yeah it
oh well i tried like i like i read the sunday paper you know i that one i can i can find time for you know like on a i really like to on a sunday morning get up and listen get up
and read the sunday paper like usually i try to read it from like from cover to cover you know
and that pretty much gives you gives me an idea what's going on and in about like a two hours it takes me to run right through it i can figure out exactly what what's happened in like the past week
but that's about the only newspaper that i really listen to
so you end well you end up with like a big stack of papers anyway on the on the way out huh
well one of the things that i can't do is i just can't find the time to read the paper all that much it just
to find the time to read the paper
and that's why i like the radio the best especially in the car because i when i'm in the car and i'm on my way to work there's nothing else i can do other than like watch the road you know
oh and it its it slides in a window across the bottom
um-hum
so do you is it is it dow jones
friends of mine at friends of mine at other at other at other locations they have that and it's like you can actually see like the ticker run you know you can open a window on your work station
and so you can see you can see the you can
okay
do you want to start
do you have a
um-hum
um-hum
so you never let it run up on you
that is wonderful that is wonderful i'm i kind of
i'm just do you know just all depends that it when i have everything all paid off and then i start wanting something and i don't really have enough well don't have enough in savings you know like for a big purchase
then sometimes i lose sight of it you know it's it is just is easy to use
and then after a while i am like you i hate paying those people interest and then i
i make i added like wrote an addition to my car loan through the credit union which i knew was lower interest just to pay them all off and then i swore i would never use them again
um-hum
the only thing is you have to make sure that you don't charge more than you know you are going to be able to pay
at a given time and
yeah and the problem is especially with young people is they want things now they don't want to have to wait for them and credit cards are the way to do that
and then they're in trouble
um-hum
i have a i have a friend who
well she is old enough to know better but she did it and she got really in bad shape she ended up going into bankruptcy
and palley royal is her downfall and there is no limit on those things
they just let you come and spend and you know run it up run it up so i don't know
palley royal
uh-huh
i do not know if i don't know if it is local
no palley royal
i know i know a lot of people who some ladies at work who don't have any problems with money or anything but they really love palley royal
so you know they it is just you know you got stay away or else you might end up you just can't help yourself and buy
self-control is the key my daughter has my daughter is twenty and she got a sears credit card when she was about eighteen
and christmas before last she and her boyfriend her boyfriend had gotten one too i believe
and they gave some of the most wonderful gifts to everyone in their family i mean they spent lots of money on they gave each other these beautiful things they gave stuff to all of us and we were going
i can't believe you all did this you should not have done this and they got angry and said
we wanted to do it
okay she is still paying on that sears charge she has now you know she's learned and she is definitely paying it off paying on it and not running it back up but you can't tell them
that's right
um-hum
the only good one good thing about credit cards though especially in business if you
you have to
you know you are going to be reimbursed by your company
and then in fact i know of a man who is in
he is in a he is in an oil pipe
pipe line selling kind of a thing and he has to
he has to live on credit cards and then he gets commission you know later on but if he did not have credit cards he could not exist because a lot of those you know because he knows
six weeks down the road he is probably you know he is going to get the money to pay for it but he really does so sometimes i think
um-hum
that's true
oh yeah
yeah
um-hum that is true
that's really true
right you know like emergencies or something that you do not have the ready that you do not have cash and you have to
your car breaks down or you have to you have to have something
it's a real it's you know you do not have the money in savings so it really is a lifesaver at times when you do have to use it but
but like you say use it wisely
only in you know when you really have to or knowing that you are going to pay it off every month
so that is that is something about american express if you only use american express you do not have a choice
you're kidding
and they were knowing they were going to go into bankruptcy
so they it was planned
oh no right
yeah
yeah me too really
well i guess we covered it
do you have any do you have anything else you want to add
well if you have got any other thoughts
throw them out
well thank you catherine bye
uh-huh i think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system as far as people dropping out of school
grades on test scores being low more and more people taking geds trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school you know something must be wrong as far as
not just the teaching techniques but just motivation
within the schools themselves
um-hum
oh it's okay
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
right and i know i work around you know a lot of teachers and i understand how
supportive they are of their students and how excited they are but some how i don't think the students are getting excited
oh yes definitely um-hum
um-hum
right
right
uh-huh
progress um-hum
yeah not even that much probably yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
and speaking and speaking of doing what you want just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety one a lot of the teenagers and young people
have a lot more freedom as far as what they do as far as you know even something as simple as staying up late
watching television late going out late start dating you start dating too early you know just little things like that do start in the home
that can that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day or more in school
and so any other part of your life that's going to definitely affect your school life because you spend so much time there
uh-huh
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
i talked to a guy the other day and he is now in a program that's trying to get him out of high school
because he fell back several years ago and he's going to he will have gone to school five years
and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died
and he was having to support his entire family take care of his brothers and sisters you know and all that had an adverse affect on his school life
and yeah and that and that's a perfect example of how your home life you know plays a definite part
and you know any other aspect of your life an but now that he's in this program and you know he's i guess okay he's making straight a's
and you know it just it was there it was just
i guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time
uh-huh
um-hum
right
exactly
um-hum
exactly
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
when people start talking about programs that help for me i don't care if it's socialist or i don't care
as long as it's something that's going to do some good or that looks like it could be beneficial i mean that's the point i'm at now
i mean that's the point we all should be at if you like finding some solution i mean you know nothing totally radical but if it's something that
you know might help you know because there's not a lot being done
um-hum
right
um-hum
take them out yeah
hm not very far at all
um-hum
um-hum i mean it's almost like
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
and a lot of the
a lot of the parents now are so young you know that they're still they still don't know what's going on and how are they supposed to
you know teach their kids that are coming up you know what's going on i mean it's just it's a vicious cycle
that we're you know dead smack dead in the center of and we have to try to swim out you know kind of like the bermuda triangle we're just sinking and it's almost impossible to swim back up
but yeah there's definitely problems it's just the solutions that you know they're going to be in our political system they're going to be on everyone's minds for quite a while too long
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
yeah there's
right
there's definitely too much leeway as far as i mean i've only been out of i've been out of college only two years and
you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out and i already you know i really didn't i really don't see myself going back to school or anything but i appreciate more what i had
and i had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm and i just didn't take as much advantage of it as i should have and
no i went to ut at austin uh-huh so i mean all kinds of resources and you know just there
and i'd give anything to have that right now in my in my regular i mean you have everything given to you i don't see why
people wouldn't want that i don't know i but then if i was young i wouldn't see it but you know now that it's gone i
right
um-hum
um-hum
right
yeah i did a lot and i experienced a lot and i feel like i got a good college education but just when i got out i feel like i should have spent more time in the library i should have
taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were you know the informal classes that you don't get credit for you know
recently set up some relief for the guy that's been up orbiting the mirror space station for the last ten months
boy i would think so that's incredible but could you imagine being in a in such an enclosed area for such a long period of time and totally isolated
no i don't think so either i was also kind of surprised that i don't maybe there were technical limitations on what could be done but it seemed like a perfect opportunity for the united states space program to
at least offer to get involved with them in send up some sort of a relief or supplies or something and
get some sort of a union going
yeah i hope so i'd like to see something like that
right how do you feel as far as spending the tremendous amounts of money that need to be spent to keep the program going how do you feel about
right yeah it really is it's
i'd certainly hate to see anything come to a grinding halt
although i guess certain logic could be applied to figure out how much spending it can do in any given year or period of years
but i'd like to see you hear talk about this future space station that may be built may serve as a intermediate point between like a trip to mars or something like that and
seems like the next big step that needs to be taken is interplanetary travel but that also seems so
i don't know like the thing that some the figment of somebody's imagination
oh
oh is that right
oh really
i would think so i'd certainly think so and then you have the unfortunate mix between military politics and scientific exploration that
they're starting up star wars again evidently and that gets i don't i think a lot of people lump that into the category of space travel even though it really has nothing to do with
scientific quest for knowledge it's
preventative thing for the military
definitely in fact it seems that a lot of those benefits were unexpected as far as
they had plans for these things and they sent them up years and years ago and they never expected them to be still transmitting data back
that's incredible some of the pictures that have come back
yeah i agree i think that's definitely been worth while and like you said it's very cost effective and
probably yields as much information as having somebody actually up there
yeah i think so
i don't think it's glamorous i probably wouldn't enjoy it
all the time while it was happening but boy could you imagine looking back
okay what do you think is the biggest problem
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
is it the do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home
right
yeah i think that the biggest problem is with the with the home environment being part of it you know if
i think too many parents expect the school to teach the moral aspects of things to the to the kids and you know while we're not going to worry about
teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then
expect them to pick it up at school and you're not going to do that you know you're going to carry with carry to school out into the world you know what you learned at home and
i think that part of that's
showing up now you know with things because kids
i think have probably less respect than for people than in other things than
than we may have seen in the past
and part of it's the family i think and part of it's
the living conditions of certain people are subjected too drugs is a big problem now and i think that's another root problem
uh-huh
right
well i think it's like you say it's the socioeconomic mix there you know the they're the you look at the if the if the
the schools like that where you got a lot of kids who are basically
that might be more well to well off you know going to a private catholic school or whatever and they're not all that way but you know some that are
that they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city you know public schools
yeah
well you know in a lot of cases like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving them
an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some desire for the kid to do well you know and that may be
now passed on down to the kid as well and maybe they pick up on that
then and then from the other aspect maybe the school itself is has more emphasis on
trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller they may be able to give the resources that's needed to do a good job
that's a tough question how to fix the school system with i would try to
more
more classes that i think that are and i think this is happening some around the country in terms of morals trying to teach the kinds of things that aren't getting taught at home and
and respect for other people
i think that's a big part of it you know people you know if you don't care about property and people you know
you're not going to care about
about learning i think
you know you're not going to really care about yourself
right
uh-huh
well you know and i that's not an but that's not an easy task you know that's why i say it's a tough question what would you do because you know even
trying to instill those values is kind of hard when you're growing up in you know in a home which may be just the pits and
you don't have any kind of a good environment to live in you know it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of other people's stuff as well when you're when you
you barely have anything yourself so i could see where that would be a problem and i think that's i think it's there are
well how do you feel about the immigration laws
yeah well i'm not real sure why i got this topic because i don't think i checked it off on the list because i know very little about the current immigration laws
uh-huh
hum
no that doesn't make a whole of lot sense
um-hum
yeah
and have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years
several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family they were all they were all born here
so i don't have any real strong ties with any with the immigration laws i don't because i don't
i don't have any personal feelings about them and i haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i
not only would the united states become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly
i think it would bring in a lot of people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in other countries i think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their brand of crime
i was not aware of that
uh-huh
yeah
well i've enjoyed talking to you
bye-bye
what kind of car would you like to buy next
huh why would that be a
okay well that's good if you had no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy
say what
which type of cadillac is your favorite
the seville that's a sharp looking car that really is it always has been though
you know it doesn't have the coup de ville or the sedan de ville squareness it never really has it's always had it's own unique look
yeah i've always liked that i liked the one year they had or the couple years they had were
the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it
i thought now that looks sharp that looks real sharp
um-hum
yeah and the i i've never really i've never ridden in one recently but they're supposed to be just real smooth
just a nice comfortable ride
uh-huh
right now they've got a unique feature in them now if you have a front end accident
at such a rate of speed the engine will actually drop
out of the car so that it doesn't come through the
so it does not go it doesn't go through the you know into the inside it'll go underneath the car instead
so that's a big safety factor they've got in them now
the air bags yep
so though that's great that's great so you say you've always preferred general motors products what
right
what kind of
oldsmobiles those are real nice riding cars too
has that been the cutlass or the sierra
the ninety eight okay
well i don't think
let's see the ninety eight now that's got that big v eight engine in it doesn't it doesn't it
has a little v six
okay
it
oh that's great that's great that's always nice to get reliability
in a product especially when you're spending you know anywhere from fifteen to twenty five thousand dollars for a single item
you know you just don't want any hassles with it you just you expect it to do its job and i think a lot of
a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into don't take that into consideration you know
they just expect you to buy their product but
that's always been something that's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car gonna be you know price is an issue but it's not the most important issue
right
well i've always been a ford man myself
yes but that's all right you know it's american made too which is good but i i've ever since i guess i was growing up my dad's always had fords
and well i grew up in south dakota so everybody has a truck
and my ford trucks have just i've just never had problems with them i honestly think i would die before my truck would kill over on me
so
hi my last
auto repair
was my alternator went out i have a nineteen eighty six toyota
it's a little tercel
and i have a friend whose real good with repairing cars
so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and
you know get a replacement part
we went to a
a place called quality auto parts an and their parts are
supposed to be guaranteed and everything and they're
they're very reasonable so i bought the alternator we put it on the car
and it didn't work and it blew out all the fuses
yeah
i something like sixty nine dollars something on that order
no he hooked it up right
it was just that the part
just didn't fit the car so
i took it back and he took the guy in the parts shop took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them
and he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we went back and tried it again
put it on again and it still didn't work
and we took the car up to a little place called pep boys i don't know if you have them in your area
but they're
they're pretty reasonable car repair place also
so took it up there
towed it up there because it you know wouldn't start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses
and took them about an hour
to figure out what was what was blowing the fuse and it was it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse anyway
ended up taking it to the toyota dealer and the only problem was that it had to be a genuine toyota alternator
because most of the other ones that they say will fit it
that you know they sit in there and everything but there's just some little difference that
causes it not to work
yeah i guess so and that was my that was my last experience
uh-huh
uh-huh goodness
are you able
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well my car is it's an eighty six and i really hadn't had any trouble with it until that and the car now has a hundred and thirty something
thousand miles on it and
and this was just recent
so i really can't complain about this one
well i used
i used to work it was a seventy mile trip everyday
you know two ways was seventy miles
no it was it was just seventy miles yeah
and i did that for about three years and it really it really added up
i've only taken
maybe two trips that were about four hours long
down to shreveport
and the rest of it was you know it's just basically driving a long ways to work
and now i drive like twenty three miles each way
so
i'm getting a little a little relief but still i drive a long ways
but i guess because they're highway miles
you know it's not so bad on your car as
as if it you know were just
regular street
you know
yes i do
do you
points
there's a number that you call it's the same number that you that you call to make a call
you call that number and
somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message and you can leave a message
i know someone that did that you leave a message and they'll call you back
oh really
uh-huh
well i don't know if i've done it quite that much but
mine is mixed up too i have to call and get it fixed
let's see before i had this car i had a
i bought an audi five thousand
but i bought it i bought it used
i just bought it from a friend who was going to who just charged me what the dealer was going to give him for it for a trade-in
and
it had a whole lot of miles on it i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it an i an i did get a couple of good years
out of it and the
the engine messed up on me
and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the for the audi dealer
and he took the engine apart and
you know he just said he couldn't fix it so the engine never got put back together again
i
wow
i think those old cars
might be a pretty good bet because you
i don't know
uh-huh
uh-huh
i read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy four
uh-huh
yeah
yeah it's easy to
it's easy i guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions
and if you i guess if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time
course i guess i could do the same thing with the toyota that i have
yeah
i guess so but i just think they cost too much in the in the first place
now a days
say you did starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one
yeah
she had to label everything what was she driving
uh-huh
yeah
yeah did you replace just the bendix on the chrysler station wagon or the whole starter
yeah the starters are kind of fragile
especially if you need a tune up
yeah well if they start real easy you know you just hit the key and it starts up and when it's properly tuned up that starter will last for a long time
see they built that starter so it'd fit every v-8 and all the slant sixes
that they built in like thirty five years
they all take the exact same starter they'll interchange completely i mean completely one starter will fit all of them
so they've got a whole lot of torque but to do that did they use an underdrive system where they geared it down
so its motor spins really fast
so it's got to spin for very long it's kind of tough on the bushings usually what goes is the bushings you take a little time replace the bushings you still got a perfectly good starter
but most places don't put don't rebuild them with good enough bushings so it's you know
after you get rebuilt one you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly especially if you need a tune-up
anyway what are you driving now
that's good
what is it a late model set chrysler van
yeah
one of the little minivans
do you like the way it rides and such
rides rough
yeah
yeah
but
they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years too
see i've driven one i drove a volkswagen beetle for a while about a month in that month i think i put three oil coolers on it
every time i turned around i was having trouble with it everything else i ever owned was american built
mostly older cars i've been a mechanic well i worked starting working my father's service station when i was about
twelve
so i've been around cars a lot
but driven a lot of old pontiacs
my first three cars were seventy model pontiacs a gto and a bonneville and a station wagon and
i had a couple of chryslers had a super b for a while with a four forty in it
it a lot of fun
but
i don't know gas mileage wasn't too bad i got about seventeen
well till you got crazy with it you know you get the four barrel all worked up and suddenly it drops off fast but
didn't have to work very hard to move the car around
oh yeah definitely
you know the my last gm car was a seventy chevy station wagon
it still had the points and condenser in it
when i rebuilt the engine on that about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car
i pulled that old points distributor out and got a an hei distributor electronic distributor and put into it
i've changed wiper blades or something but i have noticed since i got married that my husband
he hates to do auto repairs but he would rather do them himself than to pay someone else i guess he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows he knows how to do it
and to do it so he hates the time that he takes but he has changed
and so he priced around and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars which he did and then
he did it and i so i guess he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up what what's your experience been like
um-hum
right
um-hum
huh yes
um-hum
yes i'm sure it was
um-hum
right
yeah well that's exactly the way he feels is that
generally i think he does not look forward to or anticipate there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars there's a lot of people and he just isn't one of them
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
right
no
um-hum
right you know that it's really has a bad reputation is to feel that people in general feel and have rightly so i think been cheated many times and
and well i know once when we had a we usually round inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car but once the muffler needed to be changed and
he had looked at it himself and but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change he said that's really good so he went in and but when
they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something anyway but the car that the muffler people had my at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler
further you know they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever and so since then i don't think he's ever even seriously considered a you know any kind of job he thought he could do himself
but i know from his childhood he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment i guess and so kelly growing up he
he felt like that was a good way on saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father
and so he used they used car repairs kind of as a way to have you know something that they did together
and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand and be functional now and it helped him to have a close relationship so
that's one way he looked at it
um-hum
um-hum
yeah it didn't always work well i felt i feel like i could myself do some things
but that i have enough responsibility that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home and my husband
that's willing to do it i go ahead and let them do it i don't feel the need to
you know be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things i'm happy to let them run the cars because i have so many other responsibilities that
so i haven't tried to do a lot myself
um-hum
uh-huh
hum
it's a good experience it helps you feel i think comfortable with your car and feel like it's
not so scary if you're driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might you think well i've been under that hood and i know what's going on but
um-hum
um-hum
so the general topic is hobbies let's hear about your hobbies
any handicrafts any handicrafts
so i think i'm developing a new handicraft i think it'll become resume writing
yeah i hate to think about it and i'm getting rather good at reading want ads yeah it
no all means about fifteen to twenty percent of
of oh i'm sure the numbers somewhat classified but it's on the internal news and the news services so it's approximately six fifty so
ten percent of six fifty sixty five and twenty percent would be one thirty
yeah that's possible
i saw 7-eleven that was hiring
yes
yeah no apple's coming to town and that has some opportunities and
colorado springs specifically yes
and mci's coming if telemarketing is your bag personally i'd rather die a slow painful death but
i'm a defense worker a government tool control specialist
are you still employed
oh
exempt or hourly oh yes
oh so you didn't even get the severance package
so are you happy with what you're doing now
yeah
significantly shaken by the situation
but not devastated
tell you the truth i'm not really worried
and i seem rather happy about it most of the time just to know
what's
possibilities are you know what might happen
but
still in all
it feels funny
so
despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or going for walks in the mountains i can't seem to get into it right now
situational i doubt i'll be here in six months
all things being equal yes
but or even somewhere better but
god this is much better than west texas
but then they tell me hell is much better than west texas
i my little brother lives in austin right now
goes to ut
i
and just kind of go with the punches
and now i feel lost
oh i've had job offers
but
and that
oh so had you been with ti long when you changed huh
well there's a noticeable difference there i've been with them sixteen
actually seventeen now and
oh yeah momentum is driving force in our lives
but
so yeah i'm looking as a opportunity
and i'm looking at it as
a change
and i'm looking at it as
as
an adventure
and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid off between now and then
huh how about we end this
nice talking to you
bye
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
right
you know like the question said there's different types of camping and going out in a tent and not being around any sort of facilities shower facilities or bathroom facilities and
i don't i don't really particularly care for that you know i don't mind staying in tents with sleeping bags and everything but i like you know a bathroom near or shower near
um-hum
right you know when i was younger i would go up into colorado and you know and we'd go up and we'd hike up into the mountains and camp with tents you know and we wouldn't have anything and now that i've gotten a little older
um-hum right
um-hum
yeah
um-hum right
no
yeah that's what i like to use and they just kind of look at me and go well why are you gonna go to that trouble we have this coleman stove here
i just look at them and go
uh-huh
okay
this i'm about my fifteenth call
yeah
yeah well let's see our topic is elections
the reason i think the elections are so low and i'm not sure what they mean by eligible voters are they talking about
people that have registered or people that are old enough to vote but haven't registered
yeah
yeah well i think one of the reasons only fifty percent or so vote in the national is well for one thing just having to get to the polls
because a lot of people work and not every place will give you time to get off to go to the polls
yeah
yeah
yeah
and either that or all either have also second shifts
because a lot of people work you know hours that oh they may have two or three hours there that they could either go before or after work
but that pushes some people
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
not many people are really that knowledgeable about what the what the candidates are for or against
and a lot of the what do you call them not bonds but
yeah a lot of the bonds and other things that you're voting on people just don't know really what the whole thing's about
yeah
yeah
plus
yeah plus i think a lot of people are just flat disgusted
not realizing the way you change it is to vote
but
yeah
yeah
yeah
plus also i i'm sure that there's a legitimate reason for it but i don't understand
personally why you have to register as a democrat or republican or whatever and then being able only to vote in that race that primary
i can see in one way that the right people would try to cancel out votes
but
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah and i'm not i'm not real sure what the well i guess i do what the was i started to say what the purpose of the registration is
it seems like to me they could use either your driver's license or your social security number or something like that because
a lot of people don't vote because they didn't register
yeah
yeah
well i guess it's kind of like watching a ballgame or sports if you're not if you're not interested in the game you wouldn't you don't care whether you see it or not
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think if they made it a little more convenient they might get more votes
yeah
well i'm are you there
so what kind do you get
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
is it
yeah
yeah i don't i if i you know if i happen to find it i'll go ahead and read it someplace you know if i'm in a doctor's office or something like that but other than that i never i never liked that really
i read my newspaper i can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper to get here
but other than that
magazines i don't know there's so much advertising in them anymore
oh okay
um-hum
huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah right
yeah well i only you know subscribe to the things that i'm interested in i used to be into coin collecting so i used to get the coin magazine the paper actually is what it was you know
i used to get that so now that i'm into dolls that's about
all i really want you know
no huh-uh
i think they're interesting
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum well those travel magazines are that more or less show you different countries that you could go to or
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum okay well i don't know any other magazines i could talk to you about
you know so
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i'll be darned
uh-huh
um-hum
we don't have much in the way of heavy industry i mean this is a center for electronics and banking and insurance and you know businesses like that
but
so i i'd think you'd have to blame most of it on the automobiles here
we have we yes we occasionally have them not if they're not
not too significant
but they do occasionally occur one source of pollution for us is the dust and sand in west texas
in the spring time we'll have parts of lubbock coming to dallas
i'm serious these enormous clouds
of sand or dust or whatever you wanna call it
uh-huh
okay
i grew up in new mexico and but that was long enough ago that people didn't really heat that much with wood that was sort of a backward way of doing things if you will
but now in new mexico heating with particularly pinon pine is really an issue
not only from the pollution point of view but it takes many years to grow those trees
and people are chopping them down and heating their houses with them
it it's one of those smells you forget but then when you step outside your mother's house you go oop yep somebody's burning pinon
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
are you married and do you have a family
okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
and then we divvy them up between
our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week
and so that does help that helps a lot
and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we
found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and divide those up between all
um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or
that's true
uh-huh
yeah
well it helps you to focus
where your money goes and i'm sure you felt the same frustration before you got on a budget but
you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go
huh and also we have found that if we write down
and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know
every paycheck
and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see
we should because it does help
uh-huh
uh-huh
just stick to that uh-huh that is
uh-huh
yeah
that
that sounds like a really good idea
and it really helpful
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
i spent four years as a university professor and yeah
oh do you really that's great
no kidding
i did i did
well i was pretty young i was i had never intended to do it and i was
given the opportunity after i'd started a management consulting firm to teach in one of the business schools in the california state university system
at any rate the topic is fascinating because one of the things i've done for the past few years is
research the problem from the point of view of what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically you may be familiar with cooperative learning
well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools and what it involves basically
is the use of peer groups and the teacher becomes a sort of a consultant resource person
to the cooperative learning to the learning cooperatives i guess they're called and there are some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people
gain a competence with respect to the material
i think that the combination of technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution
in the way we learn i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system
that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators
and both teachers and parents complain about the cost and ineffectiveness that results so my feeling is that
the problem is
significant there are plenty of good people available to
offer people educational experience but that we just have to reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it and i think
certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research
of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly accelerate the pace of learning
and my feeling is that those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually i don't know what form it'll ultimately take
but i think that
the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for
inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior so it must be the way we're managing the process that
i don't
i don't think it's a matter of talented people to do it both as quote unquote students and as teachers
but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities
in the past thirty years that weren't existent you must see kids with real significant problems in some cases
course iowa city i don't know how hard how hard is it in the public school system in iowa city is it is it deteriorated a lot do the people say or are they pretty happy with it or
right
even in utah
well utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe
yeah you saw a fair number of troubled kids
yeah
yeah
what do you feel about it
oh really that's kind of creepy
yeah
well what do you think about like automatic weapons and stuff i mean those can't be used for hunting
oh really
what kind of gun do you use when you hunt
uh-huh
oh really what kind of stuff do you hunt with it
oh really
yeah
shot
but
yeah i guess i could you could probably hurt your tooth or something
oh really
yeah
ugh
uh-huh
yeah atlanta's not far behind
yeah
yeah
well mean i feel as if nobody you know if there weren't already you know so many hand guns and everything prevalent you wouldn't need you know you wouldn't need one for self-defense but it seems like there's so many of them
that it's really you know it'd be impossible to it'd be impossible to do anyway i mean people would buy them regardless whether it was legal or illegal i think
no not at all our house as a matter of fact there's some guy that walked in and stole one of my roommate's bikes while he was in the shower just the other day and that's kind of creepy to we live i live right down town and if they'd wanted to you know
yeah if they wanted to shoot me or something there wouldn't have been any problem mean they just it was in it was during the day too so obviously they don't have a whole lot of fear of
being caught by the police in anyway
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
it's just crazy i've seen the statistics on the number of deaths by hand guns in the united states compared with like canada and it's just i mean they have like you know a handful a year
i don't i don't know if there's anything that can be if gun control would solve that problem
yeah
yeah
and
that's probably true it it's a small pickup truck though it's one of those isuzu space cab types with a sunroof so it's actually not a real pickup truck you know it's got nice bucket seats so it's very comfortable and
it has with the space cab in the back i can carry some storage but i have to admit fred i i've never had a gun rack back there so i probably wouldn't fit in texas
my truck sort of puts me as a as a baltimore suburbanite i think is more you know i when i bought the truck i was going to buy a boat
and i needed something that would be able to haul a small boat but then i because i wanted to try water skiing and enjoying some water sports and things and that's one reason why i bought it but then right after i bought the truck i broke my foot
and i and the doctor said because of the type of physical therapy i got no sideward movement you know for a couple of months and that meant the whole
water skiing you know season was over so i thought well okay and then by the next year i was thinking about doing it again but i invested the money in a house
you know so
little more sound investment yes so then i still have this pickup truck and then i think well now maybe i'll you know go by the boat again and of course then i broke my foot again so the
yeah
oh yeah i love my truck in fact well my wife and i contemplate selling both of us owned pickup trucks actually when we got married so we and now we're a two pickup truck family
hers in some ways is a little more convenient and then mine's convenient other ways so it's hard to decide she has a cap on the back and she has
roof racks so we were able to carry things on the roof and able to put things in the back of her truck without them ever worrying about them getting wet or whatever
but with mine see i have a space cab so you can put like luggage immediately behind the seats and i also have bucket seats
i think family i do a little bit but surprisingly i have two of my brothers since i bought my isuzu pickup two of my brothers have bought isuzu troopers
which actually you know can open the back and just take out your backseat and you can haul washers and dryers and almost anything in them so i think i used to be
the one that was called but now everybody owns one themselves you know i do have some friends every once in a while that'll ask me and i'll of course do that you know that doesn't matter
yeah it's for a friend you'd do it anyway so it doesn't really matter
uh-huh
yeah that's true what type of car do you drive fred
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah they're nice looking i like them
oh really
oh gee
um-hum
yeah well that's see that's what i'm hoping to stop paying truck payments soon you know that's i think that's payments are important what you so but your wife drives a mercury topaz they're nice too
um-hum
um-hum
yeah so you've gone
yeah back to visit family
have you driven back to visit family
in indiana
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh that's really good yeah
um-hum
yeah is gas mileage an important reason why you buy the cars you do
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well i take it you don't have you don't have kids then
because if you had if you had kids you wouldn't say anything about sportier looking you'd be saying things like it has a good backseat
no we well we're just recently married in december
but that's we laugh now my wife says we should sell my truck and i say we should sell hers
and i said well the reason why we should sell yours laura is because see mine has the space cab and it actually has little drop seats in the space area with seat belts i said and we can seat buckle in a car seat there
so we should get rid of yours because the three of us won't be able to go on trips i said but we can go on trips in mine you know we can travel anywhere with my truck so that's you know we i laugh about that um-hum
yeah
well the ford ones
yeah i think i think ford was one of the first ones to step into that new that new almost shuttle space shuttle like appearance and i think they've done they've really come on strong with some of that
wind resistance and energy saving and developments i think that that's their station wagon i think those are fords but i do i like those
yeah now the station wagon looks sleek it looks yeah
and hopefully i think you know it's supposed to get better gas mileage and i think that's becoming an important thing too my wife and i've been discussing is you know looking for a car when we do get rid of one of the trucks we'll probably look for a car that gets good gas mileage
just because
it just has become such an important thing i think for the environment and for the economy and everything you know to start to pay attention to that more and more
no i think i think the reason why i bought the isuzu is because you know i looked almost all the small trucks are made by japanese anyway
there's only a couple of them like i looked the first place i went were the were dodge chrysler plymouth and you know i went to a number of them and i priced them all out and i was just the i was almost going to buy a chrysler which was actually a mitsubishi truck
but the salesman insulted me the guy the salesman you know they always do that deal with you where they say well i got to go talk to my manager well here the manager's actually the guy that owns the place and in this small town we live on he's always on tv
and he comes out of his office and i asked him for i said well you know it was like maybe eighty three hundred dollars for this truck
and i said well i i'd like it for eight thousand dollars i said for eight thousand dollars i'll you know i'll write out the down payment now and you know because i can get i can get financing through my credit
because i'd checked about financing and everything you know i said i'll for eight thousand dollars i'll take it you know because it was oh sort of marked down you know and the and the guy came out of the back and insulted me he said
he said you want a truck for under eight thousand dollars go back to the used lot it's behind the building and he walked away
i guess it was a sales technique he thought he was going to pressure me into giving up that three hundred dollars that i asked for i don't know and i said i said i looked at the salesman i said i'm sorry your boss just insulted me i can't it's against my pride to buy a truck here now
and i felt really bad i walked out and the guy
called me at home the next couple of days it was terrible but you know i walked out i got in to my brother was actually with me shopping for a car and we drove down the street
and he said why don't you just look in here and we went into the isuzu dealer because my brother always had this love for an isuzu trooper he wanted one you know
and we walked in and here there was a demonstrator model on sale like ninety six hundred dollars with everything
hello this is jim in dallas how you doing
oh you're right here okay yeah i'm actually working tonight i just called and came in
so do you work at ti
yeah i just got a little booklet this not what we're supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts and i thought oh i better make some calls
my daughter got a few calls at home she talked to some student in i guess they give them to computer students too
and
virginia or something like that she's talked to two students
yeah
oh yeah great we're supposed to talk about the elderly now i guess
do you have anybody that you are close to that decision on or anything or i've thought about it for myself and all and my wife's mother is
in a retirement home she's not in a nursing home
yeah did i did we push
i did it right as she said yeah
but she's down in san antonio it's a
it's a brand new one it's a catholic
retirement home for nuns it's at trinity no let me see trinity i keep calling it it's not trinity i'll think of
incarnate word and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people
yeah and that one's really super now i know what they're talking about on regular retirement yeah there's not too many they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses
and then they have other wings that we visited that are very nice i mean it's just super
oh yeah they have like a guard with locks we've been there once at night at christmas she just went in last year
she drives and everything she she's perfectly healthy
well her husband died they were in the military together and she just did not want to take care of the house
and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind so to speak and so
she's happy as heck and they have serve meals of course
and they have clubs and a swimming pool so that's nice now i
i know the ones where you're really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one
and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really sick it's a tough question
oh you got more experience than i do then on it
yeah
oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know
um-hum
yeah i think that hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it and they're getting nicer
i've seen on tv where they take animals and young children in fact my daughter is one my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home and boy that really pumps them up that
is very nice to see young people i think that's one of the sad things is when you're in an older home
if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you can't take care of them
obvious you can't take care of children or animals in a nursing home but it's nice to have them visit and everything
yeah
right
yeah i think you do get more by stimulation my in fact my mother-in-law just visited she's just about seventy five again perfectly fine
but one and she visit us here in dallas
and our routine has come obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she's much and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around that's the fastest way to die i think you know
oh yeah i'm afraid i'm a tv flipper anything bad i like i like to flip i flip it off but it is sad it's sad yeah
oh yeah
yeah
right when i was younger we i lived in the east i'm from the east really
and it seemed like there several people that i knew that had their parents i guess they would be but well in their seventy living with them
and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old and i guess she had her own separate room and i think whether it's more a custom up there or maybe because i was younger and it's just not a custom anymore
to have you know the grandparents live with you anymore i guess that well we are getting away from that which is not right
oh yeah
oh right
yeah
oh
well that's nice in a lot of ways
that's what i think about it for me i think well my kids better not do that to me i don't want that you know so i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than
you know it's easy to say well yeah let's put these old folks in a home but when i think i don't want to do that you know i don't want to be have my little home i always threaten my daughters i say well
i'm going to build a little house behind yours and then and i'll take care of your lawn he says but i'm not going to one of those places right yeah
that's what we that's the way we call it which is really wrong but my wife's mother and the one she's in san it's you know it's everything but the opposite of what you've seen i mean it's a little hotel you might say and
again a swimming pool and grounds
and she has enough room she has two bedrooms and a and a separate living area
they don't have kitchens or anything but they have little it's like
on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal you know
oh yeah it's nothing like that it's like living in the hotel i mean she's totally on her own
and she still drives which we do does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know
and we keep thinking about that you know because she they get less alert and they don't care and i've seen some of these elderly people on tv you know the ones from florida that just run into people and they don't even understand what happened you know
i know
i know go ahead i'm sorry
oh he still drives
that's well it's wonderful in one respect but i don't know if you can afford the insurance yeah
yeah
right
that's good i mean people are all different
i wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe not take their license maybe give them a refresher driving course and just to just to see how well they are every five years
are they doing it
yeah
well everybody needs retraining it doesn't hurt
after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving it would it would sure the insurance companies would probably help pay for some of that you know
right there you go there's a good point very good point
oh have you ever thought about joining the peace corps
yeah was that was pretty much my thought too
the idea of like you know spending like two years in a village in uganda is you know teaching people how to like you know
uh-huh
i you know i thought that joining the peace corps was something that everybody did like in the sixties you know in
uh-huh
i yeah i talked to i was talking to somebody the other day and they said i think they went they were in the peace corps and they ended up going to like central america or something and
they ended up in this place where they hadn't seen a white face in like you know seventy five years
and they had to go on the it's like they had it it's the typical third world story you know they had to every once a week they had to get on the bus and then like drive up into and
take drive up into the mountains and stop at each village you know and have like give lectures on like public health and stuff
and it's like the children would come up and like touch him because you know they had never seen somebody that light you know a gringo and that it was it was pretty it was really pretty strange
i would really be afraid of i don't know when i went to school i
i took a course in parasitology and stuff like that i would really be afraid of like you know of all the diseases and stuff that i could catch and like and man it seems like a hell of a way to lose weight
uh-huh i
no it doesn't seem like the kind of job that i i'd really be i'm really interested in either
oh i'm a i'm an engineer yeah
lockheed
yeah we they have a we work for some lockheed sanders we don't build the aircraft per se we work on the like the avionics yeah we put the
yeah they were bought out by lockheed and it's a they were they were involved like in radars and thing and things like that
uh-huh who do you work for
oh uh-huh
yeah we it it's not bad it's not bad work although i'll tell you it's like
i being in the defense industry is not is not really the thing to be in right now
i haven't seen a new hire somebody you know just fresh out of college brought into the company in like a year and a half
and what's happening is that you know we're just like kind of getting grayer and grayer and grayer you know the there's no growth here
um-hum
a building permit yeah
um-hum
huh
did they fine you or what
okay
um-hum
um-hum
yeah uh-huh
oh you're kidding
so how'd you finally get a permit
you're kidding did you finish it
did you finish it
and without a permit
yeah that is funny
um-hum
huh you've got to get a permit even to like remodel a bathroom
that right
jimminy christmas
hum i didn't realize they were that stringent i -ve done a little bit of remodeling on my house i'm an accountant but i sure enjoy
you know messed around and doing some things and i finished a couple rooms in the basement and i built a real nice storage shed on a concrete foundation and i've never got a building permit yeah in fact i
i know
huh
i'm thinking about building a room on my house and i you know i haven't thought twice about getting a permit
um-hum
-ell i'm not sure i think i'm supposed to have one i just never have gotten one
uh-huh
um-hum
is that huh
uh-huh
yeah
well that's interesting well i know you don't have any good horror stories about home repair then because you probably don't have any problem if you're in the profession
um-hum
do you install metal roofs
or
or just the asphalt type shingle
uh-huh but like if you were doing a if somebody a residential person house wanted you to come in and reroof their house but you do that kind of stuff uh-huh
what's your opinion about those i'm my home's gonna need to be either reshingled or reroofed in the near future we don't have a lot of heavy snow right here in twin falls
but i was looking towards getting a whole aluminum you know or metal or whatever is
in what way
hum more so than the asphalt shingles
yeah that same with me same with me
garth brooks yeah that yeah that's the other guy i was thinking of was garth brooks yeah fact i think both of them have performed here
and kenny rogers he's kind of country western verge you know on the verge of country western
oh wonderful
well then of course you like him that's great so well i have teenage children and so you know i'm hear the rock music not the hard rock but the you know
michael bolton type stuff he he's my personal favorite
oh that's good
um-hum
no what i don't i don't actually we don't listen to any elevator music at my house but i've got teenagers so
yeah that's good i actually when i'm home alone which isn't too often but
our public radio station has wonderful classical music
it's just very wonderful soothing and you know a lot of symphonies and i just i love that that's probably my all time favorite
hm
right
right
relax yeah
what do you teach what grade
good for you
a certain subject
good for you
i was just sitting here while she was trying to find a
i play i play piano i took lessons for thirteen years and right now my nine year old is taking piano
and i just got a whole mess of music i play the volunteered to play the piano at the children's christmas program for the whole grade school which is k through six
my older daughter plays the saxophone my next son plays the drums and my third son just started baritone this year and my little girl will start french horn next year so
french horn is absolutely wonderful instrument it's just my favorite course that's what i played and so
i'm pushing that on my daughter because i wanna play in our city band not the symphony we just the city band once we get the french horn and i get a little bit more time right now i'm busy chasing my kids
lot of and then their concert band and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in and my son will be in next year that's i mean they play college level music in junior high he's that good of an instructor and the kids just love him
so it's really good it is wonderful
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
okay
all right well i guess you know i wasn't expecting that question about aids so i haven't thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research i'm just concerned that it's just going to be such a major health problem
and if we you know and if it's not i say it would seem to me the sooner we take care of it the better off we're going to be
well that's what i think and it's going to start affecting all of the population you know i mean right now yeah you know and it's just going to become such a huge issue
and it's just so scary that there's just not much that can be done at this point so i guess
yes
yeah
right
yeah
well i think so too and so i guess i would you know personally i would be really in favor of that now i have had i have two friends who've died of it
and so and those have just you know it's just been real hard and i just hate seeing people you know go through this
so and i keep thinking it's going to hit our church eventually you know it's like it's real interesting to me that we've not had anybody yet but you know it's going to just start affecting i think everyone
i know
it is really scary you know i thought of that for myself for like for my children this whole issue of the whole blood issue is very scary
because you know people don't know that's the thing there's a there's a time factor in there
i know
i know
well that's right and i think you know people give blood innocently enough assuming that they're okay i don't suppose anybody would give blood if they felt they i don't know i guess they might but
you know i would hate to be in a position where i would need a transfusion or my children i think it would be a real scary thing
oh
yeah really
there yeah right well because yeah then what are they going to do
they have no other alternatives i suppose
well i don't know i mean i just but then i think well yeah i guess that basically i do think we just need more research because that's going to sort of be the our only answer
well and i worry you know the older my children get the more chances of exposure they're going to have i mean i can't imagine well even for you being a single person i mean i think gosh how scary you know to meet people and
you know
i mean
i know well it's just a it's just a sad thing and i don't know hopefully this is going to get taken care of at some point
yeah
oh this was your husband wasn't it that's right i've forgotten that you told me that but i'd forgotten
uh-huh
azt
hum
well i know and you know and make it available to people that can use it i you know if i were sick i would try anything i think i mean what do you have to lose
i mean that's what's that's what's so crazy i mean what's to lose at this point
i would if it were me
yeah i mean yeah you'd want you'd want everything available and then to think well it's available but you i mean you know you could only get it in europe
would be a terrible
that would be a terrible thing
but how long was he how long was randy sick
hum
yeah
hm
so he was really susceptible
that's awful
huh
um-hum
well in some ways that's a blessing
i mean it's such a
awful thing to suffer through
well my
huh
yeah
yeah
well i know it is well my two friends both one lived a fairly long time with it i'd say ken had it
well he thinks he had he was hiv for ten years you know i mean he no he thinks he had it even back in the early eighties
and then he died in eighty nine
so and then
and it's a vacation home
oh i see
oh okay
originally from oklahoma city
wow twenty years is a long time
so yours is your home right now is typical of the ones that are in the area
huh
okay
it's a salt box that's a it's a new england
type
i was born and brought up in the area that i lived in and it was very rural and there was nothing there but
farms
or orchards one or the other you know there was a lot of apple orchards so when we decided to build we built
about thirteen years ago we looked for a home and the things that we were seeing were
not up to my standards they were still building homes back then like they have for
a hundred and fifty years you know the very little insulation in the walls and very little insulation in the ceiling so
yeah and it was
it wasn't what we wanted so we did some research and i knew the land there's a lot of ledge up here so you have to be careful
their septic systems when there's no public sewer system
there is water however so we picked out a piece of land that we liked and we bought it and then we decided to build so we did a lot of research like i said and we
and we built a typical new england salt box in the area and when we built we were the first home there was like about
ten acres of oak forest around us
and it was absolutely gorgeous since then however they've torn it all down and we're surrounded by homes you know that's a that's another long story but
we're the only typical new england home in the area there's a lot of there's an english tudor right next to us and there's a colonial our street's on just a short street there's only like six homes on it
and there's a an english colonial down on the corner and the rest are raised ranches and you know the typical home
some rough plans out to an architect to have him draw it up and then i subbed out the things that i couldn't do like i had a crew come in and frame it and i did the rest i did the inside the wiring the plumbing and you know
so we built the walls huh
my dad had built a couple when we were growing up so kind of got used to it and we did a lot of research
we made the kitchen a working kitchen i think i would've made the kitchen a lot bigger because both of us like to cook
and right now a working kitchen is very efficient but
two people kind of get in each other's way yeah it's similar to a galley kitchen yeah and then we have a like a little dining area off that we have a formal dining room
i've since added onto the house we've got like looks like an old rustic log cabin on the inside
it's all natural wood the ceiling's pine the walls are pine you know it's one of those type kick around rooms
and we put a greenhouse on it was designed to be heated by the sun
it works fine as long as you don't put any plants in it
yes
oh are you
oh
we raise orchids
which is a little bit tough to do up here in the north but it's a solar greenhouse we put up you know like the walls are six inches thick
no we used fiberglass we're the greenhouse faces solar south
and it's double glazed fiberglass with a one inch airspace in between it
so the way it was designed was to
i put a four foot foundation under it and put in twenty two ton of rock with hot air piped through it
and all day long it just heats up and then at night it just gives it back into the house
i'd like a little bit warm land i'd like to go up further north and i'd like to instead of having a salt box i'd like to have it all on one floor
so you got your garden planted
it's probably gotten just a little bit too warm now we have trouble up here with
yeah no i put down black plastic
so anyhow that's what we've done for our house we've left it all natural so there's no upkeep you know it's white cedar shingle
and the trim is stained so i don't have to go out and scrape and paint
because i figured when i got old and retire i don't want to be working i don't be a slave to the home
right because that peek is twenty eight feet high and you come off twenty eight feet and it hurts so
yes you too
okay yeah all right you take care okay bye-bye
no i haven't the only thing i had to i had to return was a table top but that was like three years ago of a dining room table that i got
it was marked on the top of it so all they did was replace it
but as far as lawn mowers i've bought lawn mowers in the last three and a half years
and they've been working fine my hedger's working fine my weedeater's working fine i haven't really had to return anything you know except that table top that was marked
no i said anything
oh you did
uh-huh
huh
um-hum
um-hum
well did they give you any problem or they just give you a new one or what
yeah right
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah if you go and buy something really good usually it is it's good you know
and you don't ever anyhow i've haven't ever had any problems in returning anything
that i've bought that i feel that you know was worth the money that you pay for it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i i've been really lucky knock on wood you know like i say that i haven't had to return anything except this table when it came out
the top of it was marked and so all i did was replace the top of it you know
they gave me well no i didn't go to the store and get it they you know got with the manufacturer and then when it came in then they brought it out and then just took this table top off and replaced it with the other table top
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
uh-huh
yeah with
or with a veneer top or something like that probably yeah
uh-huh
oh for crying out loud
um-hum
but you know but
yeah i was just i was just trying to think of what else have i bought
the only other thing that when we moved in this house it was a new house and the grate where you have your fireplace
well since you live close i don't know if you know about what lewisville's doing with recycling are you familiar with any of that
yeah i you know i read you know when they first started doing that in the paper and i read about that i was just praying that you know that would be in our area because we've been recycling for quite sometime and
and so when that thing came up in wal-mart's parking lot we thought oh this is great and we started taking it up there and then all the sudden it disappeared you know i didn't
newspapers i couldn't even think of what you call them plastic milk cartons and newspapers and cans and glass i guess is the is really the four things that we do
yeah
and really i think that's about that's really about it is there anyplace else that really takes anything other than that you know of
oh really
it was a real hassle and i'm going are we really gonna do this but you kind of get i guess into a little routine you know and it just kind of is automatic now to throw different things in different places you know
so i've just got you know we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and i've just got three trash cans sitting in there you know and we just kind of dump things in each one as you know as we get them so
they do too and they're impossible to crush i mean you can't get them down to any size you know i mean you know you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag you know pretty easily so yeah
oh really
yeah
yeah
oh well that'll be good
sure yeah let somebody get something out of it yeah that's true
no
yeah there was a that ti's got this organization called tad which is tiers against drugs
and you know we're recycling aluminum cans up here and you know just what you'd buy out of the machines and drink here and there's crushers out in all of the hallways you know and they're and that's and they use the money from that to fund this
tiers against drugs program it's you know ti doesn't give them any money all everything is made from that
and they had talked about having a thing where like one saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home you know
and i'm kind of like you i wish they would do that because so at least i knew somebody you know was getting the money out of it you know that was gonna use it for good so
oh do they really curbside pick up i really hope they do that in lewisville it'd make it a lot easier on all of us
get us going
are you at ti austin or
oh that's great no my daughter has talked to my daughter up here with us i have another one and she's talked to students so i guess they have
sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things so they're if you're a computer user so my daughter has talked to two students that were non tiers so i guess oh yeah
we're on finances have you have you retired or
oh
oh yeah
oh yeah it's that's the finances i guess we're on the subject of finances it is tough i've been with ti i'm just going to be fifteen years this year and that's a tough thing
the salary thing ti doesn't quite always do it right well what about our financial budget well you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you're
right sure
well i guess i do i do have a long term budget i got a daughter in college and one going to be in college so that i've been thinking about that for quite a while now monthly no i'll tell you a funny story about budgeting
i've been married twenty six years
and i did you know that the macho thing the man always did the bills for i don't know fifteen years or more and i got so sick of it trying to balance the budget
one and i always tried to show my wife you know here's how you once a year i'd say here's how you do the budget in case i get sick or here's how you do the checks you know
one day i gave her the checkbook and i said i'm not doing this anymore you do it you learn it and i've been happy ever since
right
right oh yeah
yes i think that is a tough we all seems to seems to be that way
yeah
yeah that's you need to do that i'll give you a hint
i don't know if you're a radio talk person listener do you listen to radio talk shows
listen to bruce williams for financial advice he's on oh i don't know what he's going to be in austin he's on five seventy here oh he's nationally famous
he's a college graduate type guy he's been in all he's an entrepreneur and he gives very practical financial advice about
cars very you know not nothing college level basic stuff his name is bruce williams
he's on national radio i don't know what it would be down there you might want to whatever your radio talk shows are down there he's on that channel it's five seventy up here
and i'd listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when i'm doing chores and he gives a wealth of information very practical stuff and
he will help you avoid a lot of little things financially
he
yeah there there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget and i i'm not expert again because i don't really do it monthly
right i did start a college fund i'm not i have one again at ut down there now her first year and she's almost gone through her whole college fund you know
sure go ahead sure
oh no yeah right they give us ten minutes the only advice i give you on college would be there's a lot of scholarship money out there my daughter got a little bit not much only first year she got about two thousand dollars worth
and you ought to as your daughters approach the college age start finding out about the scholarship money because there is a lot of money out there and
band she got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip
through bands through leadership there's all kinds of civic organizations that will give you know one shot money
you get a president's award if you're in high school doing this up area in arlington
there's a lot of and of course you if you score high on the sat you can get you know two thousand a year you know or more
you can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades she did very well in school and but she only got first year money she got about two thousand dollars it was only five hundred dollars at a clip from this organization
we called there were there were two or three people there was some little civic organization in dallas that gave money away and only two or three people applied she applied and got five hundred dollars from that
so
look into that bit
the year that they graduate you know before though you know while they're graduating there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything
and they don't even have a dozen applicants because the kids are going off after the big money
of course you have to have some sort of record in high school of achievement and everything but sometimes
it's just like our band gave money away we're a band booster club we gave we give two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids who we think were worthy you know so
there's money out there
go ahead you can talk i don't want to i want to chew up the whole line here
oh i'm an engineer i'm in fact i'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything my job there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved
and so they put me on nights i call this my recession job and i'm working nights just kind of covering shutdown equipment and everything and just being available here i don't mind
it beats being laid off and everything and you got to be a little flexible in my old age i'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school
and then i'd like to teach maybe mathematics or something i'm trying to study for that now
right
um-hum
oh yeah
right
oh sure
well it's tough right now for everybody up here in the dallas metroplex it's awful hey i've got another clue for you for college
another clue for you for college money go to work for ut
we have a friend who works who is a secretary for tcu you know up here they give you scholarship a hundred percent
if you're if you work for tcu
yes so check that one out you know
ask them about it call them and because it's full scholarship now it's not room and board but it's tuition full tuition paid if your parent works at tcu
and her mother went over there just for that
well i'm pretty pro gun control over all i am
i must say that there are a couple of arguments against strong gun control which i find very compelling although most of the people who argue gun control with me i find
use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the nra slogan arguments and
so i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it
in terms of fair restricting guns and i have to admit most of that is strong personal distaste i don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort
and guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me
i'll give it a try i've got my texan stereotypes in place
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
okay
um-hum that applies to anything as well as guns
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
but if you're not a if you're not a basically good citizen you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway
so why
so why have any restrictions at all
yeah
um-hum
well we could be
well that makes a lot of since to me i mean i certainly feel that if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but
i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm they have as much responsibility to know how to do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so
well i'm still i'm still puzzled though what is the argument how does the argument work if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway
what's the point of putting a restriction basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway they're not going to take those courses is it is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns
if it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices is that main advantage
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum no bay area san francisco bay area
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i
yeah
well i'm sure i'm sure given all your training i'm sure that
you know far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything
i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone who hasn't yet used a gun in a haven't hasn't yet committed a felony
if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire
it's hard for me to imagine that a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah don't it
no i understand that what if what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake
yeah well that was the topic
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well as someone who would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander i feel more comfortable with people having blades because
yeah
is it really
we've had him for let's see he just had his fourth birthday
yeah and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
and
he's pretty okay we like him
he does that's the one thing we don't like about him in fact we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off
he'd probably look pretty funny if we did that
he actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything and they put him on the scale and he's up to ninety four now
but he's not a real he's not a real tall dog for a golden retriever he's kind of stocky shorter and stockier
he is it's just me and my wife and he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids i we treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten
uh-huh
yeah
that's probably a good idea they're good though have you ever had a retriever before
because i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs they don't tend to get real jealous or territorial they like to play
and especially with kids they love to play with kids in
no he's pretty much an inside dog
he stays in we we're kind of in a not a real busy neighborhood but more so than i'd want him to be out too much and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside he's really a wimp
and when it comes to being alone now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that but he does not like to be tied outside he'll just bark and bark and bark
no he's taken to the training pretty well and he knows where our yard is and we have a pretty small yard but he seems to know the boundaries
and he usually is good about staying within them although our next door neighbors have a dog too and she is good friends with my dog
and so he often gets
to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff but he's pretty he stays out of the street and if i catch him i call him and he comes back
so he he's pretty good about taking to commands and things
no we never did
i trained him on my own and this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult
we've had or we've had dogs when i was a kid but this is the first one that i took in so i wasn't sure if i'd be able to get it all right the first time
but he seems to have picked it up pretty well i never really had to hit him or anything just you know firm tone of voice
and those sorts of things i see other people out there and they hit their dogs and try to and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing least i think
invisible fencing have you heard of that
it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
and if they get too close to that perimeter it zaps them yeah
yeah well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to so he held on to the collar and he walked out to the perimeter he said it was a good jolt
yeah so i don't take too well to those sorts of training techniques i don't think they're always necessary if you put enough patience into
um-hum
it's is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat
somebody just told me that because of the leukemia
wow quite a difference what kind of climate do you have
oh
i live in richardson texas
you bet
well see our subject was gun control
i'm sort of prejitice prejudiced on this subject because that's my vocation that's what i do for a living
because i'm a i'm a manufacturer's sales rep and i sell hunting and shooting supplies
working for eighteen different companies so
i would guess i would be sort of pro
okay
i agree one hundred percent
i agree with you one hundred percent jean i'll tell you that somewhere i saw a bumper sticker years ago i'd like to see more of them i think speaking from my viewpoint think it read something like when guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns
and i think that sort of speaks for itself i believe
in some gun control
but i think it's and i you know in selling to the or selling for the industry to dealers i think that it's the federal government's
stand that should be taken and i think that dealers now or to buy a gun now an individual just has to go in a store and show his drivers license and if he
has a texas state drivers license and if he lives in texas he can go to any gun dealer and buy a gun merely by filling out a yellow form and paying for the firearm and leaving
right it would be it would be handy if they had you know computers being like they are if they'd have some kind of a
computer program on a national level where you could just dial an eight hundred number and
and run a check on someone
i would be for something like that
that's true
absolutely
yeah
you bet absolutely
well that's wonderful
well that's great we've always done the same thing and
being in the business i've sold guns for twenty seven years i'm fifty two years old and i've sold guns for twenty seven years worked for some major manufacturers like winchester and people like that and
and i always consider a firearm i know they're very dangerous but i always consider everything a sporting firearm and i realize that
just as you say some people don't think of them as that but that's how i think of them being that i'm in the business but main thing is just be education and communication on the subject
and that's something we have always tried to do
and
i'm a strong believer in that
absolutely right
right
yeah
well i could play the woodchuck song
yeah
yeah
yeah
do you sing at choir at your church yeah
yeah i tried out for choir when i was think in the seventh grade and they wouldn't let me in
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i don't
to so you listen to kind of church music gospel
oh yeah
oh yeah
oh yeah the geezer music as i call it yeah my boss listens to that we listen to ninety seven point nine and that's his station so i call it the geezer music
huh yeah
okay
where did you go
uh-huh
yeah
well you know that's something i've never done is go down to the keys although i i'm just here on business but i would love to go down there
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well i've never done any motor home camping although it is more attractive to me now than it used to be
when i was a kid we used to go camping up in the ozarks in arkansas
to get back up into it and it had no electricity and it had a hand pump for water
but it was on a lake that was just crystal clear and we would spend a week up there you know and they had a little country store about ten miles away that you could get you know minimal provisions so you pretty much had to carry everything you needed with you
but that was it was great fun but since then i honestly have not done much what you could call camping
but yeah i've got a i've got a friend of mine in houston who has a forty two foot tartan sailboat
and it which has for me has been the best of all worlds because he's got the expense and i get the pleasure of going out on it
well that's hard work
yeah i've been with it on several races we've run the pensacola yacht race for a couple of years
and but no i love to sail and i agree i had never really thought about that as camping before but that is probably one of the best ways to go
what did you do did you rent a motor home when you came to florida
was it what is that expensive
well that's cheaper than a hotel room really
uh-huh
how big was the one you rented
yeah was that any problem driving or
yeah
oh really
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh sure yeah that always irritates me when i pass somebody several times i've been in the other in the other had the shoe on the other foot
uh-huh
yeah
yeah right
good morning my name is jean
oh where you from tina
oh garland texas i'm in pennsylvania
do you work for texas instruments
uh-huh huh
most of them do now i don't have anybody that works for ti but
so i guess we're supposed to talk about foods today
yes uh-huh you ready okay
foods like you would plan for a dinner party or something like that yeah
um-hum
oh uh-huh
right
yeah and it's not as good as if it's fresh it
uh-huh
is that right yeah
well they probably were trying to do the best they could yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah well they do in the summertime i think that tea big in the summertime mostly of course you have warmer weather most of the time
so
yeah so i
is that right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh more like covered dishes for those type of dinners
yeah we really use most anything i
your
bread family and your or least what it used to be the regular menu followed and ham and bake potatoes and
something from each area that you're supposed to choose from
and we ourselves are into the wok cooking you know they been advertising that and we've really been enjoying those meals
they have a lot of vegetable to them and they really are very good
it it's much different and
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh those always go good
yeah
yeah
oh really well maybe that's good the way the things are going
uh-huh
right children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers and that and it is easier to chew
uh-huh
we don't really have you know entertain too much
i don't know if you do or not but we don't a whole lot we're more once in a while but mostly family activities
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well that's good
um-hum
yeah we do a lot of that type thing at church and our homemakers meet at the church also and that's what we do mostly most of the time for that
yeah but it doesn't happen very often usually you get a pretty wide variety and you can you can have a pretty good meals from one of those
oh those are fun
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
they were suppose to keep
yeah that's kind of irresponsible but that upset you because they are grown adults usually and they know they know better even if they can't do it they can always need to get somebody else that could
right
they said that we could share we share a recipe but i'm up at my daughter's i don't even have any of my recipes with me you know
oh
oh great
they're ready to go well i we probably have we talked long enough i'm i
okay so i'll let oh same here you have a good day
uh-huh bye-bye
oh is that right uh-huh
but we used to live in california and we did a little bit of camping in california not all that much but enough to get a little flavor for it where mostly do you go with your camping
oh who am i talking to
you know this is really funny because i i've tried to make these phone calls whenever it pops in my head and sometimes they say oh we can't find another party and after
do the tours and the little classes and the lectures and everything were quite extraordinary so that was one of our major camping times that we enjoyed very much
oh yes
uh-huh
oh my
um-hum
um-hum
oh that's true too
uh-huh
we took one canoe trip in california now but the boys were very small when we were out there and it was a friend of webbie's that got this group together
and there had been some rains and therefore the river was a little more swift than what might normally be expected and
i found it exciting but i really thought that it was a trifle dangerous maybe because the currents were kind of bad and we just went ahead anyway but it was the russian river yeah
yeah
yeah it can and it did and it was my first time it was webbie's first time doing this also and we just trusted in the knowledge of
this friend that got this party together that it would not be over dangerous and we had our
life belts on and everything else like that but we did dump over once and you know with small children like that just made me very nervous we didn't go again the next day we just kind of
really very nice and i wouldn't mind doing something like that again
it was quite an experience
um-hum yeah so
no he's not gonna go again this time but you're gonna inherit sean on this trip and um-hum
i know uh-huh have you been out there before oh you well daniel says it's i think it's really quite challenging
absolutely i kind of got the information by drips and drabs from last summer as different friends would talk to him and apparently whoever has to carry that water or part
okay now the town i live in they started a recycling program
in the certain small part of town a little couple neighborhoods
and they said that they were disappointed in the response that people they tried to promote it and everything but i don't think the city necessarily supported what the they were doing
yeah i don't think they really encouraged it i don't think they really made it well-known how to do it that's my perception
but
yeah there used to be a big trash bin several trash bins in front of the wal-mart in town here that you could put plastic jugs on one side and newspapers on another and glass on the third
but
that has been taken away it's not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because people really brought stuff to it all the time and then they took it away for no real reason that i can understand or i ever heard about
and it's not there anymore and the only place to take things to recycle them is like clear off on the other side of town and who's going to do that very few people
is that right
yeah how do they monitor that though i wonder
hum
yeah
yeah it would definitely help you know even if they were to pay like for recycling aluminum or
newspapers or whatever i mean they used to be that if you well like grocery stores you buy pop and you had a deposit on the bottle you bring the bottle back you get a nickel per bottle back or whatever you know that encourages you not to throw it away you'd take it back and
and get your money back or at least exchange it for another bottle that's full you know
i haven't seen that done for a long time either
yeah everything's no deposit no return or else it's all plastic jugs that you just pitch you know
yeah
is that right
hum
hum
i wasn't aware of that i thought they were more or less all the same
there needs to be legislation that they should all be the same plastic
yeah
or at least have you know a bunch of collection bins around the city you know if they had one
for every five thousand people
or two thousand people
you know just scattered throughout the city you know who wouldn't mind just you know why going down that way anyway just throw things in the back of your car and
and take them down and throw it in there i mean i think that would be great i i'd support that entirely because
you know as a country we produce way too much garbage it's phenomenal
oh yeah
where i work there they have recycled paper
thing so you just you have two trash cans in your office one is for the regular
non recyclable trash and is for paper yeah and you know i think it's great i use it all the time
you know and i read that the companies now save like what fifteen thousand trees or whatever because of that and i thought that's great
you know
yeah
is that right
yeah
yeah
i've always wondered why they haven't taken some of these recycled plastics and made them into like plastic boards to build a house with instead of making it out of wood lumber make it out of out of plastic boards
is that right
yeah
yeah that that's a problem
that's right
well
that's about all i have to say tonight
what's that
yeah so did i but i thought i'd try one more time and sure enough it's okay
well thanks for talking and
see you later bye
i say arlington texas now because i talked to one night to somebody in arlington virginia
oh do they have one
how much time do you spend with your children
oh what
oh yeah well mine's are down at ut austin in college and the other one's in high school so you do spend less time then because
oh that's kind of nice though you
you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday huh
well that's true
they have to see their other parent i guess too
i know
right
i know that's what my mother said one time
right
no that's true and if they force them to you know that's not good either
well do they all live in the area
um-hum oh wow
um-hum
golly
how'd they end up so far away
uh-huh
those are the youngest ones
um-hum
boy that those are a long way how'd
um-hum
um-hum
vermont so they wanted to make their homes there huh
my goodness are they are those two married
um-hum
i mean i've got a daughter that's a sophomore at ut and i'm going to uta right now myself so it's never too late
right especially in some of these schools around here i think they have about twenty percent older students
but no
oh yeah you're really ready to learn finally i mean i don't know why i even went to college when i was seventeen it was a complete waste of money
right now we're
right and
um-hum
what was it how what do the trends in families and do we approve of what other families do
that's right
a change i was gonna say the same thing
um-hum
right
right
or gonna have sauce on the bone huh
um-hum
oh
well i like i guess it would be easier to say tell you what kind i don't like i don't like hard rock
but other than that i like just about every kind i
i'm not real crazy about modern country and western i like the old
country western songs that i grew up with
san antonio rose
and the sons of the pioneers cool water and that sort of thing
yeah
um-hum
no
um-hum
yeah and i like the old hank williams songs
but the modern kind it seems to me it all sounds just pretty much alike
yeah well
it's hard to tell one song yeah it's hard to tell one song from the other
too be truthful with you i'm sort of a beethoven and bach fan
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i have a good friend who grew up in mexico she's been in this country oh about twelve fifteen years
and
she gave me a tape of some spanish music
oh what is that dance
with the ladies in the long dress and the fans
yeah flamenco
it's modern day flamenco music
yeah and it's really different and it's really pretty
um-hum
um-hum
well there're two schools of thought on that
and then i took a semester as an elective i took a semester of class piano and i have a piano and an and an organ not a very fancy organ
but it's an old hammond
and i can sight read most church hymns
and
oh the first movement of moonlight sonata that goes of course very slowly
no not as on a regular basis
i
that's going to be my retirement
yeah i do sing in my church choir
yeah
yeah so i do keep up to that extent
do you play any instruments
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
listen let me tell you what my retirement job's going to be
i've just been to the meyerson one time and the first part was oh schubert and you know the usual stuff and then there was this very modern day
piece that had no rhythm no tune and just sounded like a bunch of racket
and in the middle of the stage was this box about oh four by four by four covered with black what i have no idea
yeah to a point it's not my best subject
there's all lizards and things running around that people who live there they just they take it for granted and it's like we go down there on vacation it's like oh how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house
yeah their very corrupt like the panamanians are were very corrupt
the thing about it is like the panamanians is a lot of servicemen down there a lot of a lot even our american servicemen are involved
because i guess there was a big scam they set all these guys up and like a dozen servicemen got caught for running a drug ring
it's very pro american
and we have i my girlfriend used to be in the navy and she was based in panama
in honduras its very pro american and there's a lot of i don't know how many american soldiers are there but there's a lot i mean they
and you can't the american government you can't trust them either because you think
you don't know how corrupt they are i mean they keep people in power like the shah of iran and things like that i mean it's the lesser of two evils they'll probably you know say this is the lesser of two evils
but i don't know how corrupt the honduran government is but the
yeah good see that's the thing that is going to have to that's the undoing of everything is that we have no morals i mean
talk about the crime and all that in the city it's just the kids have no morals and stuff that's the thing that will eventually you know if anyone is going to be saved it is having a good moral background
but it's funny you will mention costa rica because i guess they're one of the most successful and peaceful countries in central america
so i was reading an article in national geographic and i don't know i don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries they don't have oil or anything and they don't have big tourism
so maybe it is their faith that has enabled them to keep the crime out
yeah they don't they don't probably don't take a lot of refugees from other countries either
a lot of the higher the higher people were just stealing it and building these beautiful homes and nice ranches and things so we are we're suckers
they know they're not going to pay it back
you
did you go to mexico city anywhere near when the earthquake hit
oh i could imagine
oh really
yeah is there still blood stains on the altar or has it worn away all through the years
is it
do you get spooked you feel or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there because
i've had
three boys through
i guess some child care each one of them now they're in school so it's all over but
i guess i would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want
is that right
i guess
the only rule i can think of is that
i like to look for places with
good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that if they're associated with a college or a university they're usually pretty good bet
i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy car or refrigerator something you'd like to get it from some
good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care
i
yeah for profit places i would really look at them awfully carefully but
when i was
when my kids were young i was teaching at a university and the child care center associated with our university was quite good so i felt confident that they would do the right thing
if you're if there's a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another i guess that's true but
um-hum
i
yeah i never really worry very much about it i tend to think those are
very rare but quickly exploited and made public so i never really worried too much about that being
the case with my boys
i you know i think those things get
into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them but i don't think it's as common as the newspapers would make you believe
oh yeah i mean
that
right
well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were in school and i'm really happy we did it although it was very difficult and i think it was the right thing to do when we were
we
one or another of the boys in child care for part just for part of the day
or a couple of days a week just so that other things could get done around the house and so on so
so we did look around i think my wife
uh-huh
but i think you know you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for
how they treat the kids and what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them and i think
you have the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth and if they're at all queasy about that then
i'd look elsewhere yeah right
you have other friends that have kids being taken care of in child care
um-hum
so but i really think the news reports are tend to sensationalize the problems i think the problems are more ones of
really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
yeah
yeah
right
uh-huh
well
all right
i play volleyball and
softball and ceramics
i didn't think of working out as a hobby
or playing with the computer i do both at home
we've gotten a little atari computer husband describes it as a computer with training wheels
no i do ceramics i you know the pieces are made from a mold and i paint them
you know you get them you clean them up you know get the mold line off
you know you scrape that off and make it as smooth as possible
then you put it in a kiln and fire it you know it's like a big ogen oven
and when you pull it out it's called bisque it started it off with greenware
when you first start off and then it goes to bisque and that's when you can paint it
no i've
you can rent people's kiln they you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and pay them there's one woman that charge ten dollars a month for fire all that i wanted
the paints and stuff can get expensive the greenware it depends on what you buy
now i bought a chess set for my husband and painted it for him and i'd say the greenware for you know twenty four pieces i think is what they're no
thirty two pieces is a was cost me about eight dollars
no i liked it i had fun with it but you know i'm a little shaky when it comes to detail work so i couldn't get the fine pieces so you know i had to
get parts that had big spaces in them
couldn't do the fine -tailed fine detail on it
but you know i made my son his donald duck and you know the disney characters painted them for him in real bright colors
and he enjoyed them till he was about two and then he had fun throwing them and broke them
that was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them
yeah well i didn't get mad at the kid i got mad at my husband for giving them to him
i workout with that espn
the people on espn
i workout with them or try to
yeah well i don't work
so i do it in the mornings
i haven't worked out in quite awhile i play volleyball i guess that's good enough workout
yeah it's fun
at once a week sometimes we play two games a night you know consist of fifteen point game and you play two games and you know the best person that wins two games wins
and few times we've had a tie breaker so i played three games
and
then we'll get a half hour break or so and then i'll go and play another set with somebody else you know
it's fun
yeah well i've torn mine up you know we play with a church team so we're not competitive we're just having fun
and when i played softball it was with the church team it was just for fun although the church team we made it to the nationals we were ranked fifteenth in the nation so i you know i'm proud of that
but that was a for you know i was in another state then
so i'm not with the same softball team
but they're starting up soon so i'll be playing again
it's
it's a good way to get out with people and you don't have to
let's see what's the word
they have fun without doing
the drinking and all that
and you know you don't hear a lot of
angry words i'll you know be nice and you know it's going out to have fun
because it you know it's a it's a hobby you do not want to be stressed out after playing
um-hum
i've been trying to program some
disk or some what do you call them putting some programs into the on the disk
and i'll get to about fifteen sixteen lines and i'd mess up and it just says you have entered a error in line and i don't see how people do that drives me batty
yeah
having a program work on me was the atari toot
and you know that was just a couple lines and you push a button and you hear a train and then the toot
all right thank you bye-bye
okay so what kind of books do you like to read
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i prefer my favorite types of books are human interest type books biographies
it can be fiction about people i like books that are about people that have historical you know that tell you something about the history at the same time you know or a certain area so
by corrie ten boom yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i like i guess my preference is for christian biographies but i i'm interested in both you know because i you learn a lot from reading about people's lives and
yeah that's probably one of my all time favorites what would you say is your favorite book that you've ever read
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah are you uh-huh
uh-huh i remember a long time ago i read some books by glen bristol you ever read any
yeah those
i don't know why gone with the wind made me think of that but those are books that are like they some of them took place in
well there's one that took place in georgia and another that took place yeah they're historically based fiction so they're
yeah
uh-huh i don't think i am i don't think i am but go ahead yeah
oh yes uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah that's right i do sometimes but
for the most part i mean illustrations real examples you know instead of just giving me a sermon or giving me a you know how to type idea
yeah some real examples from their own life that proves that they know what they're talking about i just read one called the language of love
by gary smalley and someone else and that was really good yeah it's full of personal illustrations and illustrations of people they'd work with their psychologists
so what about you what do you like to read for self-improvement
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i guess i agree there
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah so uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah with humor in them those are
yeah
yeah those are good
oh
yeah i think it probably does well
yeah i have too though good-bye have a good evening thank you bye-bye
are you there okay now tell me your favorite team
yes
okay i think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they're headed
so we'll have to talk about the future with the rangers
what are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do
well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his
yes and the rangers go up a little bit um-hum
i think the entire baseball yeah they're the ones that probably are paying the highest
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous
no
that's right
what i saw on the news today that buechele was back just to visit
i'm awful sorry he's not still
oh i'm sure it was
pittsburgh yeah
yes sir
well what do you think of howse
who is the coach for the pitchers
yes
his assistant
um-hum
i really wish they could
see fit to get rid of howse
no i really don't
and i'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that but i'm not fond of howse and i'm not fond of grieves
yeah
well i'm just gullible enough that i think bobby valentine is doing all right
for these rangers to get their act together and give
i understand
well
-perience with
dealings in government are that i'm one of these three million dish owners in this country
and we've been fighting since about nineteen eighty six to try and get some legislation enacted against some of these cable companies and how they've been stumping on their competition and what little there is
and it's a very pro consumer type of legislation but we're constantly running into trouble trying to get it passed because we're up against huge pack money donations from the cable tv industry
in this country and i've come to learn that a lot of these politicians unless you can mobilize enough consumers
or voters to make a stink about an issue if there's a big pack check involved they'll take the check every single time
oh sure but i think it goes i you know a little of it obviously is they're getting themselves prepared for when they're out of office when they become consultants or high-powered lobbyists themselves
and i think that although some of the people that we have in elected office are upstanding honest people i think that as they're in the system from longer and longer
they get corrupted by it basically by losing touch with the people that they're supposed to be serving and i think they forget who it is they're supposed to be representing
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
sure
yeah that's that kind of you know i in a in it's gotten very pervasive
when it comes to expectations on the part of members of each of the party that you try not to cross party lines on certain votes especially these days
and the problem comes about when you have somebody who wants to vote for something the other party advocates strongly and
yeah well in some cases they do they vote their conscience and then of course you know they may be punished for not doing the appropriate thing that came down with the cable issue
because we had a republican senator john danforth who is strongly in support of it but then you had the white house strongly against it because it would reregulate to an extent
and they just wouldn't hear of it at all so we had trouble but he stood his ground
and carried with him a lot of you know people underneath him who are republicans but at the same point it causes a lot of strife and then people dig their heels in and
um-hum
yeah you have to be a real old timer and powerful to be able to do that especially when it's committee assignment handout time and
things like that
but a lot of women are as knowledgeable about pro football as i am
can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the steelers well i can understand that i you know i kind of like the cowboys too
they've had some great games in the past
uh-huh me too
it wasn't nearly as much fun when bradshaw was playing for you guys i'll tell you he lives in the dallas area now as a matter of fact
well actually it's probably closer to fort worth but it's in the same area he bought a big horse farm out in a little town called roanoke texas
but he pops up on the dallas scene quite often as a matter of fact there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job
i don't know he'd be good at it he's such a motivator he primarily you know with the quarterbacks that would be his specialty i wished i wished they could work something i really like him i really do
yeah okay i'd love to see dallas and houston play in a super bowl that would be really great
that may not ever happen i don't know houston has had some wonderful talent you know down through the years and in the earlier years they really had some super teams
that's right
he certainly is he's very good
he's very good
that's right randall cunningham was with philadelphia i guess last year but he's no longer with the team
so you're right there are very few black quarterbacks or at least that are starting anyway how do you think the steelers are going to do this year you have any idea
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah that was just that was just super team
yeah
well that's a tough it would be tough to do it really would they have such a super team for years
that won what four super bowls
four in a row i don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not
yeah
that's right and
that's right that's right
uh-huh yeah
he may have been the last of the old guard i don't know
um-hum yeah
they had such a super team
have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday
i see
there's quite a bit of activity now of course they had so many you know nice choices because their record was so lousy the last few years they picked up you know quiet a few
of the of course you never know the guys they pick you know may never play a game you never know it's a gamble it really is they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know
ever been
that was one of the toughest guys that i've ever seen in my life as far as you know dedication he just went all out every single play of course there have been some other great ones too dick butkis and bradshaw you know there's been so many
but if i had to pick one i would probably pick sam huff as a matter of fact
uh-huh
that's right
uh-huh
he is he is of course a quarterback has a big ego
they really they have to have they can't survive
they always think they can win you know which is the way it should be and boy he never gave up i'll tell you
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh absolutely i can't disagree with that they were super players they really were they really
uh-huh
yeah highlights yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
absolutely
absolutely
uh-huh go ahead
they take such a beating
absolutely i don't know how they do it it's it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know they're going to get hit it's just a matter of how hard you know or where
oh absolutely they look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem gosh what a beating they really do take a beating they really do
i think he was just probably a passing phenomena i think i don't know i i'm
knowing what you know of course mike ditka was in dallas for years and years as coach is knowing his or you know knowing of his temperament i'm just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around i really am he's such a he's about a half hot head anyway such a temper
uh-huh
that's right yeah absolutely there's just so much mass there i guess they just can't i don't know you know i probably the guy is you know is probably physically strong i you know obviously not very fast but i guess it's just
dallas has a guy his name is nate newton now he has a real weight problem too he fights it every single year but he manages to still keep playing but
he has a terrible weight problem
they the coaches watch him all year long they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not you know completely out of control
but i guess most every team has someone like that i don't know
absolutely they get bigger and bigger it seems every year i guess you have to
oh yeah sure well you'd have to or i would have to say you know someone like montana i guess who's done so well for so many years
yeah his age is about to catch up with him though
he's no spring chicken anymore and like you say warren moon's an excellent warren moon's an excellent but he's very exciting to watch uh-huh sure uh-huh absolutely
yeah he may uh-huh
yes he was i believe that's right at one point in time but he's a very young fellow yeah
uh-huh
that's right that's right yeah miami's had some down years too
but they all do i guess it's cyclical i guess as the players get older
get slower
yeah
oh yeah
oh yes very much so hip injuries and things like that yeah that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game
that's right uh-huh yeah i read some time well not too long ago that the average
professional career only lasts seven years so that's when you think about it that's really not a very long time of course
yeah but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years you know
that's right yeah that's right yeah
that's a pretty short career on average
of course they play their you know cards right and do some good investments they'll you know they'll do all right but a lot of them don't unfortunately
you know arrest record won't let able won't let them play anywhere else they seem to go to they seem to go to the raiders but that just may be you know perceived
you know perception i don't know al davis is he's a kind of strange character strange looking guy apparently he's
kind of a wild guy i don't really know for sure they've had some excellent teams though obviously they i'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play they keeping talk about you know going
okay
uh-huh
right yeah
that would be good
what'd you say
uh-huh
that's true
um-hum
well that's true the america's paying all this money to have other people give aid to other countries so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time
because actually when you when you do service overseas you end up learning something usually that's really useful plumbing or farming or something like that so you're really learning a skill
what'd you say
um-hum
yeah i think well that's probably the i don't know whether their idea is to be within the country or outside the country
yeah that would be neat yeah sort of like an exchange program uh-huh
yeah that'd be sort of neat
yeah well i like the idea of being a mandatory thing for welfare course that's what that's sort of like what truman had or was it roosevelt i can't remember with the big
yeah
uh-huh
getting people or the work program and all the all the make work jobs that was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building
what'd you say
lake what
caddo lake
oh okay real pretty like a swamp oh yeah oh okay yeah i been i got talked to someone else before that was a
a texan but i guess that's what we're going to have this is a ti experiment to see how talk texans talk to other people
virginia
oh yeah it is neat to get other people especially since you got other ideas about how people how people react to things and stuff
especially when it comes to social services i'm glad they have a lot of you know topics on social services
like this thing this is a pretty good idea i didn't even know they were thinking about it i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really thinking that it'd be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service
politician is pushing it or
or mitch snider
oh okay well see that's a dc thing mitch snider is the advocate for the homeless
yeah he started that and that was basically a you know donate time and money to help the homeless but
yeah
i'd have to basically say my birth yeah
cleaner ways of burning coal and people in the south would say don't burn coal you know
excuse me
how did i get into it oh i'm electrical engineer here in virginia
no
no they i'm in telecommunications company and they sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers want to participate you know
not really i mean no more than any other company you know we buy their parts just as much as anybody else
but no real association with ti other than being in the same industry
electronics industry
they just they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business with saying that you know if you're interested we're doing a study and
and since
i don't know no i don't
um-hum
right
oh i don't know
a little chip
oh yeah i didn't hear about that probably for ti employees yeah
oh you're not you don't work for texas instruments oh okay
oh
oh
oh that's a neat idea uh-huh
yeah well he's gotten a good mix i was saying because i've like i said i heard some other people talking they've talked to different people in different states and stuff
that's good especially since you call that one eight hundred number so probably knock ti's profits margin way down
yeah right this is probably some government study program
okay
okay well i enjoyed talking with you
i got to save my two year old from a pile of grapes she's diving into
okay we'll i'll talk to bye-bye
oh yes he's from dallas
yes
if do you think there's gonna be enough excitement that we'll have more people voting
yeah
well i don't know i think in terms of the national elections the election later this year since perot is from dallas and if he gets on the
ballot i think there that we will have the larger percentage of voter turnout than usual
but i think it's pathetic that only half of the people in the country that are eligible tend to vote in the national elections
i and i think it represents malaise due to well my vote doesn't count it doesn't matter anyway it's really i think it's more of a problem in the local elections
i it's too bad i you have more control over your local politicians
do you vote
yeah
that's not a part of your world
campus elections are more important i suppose
but there there's voter apathy there isn't there
isn't
yeah
participate a little more but
but also think about this if they're dumb enough to not vote do we really want them to vote
some of us i think do it out of habit
okay jay
could you tell me what your thoughts are about crime
oh so that's
what do you do work in plano
how far away is that from dallas from the city itself
oh so it
yeah that's the same with me well
i grew up in a rural area there's nothing but farms
and i still live in the same area it's built up somewhat and crime
really hasn't been a problem it's been
mostly outsiders coming in and you know robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing
radios and cassettes and things like that
not so much in the town i live in now but the closest large city in rhode island is providence and then it's boston which is about
oh forty five fifty miles away
which is really not that far
and providence is only like a dozen miles from where i am
and the next one up is a small city between me and providence
and that they're stealing handbags now in broad daylight they're taking the crime now the latest thing up here is
they'll somebody be driving along whether they're in their early twenty's or teens
and they'll steal jackets they'll holdup kids and they'll take their jackets and chains you know just get out of the car and
because they have got some of these like the leather jackets are quite expensive
yeah that's
yeah for a pair of tennis shoes
yeah no shoe is worth that price
you know not to not to go out and scuff up and
but
i don't know what the it's
it's probably the times now
i know you guys down there have had have had a problem for a while which we're experiencing now with the savings and loans and
yeah and rents are extremely high i mean people and they just don't care
you know it's either it's either you go out and you and you steal something or you bash somebody over the head
or you starve
yeah
yeah
we had we had an incident in our town not too far from where i live where
the police made a raid on and most of them were teenagers or
in their early twenties
which is unheard of in a small town
you know you don't usually associate that
but they did they made the raid you know and the whole town was upset
but i'm not so sure now if the drugs are really prevalent they're saying that alcohol now is one of the major contributors
like all of all the students now on campus i guess most of them drink or have binges on weekends and
and going to school
is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy
you know you either have to take a loan or most of them don't work or if they work they work part-time for
minimum wage yeah
yeah i'm not sure down there if you guys are all picking up but up here it's terrible
so you're still suffering then
as far as that goes
yeah
i was in dallas about twelve thirteen years ago and then i just went down again last month for a week
and it was it's like one huge city when i was flying in
it was just all lights
but you couldn't tell there was a problem
you know because it's so huge
part of the problem too i think up here is i mean
all the banking crisis all the white collar crimes stock brokers have been getting away with bloody murder the bankers have been getting away with bloody murder
nobody's being prosecuted
so
right what's
yeah what's the what's the poor guy going to do that's you know being threatened or thrown out on the street and he's got a family to support and he's got no job
i'm not sure how much of that is crime rather than just kids out there for a good time yeah
yeah because there's more and more there's more murders we had
just in southern massachusetts and rhode island over the weekend we had five murders
yeah i mean rhode island's just like a neighborhood compared to you guys down there it's just so small
and nobody even cares or nobody seems to care
yeah
yeah and if it's if it's drug related they turn the other way because that's one less problem that they have to put up with the law enforcement
and if they do come in i've got some friends on the police force and they say that you know they apprehend somebody and they bring them in and they let them out they're out on the street before they get their reports done
so there's no checks and balances
and i'm not sure what to do about that or which way it's going to go
yeah
they're being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean
the fire power against them now is atrocious
you know they've got
all kinds of automatic weapons these criminals do
and these poor guys out there trying to uphold the law
i don't know i kind of think they should bring back capital punishment
well
it's yeah
yeah for twenty or thirty years or forever there's no
yeah
and when i say there's no deterrent you know of the death penalty
that's like saying that
you don't put up any stoplights anymore because it's not a deterrent for people to stop at crossroads
so it just doesn't hold water and you look at some of the other countries that have the death penalty
and they don't have anywhere near the crime rate that we do of the violent crime rates that we do
you know give them due process and then and then let them
and then let them appeal yeah then you'd get yeah because some of it some of it's just down right
mean i mean they go out there just for the sake of harming somebody
and those are the people that you know can you rehabilitate them the some of the ones that are you know perpetual
yeah
yeah he can
because it's eventually it's going to it's going to swing back
it was
they had the death penalty way back and then it swung the other way and everybody's swore you know we're no better than they are if we if we put the death penalty in and
i guess looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty
mostly a mistake
on the other hand
the more i learn about the history the more i see it was
incremental decisions anyone of which was sort of understandable at the time
and but on the whole i think it probably was the wrong thing to do
how about you
um-hum
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
yes
yeah it's funny tonight i was
helping my kid with an essay on stalin
and i was thinking
in the course of talking to him about it how
in world war two the personalties of stalin hitler and churchill
more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was
they're certainly all leaders and with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them
otherwise there'd be they'd get you someplace else
i guess you can
i guess you can say that a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight
brought the cold war to an end but i don't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to call the bully out and beat him
but i
you know the like how they said the more i hear about it
the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable but the cumulative effect was to really get into a hopeless situation
where and as you say going halfway was probably worse than committing to a completely and winning it whatever that would mean
yeah
well you're not you're
it's ambivalent yeah
this desert storm stuff may have killed it but i think that was one of the biggest that you know the this domestic unrest that it
okay i'm here how do you feel about the public schools
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
well that's interesting i have a sister who used to live in kennesaw georgia
and she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there
and she complained quite a bit about this school system there
and
right
i'm only up here temporarily on an internship but i live in orlando florida usually
and the schools down there from what i know are not bad they're pretty good
but i know that in some i know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good
for example i have a brother in north carolina and he says the schools there are incredibly bad just terrible
hm
wow
that is slow
um-hum
what do you think's wrong to cause that
yeah
um-hum
yeah
perhaps
yeah
yeah
yeah that's one thing i worry about
there you go uh-huh
no
oh is that right
oh okay
yeah but you know it it's you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever but then again yeah there is no denying that
sure you know teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school
that's right you can't do that
right
see i grew up in nebraska
and the school that i went to there was fantastic it i really consider myself very lucky
we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty seven thirty kids to a class
but
yeah we zipped right along you know i was i was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily
yeah
right i was gonna ask you if there that was an option
the topic is how we can
how what is our
and how and do we have any ideas to encourage more recycling
well it is to me because
we're our particular little household is hot and heavy we have our glass bin our tin bin and our
papers that we accumulate and recycle and
plano texas
yes they certainly do they certainly do
where are you
oh i see
well our libraries and then the wal-mart stores have the bins in back of them and when you recycle glass
that seems to make a lot of difference and you have the colored glass and the clear glass and the paper and the tin cans
so when you get all of that going it is it occupies a space in your garage but you very quickly get use to it and we do not
sure well you know we haul it off once in a while and we also do not bag our clippings on our lawns we let the wind blow it off we do not fill
well this is texas it doesn't set it blows
give
lots of grass give it twenty four hours and the whole things gone there's no problem someone else is worrying about
and we have somebody else's but the problem that bothers me more you know i think the communities will do as good as they are supported by their local government you know
if there's if there's enough need and they have a responsive local city management
it will happen
what upsets me there was an article and i'm sorry i was reading a book at the same time it was on our texas beaches
and they are our texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest beaches in the united states
and it's not because of litter it's because of boats
the if you could think of the basin the texas gulf coast as a large swirling
vacuum things that are thrown from ships swirl in and swirl in to our beaches
and it kills some of our animals
there's a professor down there that has texas a and m has a nice size facility
at port aransas
and he's got all these collection of animals that he's frozen that were killed you know by plastic
it's horrible it's a gross collection
um-hum
yes whatever those nasty things are
that's right or they starve to death because they can't swallow
or drowned
yeah
terrific
well they showed one baby turtle that had been caught up in some plastic
and it starved to death it couldn't it couldn't swallow it was pitiful
well they're suppose to be working around that
uh-huh
oh really
sure so
trust us it's our nets everything's great go back sleep and don't worry
oh
oh that's just sickening
well and the other thing we have an endangered species turtle a ridley's turtle
that's on the texas gulf coast
and there's our shrimp nets are suppose to be turtle proof so the turtles can swim through
huge fight going on
i guess if my family were terribly hungry i wouldn't be as humanistic as i am because i don't have that problem
so it's really a hard issue to say what's right and what's not
oh this is
like they raise catfish now
well part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen work for so little money
we have a lot of vietnamese
fisher people
and they support their whole family on less than i'd had for lunch
anyway
and of course they don't have the money to make an investment like that
and it all goes back to the government spending enough money high enough priorities on things like that
that they it would have to be government owned or financed if not controlled
there because the financing simply isn't there
because it's one of those cottage industries that
the very poor keep going but can't do anything to change
sure
well and you know they could they could be terribly sorry they're killing the turtles you know
probably are probably are
well they may do it
whether they like it or not they may do it you know
well in my unreformed days i have had turtle soup in new orleans and i can tell you it's fabulous
but of course a boot would taste fabulous when they finish with it
so it's no telling what the turtle really taste like
well it maybe it wasn't you know who knows what i had but it was fabulous
great sure it is
charge fifteen keep moving
as long as it's french
oh dear well i don't have any my big solutions all go back to elect politicians that are more sensitive because i think we can't do it ourselves
you need clout
it'd be great but the problem with that is you have all of these little branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing
you know like the woman down the tip of texas that
calls her turtles and kisses everyone of them everyday she's terribly interested in her turtles she could care less about shrimp
and on she goes you just kind of think everybody's got such a splintered interest
yeah that's exactly it
and there's no way to make one group more interested or sensitive to the other group but they can be but they're not sensitive on the bottom line which means money
that's why i keep going back to the politicians that it has to have some focal spot
we need we need an environmental ralph nader type
which
gee
right
right
me i'm in the legal department and we do have a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues
and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that ti has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a
a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but after while it always seems that the oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such
but the new idea is to take everything up to sherman and we're gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants
from what i've heard that everything would be in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have
permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can let you know go into the air
oh okay
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
okay
um-hum
hm
hm
now is that place built or you're still in the makings of it
hm
um-hum
um-hum
right
well i know from some of the sites that we've had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad and you have to clean up and
you know the law now is a super fund and anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know damaged the ground or not
everybody has to contribute and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up that's you know mega bucks to
you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and
certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the sherman facility than just letting it go in the ground because eventually you know it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined dump area
it still only in time starts to leak out
yeah there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place leaked again
um-hum
um-hum
hm
um-hum
yeah
oh you were oh okay
yes
you too bye
why do you think we don't spend enough
we're faced with people that
who didn't choose a lifestyle
but there was not help for them
you know drinking from a water fountain will give you aids
using a restroom will give you aids
but at the same token i feel like heart disease cancer
multiple sclerosis
where do we put those in perspective to aids
no i don't and you know i'm like you i do not know
what the government is spending on aids
yes
right
yeah
well i'm in texas and we have a teacher that died from aids
yeah
well not my school district but it was in the state of texas and it was because of a transfusion and i think that got a lot more publicity because again it wasn't a minority group
and you know we're looking at a situation that hopefully can be controlled
it is frightening you know because it could be you or i and then what would we do we'd want help
yeah well my mother had a blood transfusion about four years ago and i was scared to even mention to her
that there was an emergency situation we couldn't give she couldn't give her blood we couldn't go down to give our blood for her
and you know there's always the possibility
no but the i agree with you
yeah and i think it's you know
we got a nice little valley here and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter
when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley
yeah
yeah definitely here in utah
up along the wasatch front along the
western side of the of these rocky mountains here where a lot of the big cities are salt lake and ogden and provo and logan's up in the valley a little bit further north
we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it's from cars
and
get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the wasatch front which match that of la a few years ago
it's not it's almost sad because when i grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys
huh
they're getting serious about things like mandatory well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties emissions
yeah they've actually started doing it down along the not in logan up here because we're doing a lot better we have a lot population's a lot lighter up here
yeah
yep they're eliminating that out here
they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun
where they're looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the
basically how much of what is coming out the exhaust kind of like a radar gun
and yes
yeah do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things sometimes they put a source light
and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually
and
like across the street they'll set up like a trap or something that add in some sense and they're also looking at
other
you know ways of monitoring this and because they found out something basically that
and a poorly tuned car can emit something it's an incredible amount it was like four hundred times as much
of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons
then a properly tuned car and the idea being that if you just tuned up
all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the
the pollution then
you know you'd it be one way to cut the pollution in half
uh-huh
yeah and they're
subject is gun control do you own any guns
yeah
yeah i know the sort
i'm not much into guns myself either i don't know i enjoy working with them from time to time but
personal opinion there's a whole lot of weapons available on the market that really shouldn't be available at all
yeah they've got
well very few of them it they do make some for bird hunting but still those aren't real high powered they're just you know small caliber with a long barrel on them
but no these and these assault weapons with
real short stock short barrels and
armor piercing ammunition
yeah
they sell them here at wal-mart
three different models of glock yeah
wal-mart sporting goods department here in town carries the glock
they haven't got the latest version but they've got them
something like seventeen rounds in a double wide clip
craziness like that
practically yeah
no i didn't
luby's
what's a luby's
oh wait yeah that's been several months ago
okay yeah i did hear about that
and they weren't the least bit sure what happened what set him off
oh see i hadn't heard anything about you know what the bulk of his victims were but
yeah
that's what he was using
was it a rifle or a pistol
no the other gun
okay no i hadn't i hadn't heard what it was he was carrying all i knew is he'd been in there shooting i hadn't heard any about what he was carrying
yeah i do know they have fast recovery
goodness
well they
yeah probably ought to be longer than that really
seven is probably as long as you can expect the law to require
yeah seven day wait waiting period and the check through the fbi files and
yeah
yeah
they ought to carry they ought anybody with a permit to carry a gun you ought to have a permit for any kind of gun you carry period
whether it's pistol or rifle or it doesn't matter and the permit
you ought a ought to be required to keep it in your billfold at all times whether you got your gun with you or not like a driver's license
yeah it's part of the problem with guns in general they got hundreds out there you know the only experience they got is the you know the last couple times they got about half looped and went out and the gun and went out in the woods and started blowing up bottles
every hunting season scares the stew out of me even just to drive by a section of woods bothers me a little bit because i know there's maniacs out there the first couple of days
yeah
hm later on in the season it gets to be less of a problem
well what's your favorite dish
yeah i understand that i like oriental cooking and pasta and i have the same problem
i don't know sort of dumb what kind of food would you have in a dinner party well depends on what kind of people you got coming over so we'll leave it at that
let me see what do you like to cook just everything or do you have specialties
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
and i run a little direct mail business on the side and i finally put together a cookbook
and i've got to
because it's all size about it's not it's not very big i mean it's like a hundred and five pages something like that
um-hum
well see what else can we talk about food
well hardly any at all anymore i've gotten together sort of like basic recipes
and once you have those you can add to them or take away from them and come up with all kinds of different dishes
i have several cookbooks betty crocker and new york times and a couple of japanese cookbooks a couple of chinese cookbooks i even got a filipino cookbook
they have a nice dish in there for a chicken dish i forgot the name of it
but it takes a special kind of sausage and you can only get it at filipino stores
yeah and it's a it's a strange sort of it's sort of like a pepperoni
but it's it has a much sharper flavor and it's
it's almost like it has red dye in it or something when you cook it bleeds and it colors the food
it's pretty interesting but it's a real good chicken dish it's sort of like a chicken potpie in a way you have a crust on top and all that
delicious though i love it
yeah
yeah
yeah
an idea yeah
that's the way i am i generally get there and
i have a have an idea of what i wanna do i don't really know how to get started so i look at something get me get me ah yeah well i'll add this to it and do this and turns out pretty good sometimes
yeah
yeah
well i mean i mean that's yeah that's the fun of cooking improvising
if you're gonna sit there and just follow a recipe that's no fun
you know a monkey can do that
no not this one she's dead to the world right now
oh well let's see i guess that's about it on food
all right good talking to you brad take care bye
i'll start up here in rochester or down here in rochester recently they put in a law for mandatory recycling
in our area which involves collecting newspapers and bottles and cans and
a recent new statute that they just put into effect requires us to open and sort every single piece of our junk mail
so it's been hectic it takes me a lot more time now to go through my mail
huh
hm
finish except for magazines they'll take magazines they'll take
so we've i actually what i did is i went out and i got a separate trash barrel where i put my recycled papers in and we don't have to separate out like for example a kraft envelope
you don't have to sort that from a sheet of typing paper
um-hum
well you know what happens what we hate is when the wind picks up everything blows everywhere because and people won't put things on top to hold the papers there
we have these stores up here that do the same thing as far as bottles and that if they're not washed out
well it is it's terrible because we have a chain store here wegman's and they'll only accept bottles from products that you've bought at their store
yeah because they won't well we don't sell this so you know we're not gonna take it
oh it's terrible we've just recently they've been they've been fighting more and more because they wanna they wanna have it so that we can give them all of our junk mail
in it because it's terrible i mean i normally i open just bring the mail bucket i get every day and just hold it over the trash can and just start shaking you know
so you know you don't fill out publisher's clearing house you know you got oh let's see now are these
yeah are these stamps recyclable and we have this book that tells you what is and what is not recyclable
yeah it's been it's been rough you know they they've been complaining because
so what kind of music do you like
yeah that's same here
do you
yeah
uh-huh yeah that's about that's about all i listen to is the classical stuff we have a we have a really good classical radio station here
it's gets no money from the state or the feds or anybody it's one hundred percent listener supported
and it's a twenty four hour station
yeah they get a lot of support here
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that's the good thing about them they do no advertising that's it's really nice just music
yeah i like pbs
pbs here you can't get it unless you have cable
and that really upsets me because i won't pay cable prices because there's it's useless having cable i think
it's far too expensive and they don't have anything on there
yeah exactly
i've almost given in a couple of times and gotten it every time i get one of those special offers in the mail but
i've avoided the temptation so far but i sure do miss pbs
because they have lots of good stuff masterpiece theatre and mystery and nature
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah i had cable before i came up here
and i miss some of it i mean we had pretty good cable where i was but i miss discovery channel and a&e and cnn
every once in a while
occasionally down in charlotte
yeah it it's pretty good
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah i been into boston a few times i was there last year during the fourth of july thing and went out to the
esplanade and listened to the boston pops and
they're good they're really
oh really
yeah i boston's okay i mean i wouldn't want to live there but it's a nice place to visit
yeah it's crowded i know that
it's murder driving in that place
yeah and i always get stuck in the in the afternoon traffic
um-hum
well i tell you the way people are driving nowadays i'm surprised we're not killing more people than we are
seems like drivers are getting worse and worse every year
human factors
that's well it's sort of difficult to explain it's
it's industrial engineering and you look at applications and things from the from the human factor standpoint how does it interface with the person using it
and
yeah it that's very similar
yeah very similar
specializing in the computer and you know interfacing with computers and software and all that kind of good stuff
yeah this is sort of the same sort of thing that's why it's it was the professor who brought this thing in he'd gone to a conference
down there and brought this thing up i yeah sure i'll do it
why not
hey if ti wants to give me five bucks a phone call that's okay
you have to talk to all kinds of neat people all over the place
um-hum
where's she at
yeah there's
yeah there's not too many not too many big ones around here
after you know after being used to places like boston and atlanta you come here and you know they people think charlotte is the big town you know
yeah
charlotte oh what about
quarter of a million
oh it's fairly good size i mean it's not it's not small but it's certainly small by atlanta standards
course everything's small compared to atlanta
yeah my brother and sister-in-law live there i like
yeah atlanta's a good city it really is you have to get used to that cotton picking traffic on two eighty five
but if you if you miss it at the right time of the day then you're okay
but it always seemed like when i was there i was always finishing i lived in duluth which is north of atlanta well not north it's more east
along i eighty five
and i would always be on the other end of two eighty five having to go all the way around two eighty five and then onto eighty five to go home and it was always at the end of the day
i never managed to plan my departure right
oh yeah
yeah it's scary
it's scary they rival even chicago on departure and arrival number of arrivals every day
yeah oh it's a busy it's a busy place and they have amazingly few accidents there
amazingly few
because i mean if you're flying anywhere down here you always go through atlanta you can't avoid it
it's the hub city
and god
um-hum yeah
yeah that's super it's getting even better too
yeah they just they never stop doing things to it
all kinds of good stuff go
yeah last well see i left there in eighty
eighty six
so it's been it's been five years for me
yeah it just doesn't stop
i mean it
yeah
yeah
yeah
sure
yeah exactly
couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to massachusetts but boy i'm glad i didn't
because it's really going downhill up there
well you know i was when the big boom was going on i was thinking well dukakis must be an absolute genius
and then i really think that all of that was just you know temporary growth and everything to make him look good for the presidential election
because it certainly wasn't sustained
well
yeah but on the other hand if it if it needed his personal intervention all the time then it wasn't a good system anyway
you know it should it should have been rolling right along without him
you know good a good chief executive would be able to sit back and not do anything
hopefully
no that's true and lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasn't looking
so
yeah well you can't
you can't trust legislators anyway
yeah we didn't talk too much about music but we had a good conversation
like companies or i mean
frivolously either
i mean we don't i don't we don't have anything on the computer that says oops we only have five dollars left to spend this week you know it's not that rigid
trying to decide well do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it breaks
you know and if we do what kind of car do we want to get and if we do we should we pay cash for it or try to get a low interest
you know interest rate
so we had direct deposit you know for our car payment anyway and when my car was paid off i never told them to
you know to stop taking that money out so they've still been putting in oh i don't remember how much my payments were two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars
and then my husband has done the same thing with his payments
so it's just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings
and i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are
well that's in our goals i guess for this first quarter is to examine our financial
standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i don't really see any benefit over
money markets i don't know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but
that
right
right
hello
hi my name is dolphene i live in texas
okay i work for ti do you also okay
oh okay
i believe that if i am in a position like when my mother
gets to a point where she needs special care that i'll be able to
just bring her into my home
and my father also and
or have someone go into their home you know and look after them
that way
um-hum
you right it's basically it's more how they feel about it because it's like they have feelt they feel like they're
the way my mother would put it like somebody had throwed them away you know
right
um-hum
um-hum
i used to work in one of the offices in a nursing home and i got to see a lot of the things that they did
and they had a lot of games
the people that are that are in there
are real you know very nice and friendly to everybody
and then there are others that are it's a just a job and they just you know wanna go in and do what they have to do and get out and go home
right
right
yeah
like in wheelchairs all day they'd just roll themselves around all over the place and
and they would emjoy enjoy themselves with activities and then you would see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group and they just
didn't like participate together with the others because they had some
they weren't really together with the rest of them when they got together for such activities
do you have annual family reunions or
um-hum
all local were they like all in dallas
oh
uh-huh
just from city to city then huh
um-hum
um-hum
do you go back
is it choice or just business or
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh and is your mother still living
oh so you go back and visit with her anyway wouldn't you i mean either way there was family reunion time or
or not
relatives right
um-hum
um-hum
right
the next generation uh-huh
why do you think that it's less close than it used to be
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
is that just family's lack of priority anymore maybe yes
that we get so involved in our work lives and
just
social lives and so forth that
uh-huh
right
it really makes an effort on to do this anymore right
right
do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group
on a regular basis not just christmas cards though
um-hum
right
right
and didn't get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the texas oklahoma area
and
that circulates and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top
and then that's the way it's kept in order and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion
you don't feel like i don't know anything about this person you've read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth so you are kind of half way acquainted that way
and that that's been a that's been a nice way of
keeping us all aware of each other i think
we tried to start that in my husband's family his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well let's start this letter
and
we're real glad we got together because since that time there were only like two of the one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left and the sister-in-law died and the sister is in a nursing home so
we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago
so what was the last car repair that you had done on your car
um-hum
the control module a mystery box huh
yeah
that's impressive he's able to do a job like that because that requires special tools
oh that's interesting
that that's great what
what kind of jobs would you folks repair refer to a garage
um-hum
wow
well the last thing that i had to have done to my car i wound up doing myself and that was tuning it up
and i had been having a problem where i would be driving along and i would notice this at night when i'd be sitting at a light i would see smoke in my
my headlights and then later on when you know i'd get out wherever i was going i would smell something had been burning
and i pretty much figured it was oil because i'd looked under the hood a couple of times and there was a lot more oil sort of floating around than you should have on a honda which i ironically have too
and it run real well real well and so anyway i had been thinking about it for a long time and discovered that
or i had decided that what had happened is there's a little piece of metal that sits there over the top of the valve train called the valve cover
and i decided that there must be something wrong with the gasket or perhaps the whole cover itself hadn't been tightened down well or whatever and so
when i was doing this tune up i decided it was time for me to explore
and sure enough that's what the problem was
and so i went out and i got a new gasket and slipped it in there
and on older cars up to i in fact i have no idea when they started doing this but on the older cars they used to make the gasket out of a cork like material and on this car they make it out of a rubber like material
so
yeah up to a certain point i used to do a lot more of it when i was younger than i do now
and i have to admit that when the weather starts to get cold there's just no fun like a busted knuckle i just i just can't even tell you the joy i get from that experience and
sure and my finances have always been a little precarious so sometimes repairing the car is a financial necessity
but it's the down side of that is that i very rarely always had the right tools and
i've
yeah exactly yeah it's a sort of a catch twenty two if you're well enough off to buy these exotic tools you need to do the work then you can generally have somebody else do it for you
so
well
it's funny i've owned a lot of different cars i started out with volkswagons and then
graduated to a honda and had that for a long time and then graduated to a volvo and then wound up with a honda again
have gotten to know the engines in each one of these sorts of vehicles and but i in the volkswagon business i went from you know owning a bug to owning one of their cars called a rabbit
and the and there was a completely different kind of engine in the rabbit but i actually rebuilt a volkswagon bug engine at one point and so i learned an awful lot about cars that way and
okay now we're supposed to talk about social activities right
uh-huh
i think well i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation i think your generation is what do i say
they're polite they have more respect for other people just in general i think and just towards
people and property and i guess they would be more conservative some of them i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes i agree with
uh-huh
well
well do you think that maybe i mean i've heard different you know like
like i know my mom and like other ladies they complain because they think that the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids
uh-huh
yeah
oh my gosh just a baby
oh my gosh
uh-huh
yeah
well as
well i think the education like our education has increased dramatically but then i think also that we're forgetting like basic things like we should know
like i think well in the morals and values of like my generation for the most for most people are totally different
from the morals and valleys values of like per se your generation but i think as we get older it gets to your you know what i mean i think
the kids now are i would say louder now until after they reach like twenty five and then i think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things
uh-huh yeah because i think we're given more now whereas you had to work for everything and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work and you know and they don't have any intent to go working until they have to
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i don't know because i know i don't watch while i'm up here at school i don't watch hardly any tv like thursday night i like to sit down and watch a few shows but other than that
all i mean there are even though there's a few up here we call them couch potatoes they love to sit in front of the tv i said but for the for the most part i will i will well i live in an all girls dorm but for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen and like twenty one
and there isn't really a lot of tv watching
yeah well they're either hitting the books or something else i don't know what but i know oh well i guess they have their crowds like during the soap operas you know like in between classes or something
but i can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the tv all day
uh-huh but then like i know this girl she's doing her student teaching or she's just working like within the school
and yesterday she was at the kindergarten and there's this little boy he like didn't want to do anything and he said i'm not doing this i don't like it and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand and pretend like he's playing nintendo
you know so
i don't know how i mean i never really watched that a lot of tv when i was younger but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much tv so i don't know
uh-huh
yeah well we watch a lot of i guess we watched a lot of tv in the winter time but in the summer like right now my mom well like she doesn't let us watch tv until like eight o'clock at night you know are like
well like my younger brothers and sisters at home like when it starts getting nice outside in the summer and everything she'll she makes us go outside even now when i go home for the summer she makes us go outside and we're allowed to come in and watch tv until it's dark because she doesn't like the tv herself
and if it was up to her we wouldn't have one so you know she feels that kids are too dependent on it also
what about in our work ethics
i
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh it was nice talking to you too
what kind of fishing do you enjoy
so you like fresh water
uh-huh
oh i see
well i was raised on the texas gulf coast in the summers and during the christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast
and so i thought fish came out of the ocean
and anything that was fresh water was muddy
so i didn't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties
so i had i had always been a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun
there's so many different ways to catch fish you know at night you can
go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that which isn't technically fishing but it's a lot of fun
so i grew up fishing
what area lakes do you like
oh i see
oh i think i know where
lake caddo or something like that
if it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places they hold tournaments there and everything
i would love to do that but they have snakes over there
and i'm not too
welcome around i don't i really don't want to share a boat with a snake
i just i don't see it
i just i don't i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something i'd make some quick arrangements
and i've heard so many stories about the snakes
you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish and things like that i'm just
i don't know what's the largest fish you ever caught
on a lake yeah on a on a lake that's not a bad size fish
i would be impressed i mean you know
i've never done that
i've seen it
and i have no problem going out in a boat
it's just so dreadfully expensive and there's just so many other ways you know when you live down there
it's not a treat
it's what you do every day you know
one of my favorite things
was we were forever catching crab and steaming them
you know out on the on the beach
and you know just pitching them out on
on
what am i trying to say newspaper
and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and that's it
and the other little creatures would take care of what was left
so going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do
no
no i live in dallas
i lived in dallas
we had a house in port aransas
it's a little fishing village that is
corpus
well
south padre is on down the bend
it's like if you drew a line from austin straight down it would be in that region
small island
oh okay
was it bad
oh i hate to hear that
huh-uh
no
you went to galveston
i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water
the what is it the flagship
is it still there
i like that place
i didn't realize that had happened for some reason
well of course being raised on the water i'd never swim in it
huh-uh swimming is for swimming
pool that's why they call them swimming pools
that's where you swim you do not swim in the ocean
no
i've seen what comes out of the ocean and i have no desire to share any space with anything like that
but really huge sharks are down there i mean
incredibly large sharks
some of the young
dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night
kind of kind of nothing i won't have anything to do with
how wonderful
how wonderful
maybe i'll be so lucky
okay i enjoyed talking to you
bye-bye
-kay do you live in a single family dwelling as they call it
okay what sort of house is it
-eah
yeah
garage is that an actual closed in garage or is that carport type of thing
okay
never actually be out of the house
yeah around here they tell you if it if the advertisement for houses for sale says garage
it could mean anything from a part of the house all closed in to a nice corrugated fiberglass roof kind of hanging in the middle of the yard somewhere
yeah
yeah
you're getting part of that
okay
um-hum yeah
what
there's areas that are so bad about flooding that they just don't cover them
huh
yeah
you come to think of it it's that way around here too i mean you know there there's nothing even vaguely resembling hills around here
which was real confusing when i first moved into this area because
well actually right now my wife and i are living campus housing
they're apartment buildings one and two and three bedroom places be like you know
like twenty five or thirty units per building and something like
twenty five thirty buildings
about half of them are
one bedroom places
there's a pretty good number of two bedroom places and then there's like fifteen or twenty three bedroom places
but oh they're not really too bad they're basically cinder block places
but
yeah graduated in what
physics
wow sounds like fun
i i've got a couple of physics classes facing me this summer so
yeah from what i've seen of it i mean you know there's a lot of things that kind of dabble in the edges of physics before you actually get into the class
yeah
yeah i remember a teacher in high school saying that he enjoyed physics because it improved his pool game
yeah
yeah
well
once we get out of school we're hoping to get into the mountains somewhere
probably out west
yeah more than likely the rainy side of the mountains somewhere
but originally i'm from west virginia in the appalachian mountains
so long since fell in love with living in the mountains but it'd probably be like a two story possibly even a three story if we build our own we might even get a little crazy and you know build into the side of a hill
and do the
well i think that people should be allowed to have them especially if they go hunting which my son goes hunting he goes deer hunting he goes duck hunting
he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old
and i just think that as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting with you know as far as just having handguns around to
to have them i don't believe that you should have handguns around
well no there's too many sports people out there that do these things
um-hum and i think if they want one they're going to get one you know
the bad guys are you know like i say if they want a gun they're going to find out or somehow to get one
well i agree with you on that because i know in fact i had bought my son a rifle like for a christmas present one time and for a rifle there's no waiting there wasn't anyhow now there might be now
but there wasn't anything for you know rifles and things like that i guess it was just handguns that there was a some kind of a waiting you know a two weeks while they checked you out or something
but most of these people that's got these guns that's going around you know robbing people and shooting people
um-hum
um-hum
i see now i know they were having a gun show about a month ago and i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show
there's no restriction though you don't have to wait or nothing then huh
yeah i was just curious you know because i know at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks and then they check you out then they call you up and you go pick it up
he's always had a like a i think his first little rifle we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old
but he's always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it he goes to the pistol range and the rifle range to shoot them he likes to go to that shotgun thing where you shoot at those
i don't know i think they should try to control it and everything you know but as far as just banning it completely there that's not going to happen
um-hum
yeah right
now i do believe though like in california if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has i think they're liable now for it
they can be you know put in jail and everything the whoever owned the gun
you know now when they have kids around you'd think that they would be locking them up or you know
um-hum
well they can get into almost anything anymore
huh yeah that's a big one
well i think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions somebody else made them do it
that's what i seem to see a lot of that no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices
it's rather sue these guys because they made a seat belt that didn't work right or
well that's what i think is a big one but
uh-huh
sure
yeah and another thing i think has changed quite a bit is
the roles that men and women play
that's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly
well both you know there's some great things that
have come about with more equality
but i think that also i don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that because i think that's bad for us
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i would agree with you ah
so
the home that we bought back in the early eighties
was typical tract home and we were
trying to find something that would get us into the housing market as it were thinking that someday we'd move on the economy however changed that a little bit and looks like we're going to be in this home for a while but it's not too bad
some of the things that we didn't think about
when we bought it turned out
worked out all right for us was we bought on a top of a hill
and some of our neighbors down the lower part get their yards flooded every once in a while doesn't get up into the house but it just makes a bit of a mess in the in the yard itself a little bit of debris and a little bit of runoff on the
on the grass area it's kind of hard to keep grass in certain areas and i'd never really thought about that but we're pretty much at the very top of this little hill and all the runoff from
from the concrete the shopping center near us and the alleyway all that goes down to our neighbors so that was a little thing that i'd never really considered and was fortunate that it worked out that way
another calamity i guess that befalls some purchasers that i didn't think about when i first purchased this house was
what can happen immediately behind you we are on the edge of a development that has a little retainer wall that separates us from the rest of the from a street and a little business area
and some friends of ours moved into a house and a couple of years later a shopping center built up behind them and it was a grocery store that had that stocked at night at about three am every night
they would run the trash compactor and it was so loud it would wake them up and they never got used to it and they finally had to move they just couldn't stand that noise
then oddly enough after that they it closed down now that grocery store isn't there and hasn't been there for about six years now so
it's kind of a bad thing to happen but we happen to have landed again in a very lucky spot there is a little business development behind us that's a bit of a little bank and a couple of dry cleaning things and
little strip shopping center but it's several houses down because the property that's the other side of our little wall is a triangle shape
and the wedge part of the triangle got too skinny to do anything more than put some grass and trees there there's not even a parking lot so it it's a nice two or three houses on either side of us is nice grass and trees and
and then across from that is a major four lane street and then across from that is
is the parks of the city that we live in has some soccer fields and some baseball fields and that completely goes on to the horizon so as far as we can look out over our little retaining wall is grass and trees and parks
and we really didn't
i mean that wasn't our consideration when we bought it was a complete blank lot they hadn't even built the house yet and we were new to the this whole process and all we knew is that it was a the cheapest house that this tract development sold
so it turned out to be pretty good and
dallas
yeah it's a nice area as it were about the only two things that didn't work out too well for us well one of them's nice in a way we're on the beginning of a corner we live on a on a
u shaped drive and we're the first house that they actually started turning
to make for a turn on a on a not a cul-de-sac but a turn on a ninety degree turn on the street which meant that we're not jammed right up against our neighbor's house
there's like twelve or fifteen feet on one side but on the other side there's over sixty feet before the next house because they set us back a little ways and they turned it sideways
so our houses begin to turn to make this turn as it were so we're real far away and we have a really large lot we have a bigger lot than all the rest of the ones down the street
but as it turned out we decided we learned that neither one of us really likes taking care of all that grass so it was a bit of a drawback but it'll probably make for a good selling point if we ever give it to someone that does like all that grass
and we did also end up in a in an area that we didn't we didn't realize when we bought it that the soil is that black clay and it
it tends to go to the extremes of being dry or being moist and it it's done a little bit of a foundation damage that most of these houses get no matter how much watering we do
so we have to contend with doors that sometimes the during the year don't
close just right and things of that nature
yeah that's true there are there is a little segment up near mckinney and up near
they said out near wylie there's some
some little areas where the soil is completely sandy and then it goes back into the black gumbo around it
but there are some housing developments that the guy that came out and inspected our damage was saying that there are some little pockets of neighborhoods that don't have these problems at all and had i only known you know maybe i'd have looked over there
what about your house
um-hum
hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
nothing you can do
that's right nothing you can do
yeah we've got
i don't know that we've done anything different to prevent ours from doing that but most of our neighbors have ended up replacing them buying some nice anderson windows or some
some name brand windows one neighbor went with whatever sears installs and they have the
different kind of window that the kind that you can tilt out either pane and raise or lower you know lower the top down or the bottom up or tilt it in both of them tilt in so you can clean them or and it's a real strange
mechanical beast but they haven't lost their seal yet so it's i guess there's a some quality in it
so
um-hum
hum
goodness
yeah that's
that'd be hard to hard to cover all the ones that go bad
it's true
goodness
yeah and it'd be nice to do it with all the same kind too
hum
and those held
that's interesting i didn't know they could do that
yeah that could be but once you get that moisture in there it
it can fog up and not go away quickly enough
you can go ahead
yeah
well i think
you know rapist or
just people who broke into a house nothing like that but i think if someone's killed someone then they deserve to die
no dallas
yeah
yeah
yeah i think i think it's kind of sad people who a guy can go out and
completely slaughter a family and there's always got to be one person saying that they should have a chance to live and that the person who did the murdering should have a chance to live and i just don't think that's right i think it just makes me
want the killer to go after that person's family just one person just to see so that person will see how the other family felt
just so that they'll they can understand all the pain that they're going through and you know then they wouldn't be saying well that killer has a life too because it's not true the as soon as the killer kills someone they should deserve to die their life is over too
well i don't know because there's always people who
like fathers who a daughter was raped and they went after the rapist
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
sure
um-hum
it really is
um-hum
i watch just about anything but not a lot of tv i mean i'll watch you know maybe a little while when i first get home in the evening
or that kind of thing you know and i like the 911 and unsolved mysteries and
um-hum
now i do like my husband is really crazy about evening shade that comes on monday evening
and i
um-hum and i've got to where every monday i rush around so i could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny
um-hum
well his favorite night's monday night so we've got to where we'll sit and watch it on monday night because that and then that oh i can't even think of the name of it
like i say i'm not
yeah and the one with the sergeant
that married the woman with the kids sergeant mcgillis
sergeant major dad
yeah that comes on right after the evening shade and then murphy brown and designing women
so we always he watches that and i kind of i watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others as i can
um-hum
yeah
well you can't hardly watch knots landing with the little kids around though
except they's probably are in bed by nine
did you get your pizza taken care of
well do you know i have picked up a show lately on saturday night that i've really liked and that's sisters have you watched that
it's really you know it's really pretty good i mean it's kind of like you know
soap opera i guess
but it's so far it i've watched it about three times now and it's really held my attention it's been pretty good some pretty good acting
now i watched brooklyn bridge this week for the first time but i haven't i did i like it
now i haven't seen i'll fly away yet
um-hum
it's nearly too late for tv that's the way i am i get in from work and i'm tired and i sit and watch for a few minutes then i have to get up and do dinner and everything
um-hum
yeah
that's us if we're home on the weekend we always watch videos so
and i don't just spend all my time and i my husband now he sits and watch tv constantly
i can be around here for hours by myself and never have it on
but there are some really good new shows that i have enjoyed and i'll have to watch that i'll fly away this week
yeah
i never get in time for any of those so
yeah
well it's nice talking with you
bye
they probably oh it's probably five to ten years that they've been
you know in existence and but they've done really fairly well for a new team they i think out of the last like eleven games they've won
won nine which is pretty good because a lot of them were on you know on the road and
i think as far as whichever division they're in they're rated either number one or number two so that's yeah that's fairly good and how about
yeah and how about yourself
oh
the dallas mavericks i that
oh
oh
oh has she
well how fun
she must really enjoy it
as professionals professional basketball teams
oh uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh
oh is it
oh
my word
oh wow
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh oh yeah it's hard to just for me to picture these little ones that basketball is pretty big to be thrown
you know up that high
uh-huh
oh
right uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
how old is he
uh-huh
oh he was he was he was in
great oh great
uh-huh
oh
well that's fun have you ever played basketball
that is i've just played it for fun i've never done anything you know organized or on a school team or anything but i think it's a real fun game
um-hum
oh
oh uh-huh right
right
right
um-hum
well you know all about them then well tell me about it
you didn't like the director yeah
uh-huh
oh boy i bet it did
my wife worked at a child care quite a few years ago and she liked it all right when her
oh i think she worked there about two years our
two or three years well we had small children at the time see so it worked out pretty good she'd be there with some of them and
and but the other one has used a day care for her children
and
and she has kids too and he's just a baby but he does enjoy though she has twins and they're two or three years older than him but they
but
yeah
well of course that's just the way they are
yeah
huh
well yeah but you got plenty of time to do that you sound pretty young
but so i don't have a whole lot of experience with day care centers myself now either
was it in dallas
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah uh-huh i thought it might have been something that the state required but that wouldn't
that wouldn't apply to that would it
uh-huh that didn't make sense
yeah
well and it those kind it probably didn't pay a whole lot either
so if it doesn't pay a whole lot it's hard to put up with a lot of
that mickey mouse stuff that's my other line but i no i'll just ignore it
and
yeah i have four grandchildren
you still there aren't you
i guess it was that thing hanging up she had him in one and was real happy with it and then got unhappy with it and then she moved him to another one and was just real happy with it it's in garland
so she had really i'd say she had pretty good experiences with them
oh yeah the one she the first one she quit they'd lost his medicine
sent it home with another kid and it made her mad but i mean that's you know you got fifty kids there i could see that happening
but you course you lose a fifty dollar bottle of medicine but it looks like
well it looks like they would've whoever took it home would've brought it back
but anyway it made her real mad that's why she left it but other than that i mean it you know they'd been real good too so i'd say she's had really you know real good experiences with them
nothing no horror stories or you know of course they're regulated pretty strictly by the state
and which is good
well i know that i have only like two or three favorite television shows
i think one of my favorite then is from the guy stephen is it brochco who does like la law uh-huh and he also did hillstreet blues i like those type of shows
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah me too i know they i think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the reruns in the middle of the season
and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff
oh and so you must watch a lot of disney or cartoons then
um-hum
right
oh that's true that's true well i noticed that my kids are older now they're getting close to the teenage years but they did we watched all of mister rogers and everything but even some of your cartoons can be very violent
and i think it was on i have to remember which channel but anyway we were watching that and it was talking about opera and they showed like what they thought an opera would be and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit
and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even for a small child
um-hum
right
that's right
that's right well i don't think cartoons portray that but like
yeah
yeah a cat has nine lives
um-hum
um-hum
yes yeah that's true that's a good show i used to watch dallas i don't i don't know where you're at
you know that's about how disinterested i had become
uh-huh
well uh-huh
yep
yep i know i know was it actually based on a book
oh but you were just talking about okay
okay
yeah right
that's true that's true
stay um-hum yeah in if you notice and if you notice on dallas they lost all the women
yes so the men mainly stayed but the women were the ones who left and i thought that was very interesting and wondered kind of wondered about that
but we also have the paid television channels the only thing i don't like about it especially with teenagers is that all the violence the sex the nudity and the curse words
you know and so i know they didn't pick up these curse words from me so they had to have picked them up from the t v
one nice thing though about the cable company we use they have
and that's about the only way that i can that i can do it because their natural curiosity you know to go towards that way and want yeah
um-hum
yeah
well it was nice talking to you
so what's things that you look for when you go out to dinner
um-hum
that sounds pretty
yeah
um-hum well we don't go out to dinner that much either we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that but
i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean you know
i've been to some that's been terrible you know you see cockroaches crawling around and
everything you know but i try to get one that's nice and clean and then i like to you know good food and good service
so
yeah right
so is there some nice places to go to eat in plano
um-hum
um-hum
that sounds beautiful
um-hum
anyhow we have only like one
restaurant that's kind of nice you know they have prime rib on weekends
and then they have a about six miles from here is called a little city called wesley
and they have a wesley hotel there that they serve food and the atmosphere there is really nice
so and then if we really want to you know something different then we go to modesto which is like twenty minutes away
do i have kids well i have a son but he's grown up
um-hum
yeah all the kids seem to love mcdonald's don't they you know
no i'm sure there isn't
um-hum
i know it's
yeah
yeah
um-hum
oh it's foggy and cold here
um-hum yeah it's
i came from iowa when i was sixteen
so i've lived out in california for a long time yeah i like it real well
we used to live in oakland so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there
you know but then i quit work and everything and i bought a house i had a condo in oakland so right in chinatown so we went to a lots of restaurants and chinese restaurants
and they were really good i really miss them
you know
no i really don't miss living there i just like to go in there and have a nice chinese dinner once in a while you know
but as far as missing living there no it's close enough if i wanted to go there to san francisco for dinner or something why you know
an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back but
have you ever been to california
oh really
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i guess
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
you wanna go first
okay one of the things they talked about was
did we do what do we think about a judge making the decision and i really don't agree with that
i think that the trial by jury is better
you know than having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible
i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time
you know what i mean
yeah
right
that's it
well i feel the other thing too they were saying you know what new ways could you could it you know change the system
i really think that we spend a lot of time going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean if you go to a trial by jury
and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt
you all these things i mean you know we've gone through this over and over again
and it can go on for ten twenty years i think this is a little ridiculous
i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers
i i'm serious and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today with plea bargaining
well
well i know that's what i'm saying but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up
in that regard i mean you know people who commit crimes that they i don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and i understand that the jails are full of people you know
and that they have to do something but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
you know what i'm saying we don't have well a lot of states don't have capital punishment
and
i think they should i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people and
you know all they they're caught dead to rights i just think that that's they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
yeah
uh-huh
i don't know what would you do to change it to make it better
oh yeah i don't agree with that at all
imagine the guilt that person would have i mean it burned out is there's no possible way that you could you know feel good about yourself if you had to do something like that day after day
no not really
well do you think people should have a trial if they're caught dead to rights like
i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you
in other words you're saying that we you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were
yeah
yeah
well it's i feel
uh-huh
oh that's pretty nice
yeah
right
yeah that's just about all i get is the evening news and the and the newspaper sometimes i wish the evening news was like an hour long instead of thirty minutes
but that would be nice to have you all is it an all news radio station
uh-huh
um-hum
i guess i never i never really tried that it probably is on the am i know it's not on fm
yeah
yeah
well it's probably picking up klbj that's a real famous
lady bird used to own it
you know
um-hum
um-hum
some subject yeah
well not bad that sounds pretty interesting
right
oh i guess dan rather i'll switch around i'm not really partial you know one like monday i might have one and tuesday i might have another one you know just to get a different view
yeah um-hum
yeah it's a little draggy
so it's pretty nice in that the newspaper here it's only you only have one newspaper and it's kind of biased
but it it's all right
yeah it's very conservative i would say it's very conservative but you know being it's only you don't have one in the evening and you don't have a choice
and you know i don't i don't like that but i have small newspaper community that's oh it's
just in this general area it serves maybe twenty thousand people and it's free and it's real nice
yeah i really like it you yeah it's like the small hometown newspaper you know you can put your kid's picture in there if they had a birthday or something like that you know or some
okay when they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank i thought gee i haven't taken anything back for a long time
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
right
um-hum
right just to get you by five years and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed we're a wasteful society for sure
right
yeah
right
right
oh really
oh wow
um-hum and it's just a pain to deal with
but i think too a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one
so
yeah my husband is really good at fixing things too so he'll usually be able to fix anything that's minor and
but it was interesting to i don't know if they're making them better or not i it's hard to say some i think they make more of their parts plastic which you know make things break easier but i think the technology's better
right
yeah
yeah that's true
all right
uh-huh
oh where do you go to college
where's that
oh okay
yes well do you know do you do gardening at home
oh my goodness
hm
yeah well i guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest
yeah i had a whole bunch of flowers and things well i don't have as many now we lived in the country for a long time and i had a whole bunch but
now i work and i live in the city so
that sort a kind of hung it up i have a few flowers but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that
and this year i decided that well my husband made a little garden
out there with the tomatoes and stuff in it but i decided that i don't like grass i don't like to have to have to pull grass
so i decided that i would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot
to go see how it worked
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
oh
i had never thought about that i could probably plant one and bring it in and just like i bring my plants in every year
that'd be neat well i got a patio and
and so but he said no he was going to plant in the earth you know like he always has because he's always had a garden out in the country
and i think he kind of misses it a little bit you know since we moved to the city but
i went ahead and planted one and mine looks better than his
it does and then i like you know what daylilies are
daylilies
uh-huh that bite you
no hum-um these look like a lily they look like a well they really look like an orchid
when they come out uh-huh that what they look like but they only bloom for one day
they'll you'll have a bud the evening before and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it opens it starts opening up and then when it gets dark it closes and that's it only blooms for one day
uh-huh
yeah but
they look like orchids is what they look like but they look like different color ones like i have yellow ones and i have red ones and i have purple ones and then they have like you know the real velvety looking stuff inside
it looks just like orchids in different colors that's what they look like
they are they're beautiful i had a friend when i lived out in the country and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year you know or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with
and i mean they were real expensive they were like well the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty two fifty for one bulb
so what she would do is she would plant them and they multiplied
and i mean i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen
so when we decided to move it was really funny because like i said i had a whole bunch of
different kind of things and so i kept saying well i want to take a few of these and i want to take these and i want to take these
yeah and we had a tree that was like seventeen foot tall or something like that and he said
no i am not taking the tree you know i mean every time we went outside he'd look at something that was humongous you know no we're not taking that
without you know really tearing up their place but just like you know the people that bought ours
they bought the place but i knew that they would you know if i left like one bulb of each one of them by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them
so you know it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something you know it would cover it right up
but i just couldn't see it you know going off and leaving everything like that
because this house i really liked it and everything but the yard was a lot to be desired oh there was nothing i mean these people we have one ugly pine tree
i mean and it is ugly
yeah i mean it was terrible so really the plants that i brought over and put out here are just about all i don't do any of the mowing or you know edging and all that my husband does all that stuff
but that's because i'm allergic to the grass
really now i like to go to the beach where the sand is because then it doesn't make me ill
like saint augustine i think is what we have and it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country
but out in the country i mean if i went outside while he was mowing the grass i was going to have a gigantic attack
but
oh yeah
really it must be the at
now that's i mean that's something that grows like a weed here
i mean it grows like a weed we have to allow extra room for those because you know i mean extra space between the rows and all
yes but i mean we usually get if we plant say one for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it
and i mean just pulling them as fast as you can we usually give them to everybody anybody that wants a cucumber can have it but we tried it too where you run it up a fence
and yeah we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other
and it i mean it was but they're so heavy you know they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down but
um-hum
yeah now if we have any like the birds will pick or something you know and some of the seeds drop have you ever had them just come up in different places from that
i know we do that too you know and at the first year because i was from the city when we got married and the first year that we planted i couldn't figure out i mean the well the first year after
i mean we planted them but the first year you know after we'd had a crop
all these little things like we had cucumbers coming up you know in the middle of our okra and i thought how did this get here i know i didn't put that seed there you know and it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just
deposited them for us
um-hum
um-hum
laurie okay
i'm supposed to ask you how do you make use of your credit cards and i'm supposed to compare those with my habits
yes
right
no i do not
uh-huh
oh okay
sure
well myself i always i'm a traveling person
and i'm out of town quite a bit so i use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lodging entertainment and for everything
so that's as far as using them outside that i'm not i don't use them too much but i don't think i think my wife is sort of like you she uses a credit card most of the time
so she does most of the shopping for our household so she'll use them more than i will
yes
but so it's me i'm always i'm the guy that always goes to like dillard's and i'll go in and charge something and i'll have to give them my driver's license they'll have to look up the number because i'm never carrying a credit card
but i do carry like my american express and my visa which i use for you know primarily work type things
oh is it really
i've had this for a couple weeks and i've been out of town so this is my first time to
to use it
so
no i was given this topic
yeah they give you they assign you a topic you call the eight hundred number have you tried it yet
okay when you call the eight hundred number they assign you a topic and
i'm not sure
a couple about two three minutes i think
but i really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards i one thing i've always tried to do is when i get my credit cards i always try to pay them off because i just sort of detest paying interest
and like years ago my wife and i got married
she was the one with a little better heel than i was because i had my credit cards i think up to the limit and i was giving everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that but
that was like thirty years ago so now it's a little different we i get a bill and i pay it the same day it comes in
or at least i try to and i just try to tell my kids how much
i hate paying interest so they should follow the same rule
oh you bet it's a
it's an absolute savings
you bet
that's very handy
well
i think that's all i have
nice to meet you and give it a try i think you'll enjoy it
okay thank you bye
oh okay
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
and you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five
right
that
uh-huh
it's hard to find anywhere there really going to learn something and then yeah you do have to pay you know if you the better the place the more you're going to pay
true very true if
um-hum
um-hum if i had any children i would i hope that i'll be in a position to stay home with my child because
i'm not real
especially today people i work in the news business and i just see different things all the time
and people are just crazy these days they're crazy
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
hum
i guess that's the best way you know to get recommendations from your friends or family members
um-hum
hum
um-hum
yeah i mean you have to be you have to be sure that these people
i mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them you know that they wouldn't let them drink something or
um-hum
um-hum
and you hear so much you know on the news about
child care places and also senior care facilities you know and you hear abuse yeah
and so you just you just don't know and you almost want to you know spend a couple of weeks with in class with your child just to see how it is or something
but
no i don't
huh-uh
no
i'm
no i'm only i'm twenty three
so i still have a little bit of time
it's just not in the cards for me right now i'm trying to get my career going
and
yeah
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
and you brought up a good point you know about learning you just don't want a babysitter you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their abc's or something you know get them
um-hum
um-hum
huh
yes
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
um-hum
did you take this same route with your other two children
okay
um-hum
i was wondering how
um-hum
um-hum
right
and it helps that he has older brothers you know just to have role models and things like that
um-hum
hum
um-hum
that's excellent
these days so
um-hum
um-hum
do they have any kind of program like at ti or wherever your wife works
some any kind of day care
hum because i know they're putting that into a lot of corporations now
right
so maybe that'll be an option for
but then i foresee that being just a babysitting
thing not much learning but
you know
kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work
hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
hum
do you think it would have been better for him to have
maybe one continuous teacher somebody to that he could
get attached to or is it better the other way with a lot of different
uh-huh
um-hum
right
hum
right um-hum
right
yeah each child is individual as for as learning and things
um-hum
right well it sounds good sounds like he's doing real well
um-hum well good
um-hum
um-hum
and they'll probably sit him in front of the television
you know while they do other things yeah
um-hum
yeah
well that's good that's good
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's great
right
that's probably what i'll try and look for whenever i do have my children i don't know when that will be but
you know just really look into it will it will take me a long time to find somewhere i'm sure
just because i just want to be i want to be so positive that you know my children are okay
as well as the other children in the center you know
um-hum
um-hum
exactly
um-hum
it's difficulties but it's a lot more difficulties these days because you have both parents working a lot of times and so you have to find day care whereas you know here
um-hum
um-hum
that's right
so child care's a necessity whereas years ago you know the husband basically worked and the wife basically stayed home
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
i think that has a lot to do with just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is breaking
you know the basic family is not there anymore
i think that plays a big part in a child's learning and you know what they can and cannot do in child care
i would think
well what do you think in terms of benefits
absolutely
well i have to agree with that you know i was thinking about importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for the system to find a respondent
and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone
when i was much younger it was
less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits but as i grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important
i think they have
a one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've begun the
coda plan it's
certainly a supplemental way and i suppose if maybe in your instance if you're started with ti in your
early to mid twenties and happen to stay with them until you're sixty five then you'll have a very good retirement plan
but i
had another career first and then came to ti a little later
so it's not all by itself it won't be adequate for my situation
so i have to find a way to supplement that
i understand though it believe me i do that myself and i disagree with you i don't think it's the worst investment in the world
well it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed until later
it's shown a history that sure beats anything else
over many years
except that mine are a little bit older and i've shown them the numbers and said
this is what's going to be available all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there you better make sure that you've got a scholarship
i know and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them
i have a an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee dad i want to be an allergist and i said that's wonderful i applaud that let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
and then her little brother's only two years behind and he says well i don't know i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said that's great let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
well that's fantastic and on whole i would say that they're
equal to most of our competitors
i can see some potential changes that
probably are would not cost very much but
might make things a little easier such as offering a smorgasbord
having a larger variety of benefits but here's the amount that ti is going to pay for it now it's up to you it's menu selection so to speak
well i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime
and i don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that
and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one
as a repayment for every three to five days that i work overtime there they should give me one day
but it should be a standard and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate that's running in each department
well that's for sure
oh i'm sure personalities always come into play just in this size of organization
i don't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in we live in the saginaw area
um-hum and i'm not real familiar with anything that i fact the far as i know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here and or the grocery story or anything in this area yeah
uh-huh
really
that is pretty good i'm we're originally from another state and i know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing the city brought out
you know separate trash cans and you separated your stuff and you put it in there and they took it you know
i don't really know i don't really know they started after we moved down here and so i i'm not really familiar i just know that and my in-laws up in up in oklahoma that's how they do you know they pick it up but i don't know if they get a
get anything back on it or do you get money for it
oh
really
right
yeah i think now they're a lot more expensive than that
i bought some cokes the other day in the little bottles
you know and i think the bottles were like
i know they were at least ten cents apiece i was trying to figure out how i was like god how much were those bottles you know and it was they come in like eight and eight and ten packs you know
instead of six packs and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles you know i was like god almighty costs more for the bottles than it did for the cokes
we're gonna bump our heads what a job
right
oh really
of green glass
out in this area they really don't have anything now i know that like minyard's
and places like that around like arlington and fort worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front
yeah different colors for different things and
and things like that but i did know some of these places were doing that and they discontinued them because people coming and dumping their trash in them
yeah
yeah
more than it's worth
right well who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away
it was nice talking to you i have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything
is that it okay well it was nice talking to you and i guess i'll do this for i was doing this actually i was gonna do it for my son
so that he could he he's in high school so that he could make some money
oh are you
oh that's interesting that's nice well thank you good-bye
yeah what do
oh you go skiing eh
yeah well out here in the west you've got some nice places to go skiing
anyway
i haven't been in a regular exercising program do you have a regular program that you actually you know stick to or
do you have it planned out or is
it just you do exercise for recreation
um-hum
so you go
so you like regularly do volleyball yeah i used to i used to regularly run and then about a year and a half ago i had some back problems
and i haven't been able to get out and run and i have really noticed it in a year and a half i've gone from being fit to being
a vegetable i feel like such a vegetable now
but
yeah i'm over twenty i'm
going down the gentle slope
yeah
yeah so anyway i'm looking forward to the spring as it comes around to trying to get back into running now that i'm
no
no i've never had problems with my knees at all
the
that's not at all a problem it's more just
the other thing i do is i run with my wife and so we go kind of out together
and we don't run hard like we jog and like kind of just go see places and kind of
run around together and it's not like we go real hard or anything but it's enjoyable
oh yeah well you do i mean it's really jogging but i mean you can push yourself at different levels how hard you run
hm
it's not really stressful at all in any i mean it's fun and it's enjoyable and it's good exercise but
you do you run
how about swimming for a while i used to swim
uh-huh
does this extend out from like high school or something like that
athletics or anything that you used to do in high school
i used to run some cross country in high school but
uh-huh
all right how do you feel about the health insurance problems
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
wow
oh my god what a terrible thing for her to go through
ah
yeah
well no i had never had experiences like you did which sound terrible to go through
um-hum
uh-huh
right
right
uh-huh
oh
ah
that doesn't give any incentive
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
i guess so
i just joined an hmo i just got a new job and i haven't heard i haven't been i haven't even actually paid for it or actually started my coverage yet but that's what they have is hmo and
um-hum
well what they told me at work they told me that
they said that the most once you get to know the doctors well you get you get your choice of doctors but there's huge waiting lines for the good ones and there's no waiting lines for the bad ones so you don't really get the good ones even if you choose them you don't get them for years and years if at all
so
yeah
how would they decide who get's which doctor
oh i see local
right that the same for the hmo and because the doctors work for the hmo the people i work with are telling me you know hmo's are great if you're generally healthy
how bad is it do you have smog like they do in california
uh-huh
hm depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take yeah
um-hum
what do you think is your primary cause of it
you do you really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas
um-hum
hm my goodness
um-hum
i think a lot of it's industrial i also think that there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but it's mostly from older automobiles i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting frankly i think that
i think that
if i heard a story a while back something effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off of the road that have been
manufactured say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining
yeah from cars that is not total but just from cars okay
so that i think would be a tremendous help and i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical and it just keeps getting
gives me good service and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have
but i don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies and that may be part of the problem
yeah
yeah oh yeah it's pretty heavy up here i think but i think it's mostly industrial is what i really believe is the main problem and
and
and people i don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should i we seem to have a high cancer rate up here in maryland
yeah and
well for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant and i think of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody
but this state was like second my wife's a registered nurse and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of cancer rate
for just all kinds and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is but i just can't believe this now we have a lot of pollution being caused by fluorocarbons
which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty two they use freon twenty two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer
and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also and having all kinds of effects
well they're working now i know dupont and dow and several other chemical companies are working feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons and whoever does is gonna make a mint because if they ever come up with a reasonable
working agent in place of fluorocarbons then
well they used to be but they made them take it out of that
right
no they passed a law and made them take fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers
and that was a move in the right direction we are doing some things to try to correct the problem but there are more things we could do and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem
just trying to i think be careful with the way you handle garbage i notice in this state i don't know if you're doing it in texas yet or not but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces
you know containers in yeah
yeah well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too but they in one of the counties here they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police
they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid and she spot checks people's trash and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash they'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time
yeah you right you got to give people incentives and surprisingly enough just handling of trash can cut pollution
from just throwing it in a dump or whatever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it they've stopped that up here too
but that will cut pollution too because you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think decaying and trying to for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all
well on the other had i don't guess they're polluting but plastic containers and the like they may be
ah i'm not sure of that
oh i think that's very important to do i really think that trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very important thing and that can help to cut pollution i guess some i don't know how much
trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air i would hope that they would help some though that's for sure
um-hum
um-hum
oh good
well that i think may go on a lot
and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late night or something i don't think we have a adequate policing
particularly on industry
we have good policing at least in this state and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants because we have to go down once a year here in maryland and get our car's exhaust systems checked for emissions content
um-hum
no we don't have a state inspection but anytime you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state
i don't know that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities but in this state we have to pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year
and get everyone of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventy three
no we don't have inspections like that now i'm in maryland in virginia they check that every two years i think
and i think that's a good idea too not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily but i think it's a good idea the emissions check though is required in maryland and it's also required in virginia
a sister state to this and that's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants
um-hum well if they don't i would imagine in time they'll get along with they'll get around to it and if they don't then that's something i would certainly suggest you'd be willing to be for in terms of yeah
oh yeah i agree now that's another area we hadn't even discussed and that is water pollution and various of the other types of
of like food pollution i mean you hardly ever hear anybody say anything about food pollution but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this country so
hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of pollutants in our food but water pollution
i've worried especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like i know a lot more people are going to bottled water
um-hum
yeah
i'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked because it seems when i was a kid growing up down south i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were and we had a well with one of those draws that
i forget what you call those things and that was some of the best tasting water i mean i can still to this day taste that water
yeah
uh-huh
huh
oh i bet it was yeah once it's been filtered and if it's a deep enough well filtered through all the earth and everything i think that it depends of course where you are a good well though i think is very healthy
right
probably find someone how come you wouldn't take them to a day care just because of the
yeah they seem to pass a lot a
yeah you kind of wonder whether or not
i took cammy to a
and
well
i think they had a
so that was probably my own fault
that she didn't oh you know one thing i noticed is
just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name
and i didn't notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she'd bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural form
yes and i was kind of mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or
or tried to say look you're holding your she's holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff but she was
yes
and i hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point she was four
or three yeah she was it was last year
and then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on and i like i said i didn't notice it till then
because i hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and
stuff like that
no they never
i felt she needed the
um-hum
oh yeah i think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know
preschool's a different thing but i think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know and or unless you have awfully good references
reliable
people i don't know it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long
it is the older ones it's not you don't even really have any
real worries because you know that they'll play with whoever's there and they usually adapt pretty well
but
well and you know their kind of their schedules and you know if they're upset and
that type of a deal
i don't know how people that have young kids work and work full time and
and do it really without being stressed out all the time i think it's
well i don't know
then on the other hand i think it's harder to stay home in some regards
it's hard to
always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive and
at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess and you haven't got anything done and what am i gonna fix for supper
yeah it's kind of hard to always feel like gosh what is this important what i'm doing and
no it
but i think that taking kids to a probably people that take them to preschools and day cares full time
probably just feel a different
i think i just think it would be hard to do that full time i feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that are they driving the babysitter crazy and
you know
right well so what is your favorite tv show
oh you like that one
and you know there's so there's only a few that i that i like to watch routinely
oh well i like shows like growing pains and what's the other one now they moved from tuesday night to wednesday night so i don't get to watch it very much
wonder years yeah that's my favorite
yeah wonder years i guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when i was growing up or whatever i guess i can really relate to it and it's just a real cute show
uh-huh yeah
right
uh-huh yeah my wife really likes that show
uh-huh
yeah
yeah well there was but there's a sense of i guess purity in the show like one of my favorite shows used to be happy days but
you know richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure i guess and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it and i never did like it after that
so i don't know i say see the same thing in like wonder years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere
yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
so you're gonna watch a game tonight
so do you do you have a favorite for the series or anything
oh uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh yeah i live in garland and yeah i like steve bushel but i don't really like the pirates i'm a big saint louis cardinals fan so i'm kind of i'm kind of pulling for the braves over all they you know they
yeah one year then maybe they'll make it i don't know
i guess my favorite shows are the and you know the getting back to a point that you made that's really true we are watching roseanne i guess couple of weeks ago and
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah well that seems to be more our values too like the wonder years i mean
it's kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers you know or and you can kind of relate to it you know i don't know that's i enjoy that a lot
but you know i agree with you the and it's funny because the shows
like a lot of them that used to be considered risque like three's company and stuff i think they maintained people would watch them because there was that
you know there was really the period that was going on there i mean he really wasn't messing around with the girls but everybody perceived him that way and stuff
but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died
and it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way
because discuss crime in america and what we might be do to help stop it
oh yeah well actually i live in houston i'm in miami on business
but i've been down here quite a bit for the past oh six months on and off
and i know there's plenty of crime in dallas too
yeah
yeah i have i was talking with some with a friend of mine not too damned long ago and i'll tell you it it's you know i don't expect this would ever happen in the united states but i'm almost of the opinion
that the only way that a change is going to come about is if we really put some teeth into the law and make it such that the punishment fits the crime and
have a swift and sure justice that you know do away with some of these automatic appeals when i think that guilt is proven
well in houston it's absurd they are letting people that have been convicted three times for armed robbery
for example and this was they had a big article in the houston newspaper about it
because of the overcrowding they're being released from huntsville they're given two hundred dollars and put on a bus for houston with instructions to turn themselves in to a parole officer
less than twenty percent or ten percent it was a ridiculously low number actually do ever report to a parole officer
and the vast majority of them are then caught again go through the courts back to jail well it's ludicrous and absurd
a fraction sometimes you know a quarter of their sentence
but i don't know it's i don't own a gun
you know if you so often i mean it's having a gun leads to tragedy
and at the same and at the same time
i think i have thought before what would i do if i were accosted
you know
a fellow i work with in houston he told me just this past week his wife was walking out of a mall ten o'clock in the morning in houston and was robbed
broad open daylight in the parking lot
so anyway it is it's a scary situation and i really don't know what this what the answer
in their jail cells it's absurd
yeah so i mean i don't know
yeah i don't know it's yeah
well on this subject of invasion of privacy yes it's very easy for anybody to find out about you
your
yeah the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast i think last week or so ago it detailed how this one person went about
finding out this particular from this particular person his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are
his social security number driver's license any kind of records he may have their credit card and the status of their credit
it was just as a demonstration to show
those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person
and it was mostly it dealt with marketing companies these direct marketing
associations that was the primary subject that's how they obtain information about segments of society
and group them into age brackets their habits their hobbies their income
and they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer
um-hum
the open office
yeah
not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i suppose because it you can easily be overheard
and they get i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen
yeah there's there is
um-hum
um-hum
do you work with mixed company male and female or
well there are a few out there
it's i suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at
but
my own environment is open totally there are no cubicles
there's nothing to block anything
so yeah but i guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of
communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record or
the computer is the
the big advent of that i believe because it they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button and it appears
in front of them and you don't have to i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families
that's no secret and it shouldn't be that way i don't think
i mean it's not really government for the people and by the people i'll tell you that
so
the only way it can change is
if everybody bands together it's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office
the only thing really that can be changed is for us to everybody to say we've had enough of you out you go but
i don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done
i don't know it's still a free i suppose country insofar as we're able to
obtain information and i wouldn't be for total banning of
all information or it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about but it's hard to define
a lot of those boundaries
uh-huh
uh-huh
so you've received a lot of flack
um-hum
um-hum
is that usually what you tell them in the letter
um-hum
um-hum
good idea
um-hum
oh that's good
any other problems
i guess i've just about run out of
it's i'm clouding up right now
well it's nice talking to you
maybe again
bye-bye
yeah they've sort of left a bad taste in my mouth too i've been sort of
irresponsible a couple of years ago and i'm still paying for the my own stupidity
uh-huh
oh you're
uh-huh
if the other person doesn't
yeah
oh i'd say so and isn't it now on those cards was it
mostly her that ran up the bills yeah
twenty thousand
wholly smokes
yeah that's got to be like
close to
what a thousand bucks a month
uh-huh
right
yeah you might be worth your while to
run one of them
thirty dollar
credit checks just to
find out what it says
yeah
i need to find i need my credit card mostly for just government travel you know
program manager for the air force and
i have to go on
travel quite a bit to contractors facilities and when i do i have to have the hotel and all that kind of stuff but i've been trying to
curtail my use of it to nothing with the exception of
of them those type things
yeah
no i'm not
uh-huh
yeah
oh gee
right
sounds like it so the credit card was inactive
when you
right
right
oh my gosh
yeah
guess the bottom line is
you got to be
darn sure you're marrying the right person when you
when you do that too but
i guess a divorce in any
circumstance doesn't normally they're
sir
yeah
that's for sure i know i happen to know of a different guy who a girl i used to date her brother his wife ran up
thousands of dollars in credit well i guess they're they are both responsible for the stupid things but
had a similar situation and then
it was almost like he couldn't get a divorce
because
i guess she didn't even work or anything and then he would've been
strapped with everything
i
uh-huh
yeah
well
i know i'm
about
thinking about doing a getting a consolidation loan just to
lump everything together so that and it's down to one payment and then just get rid of all these old accounts and just work on a cash only
system because i'm just i am sort of irked at this
at these credit card companies and
you know they got you
and
right
no
right
right
yeah
yeah i remember
was it two years ago or they did away with it last year right
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well remember my
refund on my income tax was a lot bigger
two years ago than it was this year
that's for sure
right
right
i
i can't even declare that here in my situation because it's
not until i sell it
the way it works for me because i own it as
jointly with my father
and
the
classified as a regular family dwelling so there's some reason we can't
declare any mortgage interest
do you mean do we do i live in it or
what
what does that mean
oh and
well that would be an interesting situation because i'm a resident of pennsylvania and because i'm in the air force and i'm living here in new york so i can't even vote here
so
yeah
resident of pennsylvania is because they don't charge military income tax
so and so it's like texas doesn't either
yeah or
yeah
uh-huh
right
huh
sure
well
i don't know
just
getting back to the subject of credit cards i think the best
thing
maybe is that even though the american express charges the annual fee is the american express card is it makes you pay it every month
yeah
yeah i've got a diner's club through the government as well yeah they
they force us to have yeah
government diner's club and i had an american express of my own i probably if i was smart i'd get rid of the american express and get
stop paying that annual fee on it but
ooh
yeah
that that's not good
yeah oh jeez
really
no
right
yeah it's like going oh i'll have that money by the end of the month and then end of the month comes around and you get your insurance bill comes and
yeah i know that feeling
yeah oh well i'm getting to just about to that point myself so
oh really i haven't i we've actually haven't timed any of them i just kind of go into conversation
ends on it's own or that they do come in with that so well anyway it was nice
yeah it's nice talking to you jerry and
no you go right ahead because i have a lot of strong opinions on it too my wife teaches seventh grade
there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system i think the i don't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly but
plano school system but to give you an example
you know one of her kids will come in and he's
you could tell he's just bombed out on drugs and she sends him to the principal's office and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem you take care of it
you're not allowed to send them home you know if you do that then
your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever your you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day and just it's a numbers game i don't think that's right if they're especially if they're interrupting the class and
preventing other kids from learning
yes
sure
sure
oh yeah my son had such a tough time in
the school he went to but there was through it wasn't all the school's fault it was his fault also but we put him in a private school in richardson and that cost more that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters that was more than his college tuition was
but had to be done at least it
took care of him and threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and want to learn something
but i'll tell you what there's a there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today
yeah i think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate
you bet
you bet
it's
sure well teachers you know they have a tough row to hoe so to speak they just
are always fighting the system i don't know if it's better than any you know we came down to texas from the new york area we were only there for a short time but my wife is from new york and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything and
i think you know the schools in the east are really a lot better than the schools in the south i don't care where you're from and they i don't know if they learn more but they certainly
they have a tendency to learn more and in that part of the country there is all nationalities
did you hear the topic carol
right
oh well good i feel the same way just the last few years things i've purchased have been
you know pretty good quality and worn well as far as clothes or have driven well as far as cars and sort of have lasted
you know for a good part
yes
oh
pardon me
oh a little bit
no i just bought one of those little handy dandy singer sewing machines my wife you know when you're using you're the little small one that fit in your hands
i purchased one of those the only complaint i might have there is it takes so long to get the item
you bet yeah a lot of times i'll do the same thing one thing that happened recently is about three weeks ago i bought a new pair of glasses and
two days after i bought them i picked them up and i went back two days later which is four days after i purchased them to
get them adjusted and i noticed they were running a thirty to sixty off sale so i paid the higher price so i did you know ask for a little interview with the manager and he came over
he granted me a few free goods you know to make up the difference
which i thought was fair
sure
but overall i think i'm
no
right
any trouble getting it back
sure
i try to buy most of my clothing from like the bigger guys the dealers of the world people like that because they don't have any trouble returning goods they purchase so much from these manufacturers you know they can return anything
so you're just generally speaking you never have a problem taking something back to them because it didn't wear properly or it came apart or something
you bet
you bet
oh absolutely
yeah mail order the same thing i buy a few things from kebelsk
i bought a lincoln
up with the exception of someone hitting me and me tearing it up a little bit
it's been a very nice car about a ninety one it's about a year old now
no not really you know it's like the old saying they don't build things like they used to and i really believe that in some situations but in probably in cars that's very true
but they don't build them like they used to but
there okay had to mess with my phone here do you have children
okay
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh no kidding
really
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum because there's
yeah
it's like a family thing
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh gosh
right
wasn't the same uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
was it yeah
good
oh good that's great that's good well i got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years my oldest one is ten and a half now
or she's i guess yeah it's was about ten years so i yeah i was i was really happy that i was able to do that but i that's what i wanted to because i
to go back to work and my youngest was only two and a half i mean she was already two and a half so it wasn't you know she wasn't an infant
yeah so i felt real good about that but boy i tell you with summer coming up i'm just pulling my hair out in terms of what i'm going to do i guess i went back to work about a year and a half ago
and i worked full time all last year and now i'm going to school part time and graduate school and i'm working part time and so i'm still yeah i'm still going full time but i only have half time salary
and when school lets out i just don't i haven't i have no idea what i'm going to do because i certainly can't afford what we did last year
which was
well we did we tried we had all different things we sent them to camp one first month in june they went to summer school then the second month they
one my daughter went home to visit my mom for a while and my son went to camp and there we had i don't know some
forget what else we did but it was all really expensive
so now they're a year older and i my daughter's eleven going to be eleven this summer and my son will be nine and a half
and so i'm not i think i can leave them home for a if i can work part of the day you know i'm going to leave them home right
you know that's okay but the four year old now i have i have had her since i went back to work or before i went back to work really in a home day care
situation and we've just been really thrilled with it too we were actually we it took us two or three different people to find
yeah right but i wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know so the person we found it through the there's an association here in town of professional home care providers or something like that in plano
yeah and they have a number you can call and all these people are registered with their association and you know go like our
i don't want to call her a baby sitter she's doesn't like to be called that
care provider
right she goes to seminars and she gets home visitations by this i don't know state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they
have weekly meetings and everything and so it's just really well regulated
and she's just great in fact she's all upset because galen is going to go to
eight at the time just barely eight and we put him in amrein's day care after
afterward
well that's why we picked it because they were supposed to be real great and you know i think they were fine but the thing is he was in school all day
in the same area with no walls and
and then he'd get on the amrein's bus to go to amrein's
and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room you know and you know what having fun they had with these computer games and then they'd go outside for awhile they had snacks and story time and everything but it was just like going to school until five thirty at night
yes
yeah
right that's exactly it so another thing that we tried to do i know your son's too young right now but we're trying we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and stuff like that and
yeah
right yeah
it is
it is and
yeah
i bet yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right
oh my gosh you are kidding
you're kidding oh that's great
well good for him
uh-huh yeah
well that's great that's so good
uh-huh
he's out of there
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah good
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my gosh
no kidding
she knows something right that she if
yeah that makes such a difference
that's the way it is at my daughter's nursery school too and i think that really makes a difference they're in it because it's a profession not because it's a job that they could get because they didn't qualify for anything else you know
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh right
uh-huh
wow yeah
right
uh-huh
no yeah
yeah
uh-huh
that's exactly it see we do the same thing since galen goes to nursery school we pay our home care provider for our day care provider
full time for a whole week but she she's gone three mornings galen just doesn't go there three mornings a week but i said to her i said you know it doesn't matter if
for whatever when school holidays come around i used to have such a problem with that they wouldn't have anything to do i'd either have to
okay
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
oh
oh that's a good idea
uh-huh
oh
that'd be good
i know we
i already have them thanks
we're we are kind of getting into recycling now i'm in college and i live in a dorm and we recycle paper
and i know there's a glass plant up here and they recycle glass and you know we recycle aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah and then when our dorm we whenever our bins are all filled up we take them and turn them in and then we get money for that
yeah we just put you know we just keep it with the dorm
well we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs you know like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff
or we play games like board games we buy board games you know it's just different things whatever you know would we vote on it and whatever the dorm would want that's what we buy
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
oh that'd be good
um-hum
is that what this target is what you're
no
huh-uh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
there's i don't really know any other recycling that they do
no we no huh-uh we have to take it to a recycling place
um-hum
oh
oh i didn't know that
oh i never heard of that
oh my gosh
hm
yeah we have places where we go and we what we do is we unload our cans it's like a conveyor belt and the belt separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because of it has a magnet on it
and then they weigh all your aluminum cans and then you get money for your aluminum cans
no but now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones too
before they didn't but i know they're going to start now
um-hum
yeah uh-huh
yeah
well that's all i really know about recycling
oh really
we have kroger but not a skaggs
oh
you guys are getting into it more than we are
um-hum
huh-uh i've never seen any you know places that do i know you we reuse our grocery bags now we take them back you know and use the ones that we have
you can like if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones
yeah
yeah but we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags
um-hum
um-hum
oh my
hum
i'm a finance major
oh really
um-hum
what do you think the outcome will be
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
what do we think about them
i've never been there hum-um
yeah
uh-huh
oh well
oh
oh well is it like a foreign exchange type student
kind of about the same time every year like the same week of the same month
and then you'd have to send out
you know good flyers and then mail to all that you wanted to attend
and of course food and fun are going to be your
ways to get people there the ones that i've attended
also like at christmas time it'd be a dinner reunion
and
you need probably information about your ancestors to tie that tie you
can you speak up please
yes
but
they will accept you later in life also
yeah after your children are grown
yes
no
no i'm not some of the people that have
been involved with peace corps among other things were retired teachers
there was a retired plumber that went to
uruguay i think and helped them quite a bit with
concepts in plumbing you know providing for a
for better public hygiene
yeah but
so do you think that
people should be required to
give a couple years for the good of the country
why
well i understand but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our
seventeenth and
twenty sixth birthday to give a year or two to the to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or
the peace corps or
you know the military service or something
wouldn't we have
maybe a better class of americans
a lot of these a lot of our
pardon the terminology but yuppies now
are interested in one thing and one thing only and that's themselves
and at least if you legislated
giving
for a couple years of their lives
or
a
actually purely giving but some sort of equitable exchange then at least
the country would have gotten two years from them
where
hum
they would have given something to the country instead of take taking
away all their lives
give them your give them your entire life for two years no
it will be a job of sorts i'm sure that
the peace corps pays it doesn't pay well it's not top wages
but
but it does pay
the military
for young hiring in soldiers
does pay it doesn't pay well
okay currently in our country
especially in some regions
there's an employment problem
you're aware of that i'm sure
and texas instruments
you know in another time we had the wpa
works progress administration
during the great depression
though i can't see why it was great
that
gave people
pay that was
halfway between relief
which was welfare
and
the minimum wage
in trade for
money
and
and living
they gave them food and uniforms and
here in colorado you'll find
a great many things
public roads that were worked on by the wpa
dams that were built by the wpa
scenic overlooks
parks
we are road our road system's falling apart
and roads is falling apart
there's a lot of work to be done
i
i can't see the problem in it for a year
the
what i'm saying is that
if it were mandatory
that every person
right after graduation from high school
that were able bodied
would give a year
well or not give a year but
but trade a year
then they at least one not more than say three or four
then
it would definitely effect unemployment
i don't know
well you know texas
new mexico colorado
huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system
there's aid to dependent children
and aid to mothers of dependent children but there's no real welfare system
but if we took these people off
off the streets for a year
there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else
and who knows maybe
some of our graduating high school seniors
would find out
a little bit more the
what the traditional american work ethic means
you know we have had some problem with that in recent years
they wish only for the paycheck
really producing
yeah be it selling drugs or whatever
yeah
and
maybe if we
instilled
the work ethic
you know i enjoy the i enjoy working
some of the political trends that have started up i guess in the other side of the ocean as it were some of the
revolutions and desires for change that's going on over there when that first started going on there was a politician in the us i don't even remember his name but
he made a not so widely publicized comment that said just wait awhile and see how much us aid ends up going that way
his and he thought or predicted that poland would be one of the first ones to start seeing both in forms of debt forgiven and actual dollar values given over to them
and they took a little while but sure enough some of that stuff is coming about
so i don't know if that's going to be an ongoing trend that we're going to start helping this country and that country and breaking our own backs as it were
what do you think
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's interesting
yeah i think you're right i think over the well goodness i guess you could go back as
far as roosevelt and say that the social programs have certainly gone up and only economics have caused a few cutbacks but still the desire seems to be that the government
or the norm has become that they would desire that the government say yeah that we deserve this so you will provide this
this is part of the old happiness aspect
that's a that's an interesting thought that they're headed to be a socialist and they're headed to be democratic and maybe we're capitalist and maybe the two will meet in the middle and
and agree i don't know
um-hum
right that does seem to be a problem that even the poles faced when i think they're one of the earliest experimenters in trying to get a capitalist economy going and
some of the things that showed up is i hate the term worth it work ethic but that seems to be the one that's tied to it
that some of the poles just didn't know what it meant to get up in the morning and you know be there and put in a few extra hours if it needed it or you know a little bit of work here and work there do what it takes instead of just stamp the clock stamp the clock and forget about it give me my paycheck
though there are jobs of course that exist that way here they don't
they didn't have that worth it ec ethic and here we're headed towards socializing to the extent that there's a whole welfare population that doesn't have it
so but that's an interesting
merging as it were of the two ideas we're going one way and they're going the other
um-hum
right
right
i don't know if it'd be a political trend or not to
well i guess it is a matter of at least the government's causing it there's so much more paperwork in most every job i mean the poor teacher can't get their jobs done for the reports and the things that the government requires and
and the whole defense industry issue of having so many layers of management just to handle the paperwork and
um-hum
right
hum
yeah
i wonder if they waive that when some of these horrendously large pileups occur in california like you hear these twenty and thirty pile
all righty i'll let you go then
bye
well i do about the same i guess but in a different fashion i'm from new york originally and now that i live in florida i live in the florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime
and i feel that the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the new york times i've always read the new york times when i was younger and i try to now that it has a national edition i read that i also read
yeah well yeah that's a whole hour show actually it's an hour show each evening and we turn it on when we start dinner we seem to start dinner around six and finish it up
i find that i'm leaning on i travel a great deal even overseas and i find that i lean on c n quite a bit for concise and quick stuff and i'm
i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out i mean i don't believe everything they say but it it's coverage you know
yeah
yeah
well yeah i peter arnett was reporting direct from iraq i think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him i think that what he reported what he saw and if you didn't like it that was just too bad you know
no
that that's right i think so and i guess if it comes to magazines i don't read i used to when i was younger i subscribed to time and u s news and world report i have seemed to
slide away from that and rely more on the local paper or
i also subscribe to something called world press which is a magazine that only talks about other excerpts from the world press which sort of gives you a different slant than it's not
as slanted as the new york times or as biased perhaps as a local paper
but that i guess and the radio i listen to p b s radio a lot and i also listen to these twenty four hour news stations when i'm driving i
yeah
do you read are you from southern or northern california
so well
yeah is that what is that the san francisco paper out there is the major paper
is that pretty good
oh
yeah well can you get the l a paper up there that's a pretty decent paper isn't it or
yeah
yeah
yeah well that's another one i read i forgot that i read the wall street journal not as in depth as i used to because they their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer but
yeah i think i agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff i feel pretty well versed in what i'm doing because i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports or
although i watch that i spend a lot of time reading about these things i'm quite interested i find it very exciting to for the coverage we have now today
the
if anything they i think they listen
well i don't know i hear a lot of criticism about listening to these to the dan rathers of the world and taking their word for it or their comment actually they i think they slant things but
no kidding oh well i didn't know that yeah
yeah
yeah
well how do you feel about it i guess i got to say if that's the subject if the subject is do i feel that we're well enough equipped to i don't know if it said that i feel i'm well enough equipped
yeah to yeah
yeah i think i do too i think you have to let you yous got to segregate some of it
nice talking to you bye
i don't know if you wanna start first okay basically we're not in the city we're out in the country and we were living in the city and i think crime has escalated quite a bit just from the
quite a ways from you know other cities like new york and detroit and all of that but
just in particular crime has escalated quite a bit in murders i mean with guns and teenagers not so much with people that are in their later twenties or thirties or whatever it's basically people that are
sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen years old killing each other and there's like one a day so that kind of gets to the point that you from the years before it wasn't quite as much so
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh wow
yeah oh definitely for you guys sure and like i said in minneapolis it was basically one a day every night you were hearing about a murder whether it was between gang related murders or
but i think what's happening is at least in minneapolis the i think that people are getting fed up with it and just this morning was reading or watching a tv program on women carrying guns
to protect themselves against crime and i'm all for it i mean when it comes to if somebody's gonna do crime against me they're going to you know
i'm an old country girl that a long time ago learned how to shoot a gun and i'm not afraid of a gun and i
yeah it's hard like with in our home we have a gun in the home but i don't go out and carry it around with me in my purse but
it comes down to i think a lot of new york women do from what i've been hearing is that new york and other cities that have such a high crime rate in the subways and that are starting to carry guns so
sure
uh-huh sure
well he did it out of a pure vengeance and i think he murdered just purely because of his but if you're up against a gang of boys or teenagers
yeah
right exactly if he had shot them and shot them or wounded them or even shot just basically
not moving or whatever but i think there's a justification of where people say
most of the people are fed up with crime so when you're gonna get juries you're gonna get juries of people saying well you know this guy asked for it or this person asked for it or whatever
and i think you're gonna find less and less juries saying well the victim should be put on trial for it
when there's a crime being produced you've got people like jeff dollmeyer that was bringing people into his apartment and killing them
no that was in wisconsin that was in milwaukee area yeah so you know you've got things like that if maybe those guys would have carried a gun they could have shot him right then and there before he the guy
got them but it's just the idea that i think people are more aware of crime so i don't know i think people i don't know what's gonna happen in the future either people are going to be going back to the old west and carrying a guns
slinged you on their hip or hidden or whatever but unless something happens maybe laws change maybe some of these people that have had two or three crimes against them never released from prison
then you've got to pay for them in prison though so i don't know
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
do you have a pet randy
a poodle miniature or full size
i read somewhere that the poodle is one of the most intelligent dogs around
oh uh-huh so you you've only known the dog how long did you say
oh well is it how old is the dog
oh it's still just a pup
yeah i have a
well a mutt myself i call it a chowpherd
it's part chow and part shepherd and it as i understand it both sides of the were thoroughbreds so she's a genuine chowpherd
she has the color and the black tongue of a chow
but she has the shape of a shepherd
oh she weighs in at about fifty pounds so she's a medium size
but she's big enough to be intimidating it is a fixed female by the way
and right from day one she was teaching me
she is she's the most intelligent dog i've ever seen
course i'm
little prejudice of course
no the first time i brought her home she was only was it six weeks old
and i spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area
but next morning she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom
so on next night i spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them there
but it wasn't too long till she found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning
and since then i've i live alone
and i live in a motor home by the way i'm an rv full time rver
and it's such a pleasure to come home at night and you can see her smiling from ear to ear she's so happy to see me
and i don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not
uh-huh
well my dog's an outdoor type she does not like to be indoors
she'd rather sleep outside on the cold ground at night
but i do make her come in
and i feed her indoors that's to lure her in but during the day i have her on a on a leash
which is on sort of a run i have a thirty foot cable
running from one stake to another and then attached to that is a twelve foot leash so she can cover quite an area
and she's the best
burglar alarm going
oh yeah she it's the strangest thing though children
no matter how strange they are or how new they might be can walk right up to her
but adults if they're strange to her or they look suspicious or something boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off
and i have not discovered yet where the line is between children and adults
but she is a great comfort to me
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
what you mean she didn't appreciate all that attention
uh-huh what's her name by the way
what do you call the dog
mitzi yeah mine is gin
as in martini
actually it's gin two
because when i was a teenager in high school i had gin one
but then when i went out in the world i
couldn't take her with me
uh-huh
oh yeah
ah what a shame
um-hum
oh well
well randy we've just about used up our time here and i must say it was interesting i enjoyed talking about pets with you
maybe we'll get together again in the future
take care now bye
yeah
which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from when they when they announced it but
developed a little more i guess but haven't changed that much what about you are you involved at all
yes
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
yeah it
that's mine it you know i go back it to me
it's not a government it's not the constitution doesn't apply but it
drug program is required to get the government contracts and i'd
it yes okay and our company has taken that and gone all the way say okay first off
we don't we don't have enough courage to
pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage
because that would offend them if they if they weren't so we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even
and
then but and they've so it's a complete random testing well it's random in the sense that you don't know when it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested
and you know i sit at a terminal and write software all day it
certainly has no life threatening capabilities
you know in my job and yes i agree that there are there are
well
yeah i that i that i will give credit to our company for in that
coarse kind of test and then there's a much more
refined test
spectrography or whatever it's called they chromatography to determine exactly what the what the things are and
no i i've been with this company for sixteen years now and
at that time i could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't you don't know but on the other hand someone new coming in that knows they're gonna have a test that's
well bonny
how do you do your budget
uh-huh
yeah
utilities and stuff like that
yeah
uh-huh
huh
yeah i kind of think you ought to make them wait until the last possible minute for it
we do ours fairly similar course we both have married before
and so what we do is kind of divide up the bills based on who makes the most money
and whoever makes the most money course takes the most you know the biggest part of the bills
i wish we could do that unfortunately
between two divorces it kind of it kind of taps you out pretty good
oh yeah it that takes a big hunk out of your budget it costs me about three thousand dollars a year for child support
which is after i mean that's net that's right after i pay the taxes and stuff on it
yeah
that's what i hear although i kind of miss some of that stuff
yeah but you know you know bills wise we kind of divide everything up and i take i take the bigger portion of it and my wife takes some of hers
unless of course it's like for a present or whatever
and we have snuck some pretty good size presents in here
yeah i was trying to finagle our budget around because my wife wanted
she really wanted a little small five inch tv she could carry around the house or you know back in her sewing room whenever she's watching television
and she wanted one so bad and we were just kind of short on money
and so all through the year i was putting you know five or ten dollars back fifteen twenty whatever i could spare i was putting back in a little envelope in there
i was hanging onto it i thought god you know come christmas time we're going to have that television set come hell or high water
and sure enough we got it
uh-huh
yeah
how do you just divide up your the money just you just make a deposit in the bank and kind of go from there huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
he's got a stable schedule then
everything kind of works out well
yeah if you don't have to go down to the bank for something you can kind of put it in there if you have the tendency to go to the bank you kind of well i'll take five or ten dollars here
oh
oh yeah
uh-huh tex tower yeah
that's good
that's not too bad
that that's cutting it pretty close though
well i think everybody has problems meeting bills now
not too much you can do about it
between the taxes and everything else everything goes up faster than the salary does
oh yeah so do we
uh-huh
yeah they want their money real quick
that's the only bad part we got the same problem
however i guess it beats the alternative
just not having anything to start out with
oh yeah
well you get if you just keep trying pretty soon you make it
well you know kids are important you got you have to stay home with the kids
well soon as they get in to school it won't it won't be so bad
well bonny
it sounds like a pretty good idea
tell you what i think we about done our about five minutes
okay we'll check you later
bye-bye
do you believe in capital punishment
yeah
yeah well i think that based on certain crimes it is merited there was a case just recently i don't know if you if you heard about this in new hampshire i believe
about the teacher school teacher who hired her one of her high school students to kill her husband and they found her guilty and gave her life with no parole
when she's going to be in prison for the rest of her life with no chance of parole ah what good does it do anybody and the taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for the rest of her life she's a young woman in her late twenties i guess
so i just
early well i could be yeah
i don't know i didn't hear that much about it just the verdict that they had
i don't really know about that
if well i think it's only it only applies to a very few types of crimes murder and i think kidnapping could carry death penalty as well
i'm not sure what the range is for the crimes that would merit a death penalty
i think it depends on what it was they did and if the evidence was if there was no doubt in my mind that person was guilty of that crime
to the rest of the population or you can put them out of everybody's misery i don't know it's a real moral dilemma
to that type of
um-hum
right yeah
when you see all the people who are convicted of these crimes and they get out of prison after a few years
all of the sudden here they're committing the same type of crimes all over again other people are victimized what do you do about it
no i never did
uh-huh
okay
right
well some people just are incorrigible and there's no way that they can ever deal with society and abide by rules
so in a case like that given what crime they're guilty of yeah i could i could justify a death penalty for somebody who just has no chance of ever reforming or coming to grips with living in normal society
yeah i believe so
well people who tend to be say on death row i think they're kept in isolation all the time
i don't believe that they're given a chance to do anything productive or even mix with the rest of the prison community
i know several people at work who've been called on juries and they absolutely hate it
well so much of it is game playing with the lawyers they're doing their plea bargaining and give and take type situation that they're playing with people's lives in effect by offering to
offering to announce their guilt to a certain degree on a crime in order to get a lighter sentence
yeah i'm in that area uh-huh
yes i have automobile vandalism
my gosh
yeah
right
sure
yeah i'd
i don't have much sympathy for people that are
victimizing others on a regular basis you know if it's a one time offense and the kid learns his lesson and shows remorse and promises never to do something again and they take some steps to educate him in the matter
it's one thing but when they're there over and over again and guilty of the same crimes nothing seems to help
yeah well i think it depends on what the crime is you're not going to sentence somebody to death for stealing a car if it's first degree murder or
right no something like that is just unforgivable
right
yeah
i think people like that when they do get put in prison with the other hard core prisoners the child molesters in particular are not looked on kindly by the other prisoners they don't get a lot of respect and they probably tend not to even survive in that type of environment
because even in prison they have their code of ethics i guess if you can call it that
sure
yeah they don't have any really useful job skills lots of places no
um-hum
right you've got life without parole something like that
sure well case like charles manson he's been eligible for parole a couple of times already his case comes up every few years now i guess
and people have to stand up and denounce him again and claim that he's not fit for society but we're that close to letting people like that out of prison
uh-huh my mother used to work at the plano location i think she moved back down into closer into dallas
so okay let me let me hit one hold on a second here
okay
uh-huh
okay my favorite i have a lot of favorites i like to try a lot of different things
there's very few foods that i don't like i don't like asparagus and beets and anything else i can pretty much eat recently i went to a french restaurant and i had something called spinach fettucini and crawfish
and it was so delicious i've been talking about it it's my birthday and i've been talking about it ever since it's been about a week now i've been talking about this plate of food and the real important part of it for me in a restaurant is the service
in this particular french restaurant was our problem to be going back again and again they there were three waiters that waited on the entire restaurant they just all kept an eye on all the tables
and something that really impressed me was that i asked one waiter for butter
uh-huh
exactly
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that's probably not a chain restaurant
i find that most family owned restaurant or single restaurant you get the best service simply because that restaurant belongs to somebody it has the family name on it
and so whoever's in there is going to take care of you as opposed to going into a chain restaurant where they're just hiring you know people out of that really don't probably don't care too much about the establishment so they're not going to worry about taking care of you
whereas someone that actually is there that owns it that you know has been working there for twenty years or so they want they want you to be happy so you get the service and you know of course with that will come the good food
uh-huh
exactly
exactly
uh-huh
exactly the guy that took me out to this french restaurant he works in a hotel nearby and he just happened to mention to the waiter that he sends a lot of the people from the hotel over to the guy's restaurant
and at the end of our meal you know we're ready to go and we're full and this guy sends us a platter of each dessert
that the restaurant has so it was like ten desserts on one plate and he just gave it to us to eat of course we couldn't eat it but you know he just did this and so the next time when we come in he'll probably remember us
exactly
exactly
one of my favorite restaurants is steak and ale now that's a chain sort of a chain restaurant
but they seem to i like i like atmosphere myself and their food is good and i really like the salad bar and that gets me into a restaurant if there is really good salad bar because i love salads and soups and things like that
right
i
uh-huh
did you just recently try it uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
all right
uh-huh
right
probably that it heats up real good and uh-huh
and that was on a television advertisement one of them nineteen ninety five deals yeah okay
that sounds good yeah i don't like i've tried probably just about everything just because i don't like to
you know i don't i hate one thing i hate to do in a restaurant is to be with someone that want try things
uh-huh
yeah the little crunchy things i never know what they are i just call them the crunchers
so
uh-huh
that sounds good i love catfish
uh-huh and i love shrimp
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah i don't like scallops too much their they have kind a funny taste i can eat them but they're
uh-huh
hum yeah
yeah
yeah i'm originally from new york i grew up there so i got to eat a lot of i mean just fresh i mean one
one day we were out just driving and they are always oriental people with their little stands
and they're selling things and we decided we were going to buy this thing we didn't know what it was we got in the car and opened it up and started eating it and it was really good and we figured out that it was octopus
you know so we all kind of freaked out but you find all kinds of seafood things in up there where all the
harbors are and things
yeah
ah
now that's something i may not try yeah i've heard that's good i've heard frog legs are good i haven't had any of those yet so i'll have to try those one day
uh-huh exactly that's
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
hum
uh-huh
right
i think my favorite meat is lamb
no i think i think it's got a i like the texture of it is why i like it not so much taste but the it's not real chewy or
i mean it's just real good to me i can't really describe why but
yeah i like veal too
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i bet
right
i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force
few are basically staying home and
being homemakers and raising kids exclusively
uh-huh
yeah true well mine taught kindergarten but she was always
i guess her schedule was shorter so she was always home
yeah
yeah that statistic i guess has been growing every year it's something around sixty five percent or so now
i'm not sure what the future holds for that whether
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah that is tough yeah we're looking at that now my wife's about six months along
uh-huh
true
yeah
i'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home
i would think it would be women that were working full-time
huh
uh-huh
huh
well i guess that's good they got something to keep them active
yeah we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible
what do you think
yeah we think it's that important and
i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction i'm a counselor and a therapist and i work with adolescents and
i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure
uh-huh
um-hum
true
well the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure and
and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too so kids are raised around their friends and by the media
that's contributed
yeah maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time so
if there was some way for women to stay home even if they could work you know there are a lot of
jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would
at least in some ways
bridge the gap
about
they'll understand them
the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while
it's hard to say
families are such a strange configuration anymore
i see a lot of families where you know in the in the
back i grew up about the same time you did
back in those times we
pretty much were taught how to be responsible
nowadays it's not the case kids don't kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and
one of the reasons i guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working
they get bombarded with junk and they don't have to do anything around the house they never learned to be responsible when the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
so
it's not a real functional situation anyway
i don't know it's i don't know that trend's going to change the single parent type families and the blended families
as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society
uh-huh
yeah it is i guess unless there's a major swing in the change of what's important to people
you know probably keep going downhill
and i don't know we feel like that we can make it on one income it may be tough but we may have to give up some
some things
yeah
yeah i think so too
okay
well i've enjoyed it stephanie
uh-huh
bye-bye
yeah
well okay i heard it a lot of times i should know it by now talk about food and cooking and then it got into what would you i guess what foods would you serve at a dinner party
oh really
a healthy person
-ell i'm impressed
right
uh-huh it is
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah it was pretty good we got it we got it real cheap is why we got it and i'll probably do it next year to it saved an awful lot of work
yeah
oh really
yeah i've never really tried one though
and the days after i got off the jury one of my topics the first day was what do you think of juries and the jury system and the next day was what do you think of capital punishment so it was pretty funny because i had a lot to say on that
oh really well that's good well listen it was good talking to you and i hope your wife's feeling better
well good all right bye-bye
do you i don't
no i'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know
i agree with it i think i think a company should be able to test at any employee anytime they see fit
i just i just don't think there's a place in our environment you know in the work
force for drugs or alcohol either
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
you did uh-huh
well i can sort of understand that but not being a teacher as you are you know i was not quite as sympathetic as you know as i probably would have been if kay were a teacher or something
but
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right that's right
that's right and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know but
yeah i think so too i agree with it i know kay's company you know they started it couple of years ago
and so many of the people even the professional people were boy they were so against them doing that you know and i thought jeez to me it's quite simple
you either need a job or you don't the job is what provides all of your needs
and if they say hey you can't do this work i'd say hey i agree i don't i won't do that and i think most of them have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first
yeah it is i can see where you would think yeah that is belittling you know i'd probably feel the same way
if i had to do that
yeah that's true
you bet oh gosh they would really raise a stink if that was to happen
fight it tooth and nail you know
oh well we'd better keep talking because i've not heard it have we have you heard it
about random testing
yeah
is that right
you just don't think of that happening with teachers
i really don't i when i think of drug testing i'm thinking of the
you outside of education
sure i know that but you don't think of that first hand normally
isn't that
isn't that mind boggling goodness it is it's mind and well you know i agree with you i know
yeah
you think the benefit would be greater than the
uh-huh
and that was in your children's high school isn't that amazing
if it if it's if it was true there i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is
you know because they represent a pretty good
no certainly not certainly not
they don't need that example but
you're a student oh okay so you have a wardrobe to choose
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh does your does it change pretty much from does it change from season to season or is it pretty standard
even in the winter you go from your warm car to your warm building so there really isn't that much of a
and cooler things in the summer but i for my husband he wears pretty standard all year round because it's so climatized his work situation but we just recently done something that we found
really helpful with his wardrobe and that is we send all of his shirts and his slacks to the dry cleaners and we hadn't been doing this previously i was
you know washing them and ironing and taking care of them at home and we found that it makes them wear and look so much better to have just everything dry cleaned i don't know whether you
the dry cleaner comes right to his place of work and picks the articles up and takes them
and dry-cleans them and brings them back the next day and then they give
the company a fifteen percent discount so it really
it really is not that expensive and we figure you know what it saves on wear and tear and then and saving me having to do it and they look so much better when they're dry-cleaned
than when i do so that it does it does and that's kind of a
just a you know thing we've recently started that's that we found really helpful
no he doesn't he wears if he has an a meeting or an important thing he wears a suit and tie but most of the time it's just dress slacks and you know white shirt usually and a tie
so that now that's interesting do you wear when on the days that like monday through friday do you wear slacks mostly or dresses or
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh even during the week they do huh or i mean on weekends do they
not on the weekend
oh
oh huh what about like shoe type things do you wear mostly dress shoes or do you wear tennis shoes or what
oh
oh
so can you wear right what you wear to school to work you don't have to change
well
oh
uh-huh
oh well that's interesting okay well can you
let's see about two weeks is all
my brother
he yes well he's in plano that's just outside dallas yeah
oh are you yes plano
yeah i wonder should we wait until she comes on and disconnects us to talk about all this or
oh what was i gonna
that style huh
yeah
tailored
we have a sheltie collie a miniature sheltie
yeah it's about oh about six months old
and we're we live in an apartment so we don't have a yard so it has to stay inside and we're having a difficult time trying to train it
it's about six months
really
um-hum
yeah
so how'd y'all how do you what's the best method
right
stand outside with them until they
well we're hardly ever at home so it's kind of difficult and
you know you don't wanna you don't wanna spank it or scare it or anything like that so
yeah we try to take it
yeah a lot of times and you know it won't it's whole job outside and it comes inside
yeah we've tried that and
you know there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go so and he chews on plants and all that but you know that's natural for a little puppy huh
oh really
oh that's sad
huh
how old is it
man that's sad
oh of course not
i couldn't
that is really sad what what's the deal we try to we're trying to take it on walks now you know
and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash
and so it i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it i mean it just goes like a mad dog i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping and
um-hum well we've heard bad we've heard some bad things about some of those you know they
sometimes misuse their
license or whatever you know and they treat them bad
oh really
oh really
uh-huh
how long did it take
every what
oh really
well sheltie collies are you know timid and they don't really unless they get used to something they're really nervous and
yeah and if they're not accustomed to something they they're really scared so
yeah i'm in the same position i started on a commodore in nineteen eighty six and moved up in eighty eight to an ibm system and i'm running on an ibm clone right now
and i've used it also i do tremendous amounts of word processing i work in radio but i'm required to do a lot of you know journalistic writing and that
so i do almost everything now in word or in some other you know word processing system and use it to gather news and information and put it all together for something that's usable
so i've had my computer i've i i've found what's happened is that i can't write anymore on paper you know
because i type so fast now that any it's distracting to try and write by hand because it takes too long
oh yeah
i'm the i'm the net coordinator up here for western and central new york
part of net 260 here it's got we have eighty nodes in this city alone
so we try and get everybody together and that way it you know you can exchange mail between them and you don't have to call them
and i just got into the fidonet's now has a thing where we can get in with the internet so i found out
yeah i it's where i found out about this through comp dcom telecom
and i submit some messages on there i it's made things so much easier it's amazing though that
and then here's what we have now i mean what's in five years from now it's just unimaginable what we're going to be able to do with these things
hm
well that's good gore's working on
yeah
well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're going to have a glut of things everyone i think we're going to see another revolution in
computers but i think the reason why it didn't work the first time is that they assumed that everybody would need a computer to do all these things
when in fact at the time you know back in the early eighties and mid eighties you know people didn't the technology wasn't to the point where
it was something that could be easily learned for everyone but now we have the things like the mac and windows and other things where all you got to do is point at something and push a button
and i think that the technology's catching up to the point where we're going to be able to do things and make it a lot easier for people to understand how to do these things
so i'm hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will be a little more friendly to the end user
um-hum
well they're working on that i'm a satellite dish owner and we've been fighting like mad to have these suckers re-regulated you know
because of the because they've stomped on us
and so now what's happening is the phone companies want to get into cable and introduce all these kinds of computer services over fiber optics
and the cable industry now wants to get into the telephone industry through these personal communication things
i agree
uh-huh
oh yeah i agree yeah
i don't like that no i don't like that at all i know my husband served on a on a jury
a few months ago up here in denton that was a guy it was it was a drug conviction and i don't remember he had some cocaine and it was accused of selling it and i don't remember exactly how much he had but actually not selling it there's a
and you know they were told that you know during the trial that this is this guy's first offense and he's got this clean record and they ended up the jury you know decided hey it's time to crackdown here you know and it's time to do this drug thing and let's crackdown and let's really and they sentenced
let me come over in just a second okay
and sat down with the judge and with the other two lawyers and they were told that he would probably serve three
however they could not tell the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal
so the jury didn't know about it so here they based their sentencing
thinking that this was this guy's first offense and so you know we'll give him fifteen which'll teach him a lesson but it's not just
something i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change you know
yeah obviously what we're doing is not working you know no
yeah and there's you know there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form and either they're in there forever or when they get out they're you know it's a matter of a few months and they're gonna be right back for the same thing so the
that's very true yeah i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day and i said you know i understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the united states
but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves i mean we and it i know people say oh it would be cruel to you know pull our aid from these other countries and maybe so tell them you've got five years
to work out a plan to make it on your own
it by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help
and then we'll have all we'll we will have the money if we would do that
to work on our own system because we've got some serious problems here and we're trying to heal the world you know it's just not
it's just not working
you know kids here in the united states that are dying every day too you know and being
abused and neglected and you know i don't know i just have this problem with
yeah
i think we should try it like you say if it doesn't work we can always come back but i think it would be a good idea to try it
okay let's see what do you use or how do you control your money
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah sure what we what we try to do is of course you have to pay your necessities first right
and you know your rent and whatever else and then after that we always put away some money for savings no matter how much it is you know how little or whatever you know
and then after that then we have then our you know spending money or whatever for miscellaneous things
but one thing that we've used and it's kind of good because it gives you kind of a savings plan sort of
and what it is we have a ledger you know just a book and in it in it we have different accounts
that let's say i would save a hundred dollars a month or something that's what would go into savings for instance
we have it so that in that ledger you know the bank just has it as a hundred dollars going into savings
well what we do is we take that ledger and we take that hundred dollars and we break it down into different categories
so for instance let's say twenty dollars would go to the cars you know car repair maintenance or whatever another
right and another twenty dollars would go to our clothes another twenty dollars would go to you know kids toys or something you know
and so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that
and it seems to work
right
and so it you know it seems to
it seems to work pretty good you know the only part is you got to keep track of it you know every month of stuff
but that seems to work pretty good and see other things we do is just
just try to
just try not to spend a whole lot you know with some things of course you have to you know
and we try to you know make sure where we go and try to catch something on sale or something like that
but how about you guys
uh-huh
uh-huh
right uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's a good idea yeah
have you gone to any of those places that you know like i guess the different names for them are like the price club or sam's or
things like that
uh-huh
that's
yeah i've been in a couple and it seems like you can get pretty good you know stretch your money there because you get the big things you know
right
uh-huh
and that's and one of my i recently got a master's in computer science or computer systems
and one of the things i really learned a lot was there's a number of programs for the computers for if you happen to have a personal computer or whatever that a lot of programs that'll help you know budget your money and
yeah
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
right that can get you in trouble pretty quick
uh-huh
right
well that sounds that sounds pretty good
well you have anything else to say or any other
plans that you use i like what you say about the recycling thing looking at something before you get rid of it that's a good that's a good thing
uh-huh
oh did you
well we did we did something like that too we recently moved here from california and we had a there was like a bargain fair you know where everybody brings stuff to sell
and there really we made a lot of money i was surprised a lot of baby clothes we sold and stuff that we don't need any more and stuff but
but i was surprised yeah that's a good way to make some money
yeah that's right
uh-huh
oh that's good
so we're in a fairly
exclusive neighborhood and got a big house
five thousand square feet with
a bunch of kids running around
and horrible real estate taxes and everything else
so it's about all we can afford
uh-huh
well that's interesting because i i've i heard around dallas that real estate was up for grabs
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well we've sort of got the other end of the spectrum going here the
we had mobil oil corporation move their corporate headquarters here about five years ago
and i bought this house just before they moved down
and when they moved in here the price on houses just about doubled all over the area
and
so we got ours at a fairly good price
but it stimulated a lot of the builders to start building fancy homes
and so we've got a lot of houses
within a few miles of us that are one million and a half
and
yeah it helps the value of our property except we
he sold it for only slightly more than he paid for it four five years ago
and
so he's kind of knocked down the neighborhood for a little while until that average goes out but an awful lot of these fancy homes are not selling
because they built them and put all this money into them and nobody's interested in buying
uh-huh
well they're doing some strange things here i think that the price of real estate's gotten so high
and they're trying to get the value out of the homes so they subdivide around here they'll put a million dollar home on a half acre lot
and you know you put a five thousand square foot house on
on a half acre lot or one you know half acre lot and you can clip the lawn with a pair of scissors
yeah
well sometimes it keeping after the yard gets me we enjoy sailing quite a bit
and sometimes we go off on a one week cruise
uh-huh
yeah that's one of the things i have to face up to there's quite a few retired people in our neighborhood
and it seems like all they have to do is go out there and put down lime and spread fertilizer and pull up dandelions and
take care of their lawn as beautiful lawn and i come over and look at my lawn and this nicely cut crabgrass and dandelions and plantains and everything else under the sun coming up
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
is that your version of counting sheep
uh-huh
yeah
well we're kind of fortunate we're right about halfway between national airport and dallas
and so they've sort of established sort of a no man's land here
and so we don't get any traffic from dulles over the house and we don't get any traffic from national
and but you can sit in the backyard and you can watch the planes lining up for the approach
yeah that's not well it's about forty five minute drive from here
oh
oh i used to have box turtles well years ago when i was growing up i
i really liked them
oh
yes we have one dog a bichon frise
our friends in houston bred the dogs i had never heard of them
they're all white and they're small and fluffy they don't shed i guess they are distantly related to a poodle but
they're not very well known in this country and they're not high strung or over bred
ours is on the small end and she's about ten pounds and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds
and they love people
and kids and that was something we were looking for
our love is golden retrievers and
that's what we had intended to get in houston but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig and love the water and we thought that was kind of a tough climate
oh
yeah
what they really are they're really sweet dogs we've we thought probably our neighborhood in houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of
the family that had them and bred them they had five litters of puppies and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood because
it's b i c h o n f r i s e
bichon frise
yeah they're
and they don't shed so they're good dogs for people with allergies and they love people i mean they're
no not really ours
ours barks more than
some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house we used to swap back and forth dogs that they have three dogs they had a cockapoo and two bichons
and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there and
now it's funny she's a good watch dog i mean if there's
she'll bark that way but she also talk a lot she
no and they're very smart dogs the circuses in europe used to use them for the acts they
oh they'll dance on their hind legs each
well she's no longer breeding them but because her dogs
the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and the one male that she used had a tooth problem
and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as pets you know they weren't show quality
oh but yeah it takes a lot of time
yeah but she might have some contacts here i know i know that
the dog's grandmother
was from plano
not too bad really i had a razor that i got for christmas that i just i really didn't want it but i got it anyway and
it was a braun and they were real good about taking it back it wasn't a problem at all so i was able to get that back pretty easily
but i don't know i really haven't returned a whole lot lately have you
yeah
right like
exactly i was reading
right i was reading something in consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact they were talking about cars the car issue just came out and about how yeah you'd like to buy an american car maybe but you know the transmission may be made in japan or whatever
like i've got an eighty six ford ranger and i know for a fact that the transmission is made by mitsubishi you know so it's like what are you going to do you know
but that's the way it is i don't know i personally feel that
if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them you know that's the way it goes and you know people american manufacturers should get a clue and you know they should start making quality products and
that's what i thought too until i saw the consumer reports issue they've got all the american well all the all the cars rated you know and
essentially i don't see much of a trend i mean just like every other time that you look at it the honda accords and the civics are right up there there's nothing wrong with them
and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy and they're pieces of junk you know
yeah that's ninety that's eighty six through ninety one but i don't know maybe they're getting better maybe they're starting to get a clue
yeah that's just it technology that comes in right now is probably not going to be implemented until you know quite a few years down the road but
oh yeah because technology is so you know volatile and changing all the time
yeah
i don't know
yeah
right they're kind of the leaders right now you know i used to see all those commercials for windows you know and you're like oh gee they're reselling a macintosh under a different name
yeah you know almost
exactly almost is the key word there too you know because i really i've used both and i really don't see an advantage of windows at all
yeah that's just it
but i don't know i'm really i've gotten a little bit out of the personal computer business just because i don't have one at home i do use a mac at work but
i really don't do much with it at home but
right uh-huh yeah you sound like you must work in the computer business
yeah all right
no
well that's all right
yeah that's true
something that i find uncomfortable is you know you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer
and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know let let's take the example of a modem for you know
okay what baud rate do you get well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred baud
hi
or doing or doing public service
well
in order to go in order to join the peace corps you have to have a college degree
and so that eliminates a lot of people from that and doing public service how are they supposed to support themselves
well yeah i think that's a good idea although i don't i think if it's something that's forced on you
i think that the attitude
is not going to be quite the same
yeah
yeah from what i've read most people in the united states do some type of volunteer work at some time in their lives
but i right but i agree it has to be at their choice and it needs to be a time when they're ready to do it
i don't think you can just snatch somebody away from
you know you don't know what their circumstances are or what's going on in their life you can't just snatch them away and make them go do something they don't want to do
then that raises a question of how you know are you going to pay them or are you going to provide them with you know
place to live and food to eat and whether they have a family you know
yeah
that's true that's true
i'm not sure i'm not sure if it's a way to cut down government expenses or it's like you said that's something more you know to make people aware
yeah what's going on and what needs to be done but i really do think that the that people are pretty well aware i think more so now than ever before
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah and i think that that's the trend now i think that's the trend now and i think people are a lot more willing to give of their time
and help out
yeah and get and get more out of it
no i don't think i would either
do what you can when you can right then as long as you feel good about yourself and what you're doing to help i think that's more important than
nice talking
yeah really
well it does kind of catch you by surprise
bye-bye
okay i guess they're
okay
i guess i
haven't really thought about it for a while i guess
the job part of the one i have now there is a
requirement that kind of came in after the fact that does since they have contracts one of their companies they contract with required it and
you know by then it was it was kind of
you know they didn't explain up front that might be a requirement but it sounded like it was kind of sprung on them by the firms they had contracts with
but it's not something i
think is appropriate i guess there might be exceptions you know if you're in a critical position like you're a traffic controller or something like that
but it should
it seems like
i guess the employer
is just
i think a massing too much information there's it's just an intrusion into
kind of your personal life
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right
right
yeah i know think most impairments would be fairly obvious you know but
right
um-hum
wow
yeah
yeah
um-hum
done it and they
you know the climate would be different then
uh-huh
right
yeah
uh-huh yeah
yeah it just seems like it's a intrusion i mean the only angle they might have is if
i guess if they're paying the insurance premium or something like that then it you know
it might be that they the carrier they're using has a
has higher rates or something like that so there's probably an economic argument
they want us to talk about
football our favorite football teams and it doesn't sound like to you yours will be the dallas cowboys with your accent
oh right
oh okay where are you
plano i'm in dallas
well what are you doing down here you working
oh is he is he with ti
okay
right
your favorite team is the new york giants
well that's true but that happens after the anytime you're the super bowl team it's hard to repeat because everybody's shooting for you
you don't think that maybe their desire is not there or maybe they're a year older
yeah
you don't think parcells saw the handwriting and thought he'd be better to go out as a winner
i know it but see he can only go up from there because they're so bad
do you think phil simms might have been treated badly since he got bumped aside for hostetler
yeah but do you do you think it's fair because simms was hurt that he didn't get his job back and then if he didn't do the job put hostetler in there
that's right
it
it just seemed to me that everybody was just a half a step off i don't know whether it was age or
determination or coaching or what you know because it just somehow they were almost there all the time but
uh-huh
one of those things where everything just falls in place for you know
that's right but look what happened to them the last couple of years
yeah that's true
were you out there
oh well i've had season tickets since nineteen sixty seven so i've seen a few games
so it's do well do you think lawrence taylor is about had it
yeah i know he's fun to watch yeah he's great to watch and
yeah well you think y'all -ll fire your coach
yeah they probably will
uh-huh
well
well i think he probably had to had pressure long enough and he wants to go somewhere where he can you know i can see his point it was a good time for him to leave really
yeah
yeah well what do you think you all's draft needs are for next year or do you get into it that deep uh-huh
well didn't y'all lose your tight end also that
yeah
what
what happened to him did they trade him or did he go
is that i couldn't remember what happened to him
because he was good
okay i guess we're on the air now
i haven't had too much experience with judges and jurors
i've served on a jury one time and i think one of my concerns after that experience was
finding that there tend to be people in the jury that can't bring themselves to sentence someone
yeah i'm inclined to agree you do need a fixed and clear sentence there
yeah
yes
um-hum
yeah i think that was a logical decision there
um-hum
well yeah i think they went back for a brief hearing on the sentence
but that was that was fairly quick i think that is something that we need in this country i know the last time i was down in the caribbean
we had visited the island of saint thomas which is american
and there were twenty three unsolved murders and nobody seem to be concerned about it
at the same time there was one unsolved murder on the island of tortola and the whole island wanted to know when the hanging was going to take place
i've never really been sure that a juror is entitled to ask a question
um-hum
yes
i don't know whether they can go back and call witnesses for that though it's it depends on the they can ask points of order of law
and maybe they can ask for a review of the transcript
but asking questions during the trial my experience as a juror well it was a traffic situation there were three points of law that had to be made
and the county attorney did not make the points
but the defendant took the stand on his own behalf
um-hum
i work for e systems
okay
okay
oh i know hal ammon quite well
okay
well say hi to al or hal the next time you see him
and tell
yeah well tell him that bill mayhood sell said hi
okay
all right
thank you good night
you don't use any credit cards i don't imagine
yeah
yeah
uh-huh do you use them a lot
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
oh well that's an idea that's a thought um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
my husband loves them
we do use them
we try not to but he he's one who believes in credit cards and he uses them quite a bit
he likes doing that
um-hum
and that's when you get into expenses
it's
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
well sometimes you do come on bargains and that and it's really useful
and some places won't take you know like a personal check or cash even
but they would take a credit card
um-hum
right
we you know we go to places where they don't charge extra some of them charge five cents a gallon even like the gas stations more
and we just try to avoid you know
the ones that do that we just don't go there
because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything extra
because actually to me
credit cards are the same as cash
to me they are anyways
right
right yeah
yes
well i can't say we never have
now we have you know at times made payments on our things but we try not to
we try real hard
um-hum
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
yeah because sometimes there's times when you may maybe couldn't take advantage of something
but with a credit card you can
so
well i think we're narrowing it down actually
that we use most of the time
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yes
well
it's not every week but you do get them they make it very readily available
almost too much so
but i really don't like it the charges they you know
we try to limit look at that also what they charge per year
but
um-hum
right
okay what
opinion do you have about what was what happened
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah see i feel like i don't know i feel like the
motivation bush is a member of the trilateral commission and he's a member he was a member of the skull and bones at i think at princeton or yale i'm not yale
and his motivations are i don't feel like he was absolutely on the up and up with us on you know the true motivation he talks a lot about the new world order
and most americans probably don't really know what that would mean and i maybe i'm being maybe i'm assuming too no i don't think most would i really don't and so i feel like the real motivation was something that
most people would have absolutely no idea and that motivation is to you know to establish a one world order and to break up the monopoly power of the middle east will
you know i'm not afraid of what they've done i'm not afraid of saddam hussein i feel he's lost and you know he needs to get saved just like the everybody else but
you know i just i guess i have kind of like hum kind of real cautious in the whole thing because i know that there's a motive that hasn't been openly discussed or revealed to anybody and that's where that's why i really don't have a real
set opinion because i don't know everything i don't you could watch news all the time but you don't know anything hardly and he did talk about that though he did he at least he did mention it
you know what i'm saying i don't think most people understand what he's talking about when he talks about that new world order
so i don't know what do you think of that
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum but the motivation though see wasn't didn't have anything i don't believe it had anything to do with the oil because
i think i feel like the real motivation of the war was to break up that arab power not
to disperse the oil but to they were a big problem for the unifying of the eec the european economic community which are gonna become i mean they're gonna be
they're gonna put us under if we don't become part of the new world order next year the united states if we don't
i mean we're going to be in big trouble because when europe unites that's why ti's building plants in italy because they're going to have power like we can't imagine
and so the i think bush wanted to break up this other power thing
and it looks real good but in the end
i just see that ultimately who's going to be in charge of this one world order you know what i mean is george bush really any better than saddam hussein or does he just look better do you know what i'm saying i mean i think one person
in power that's not really seeking god and wanting to do good for the people and not deal for selfish motives is very dangerous and i don't see that this one world this new world order that him and gorbachev keep talking about i just don't see that
that's just a real good thing but i think it's something that's going to happen but i guess that's what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be you know
get more power over that arab
lands when they try and next year really start pushing this new world order well he talks about it all the time i mean
i mean that's all he talks about but anyway there's a good book by larry abraham you probably have heard of none dare call it treason and call it conspiracy
well anyway call it conspiracy is a real good book and he talks a lot about this i've heard him interviewed some so i think it's kind of interesting but anyway he probably has a new book out that i don't know about yet because i haven't heard him in a while but
you know i'm like going hey peter jennings you know he knows a little bit but
oh my money's in the stock market oh i can't believe they're doing this but it doesn't change anything so i'm just like
i don't know just i mean i would most people probably think i don't even have a high school education you know because of my attitude about it but i just feel like there's so much going on
um-hum
so imagine the sixteen year old yep boy i had a surprise birthday party and a war started in israel
that'll be a good story when she's thirty won't it
well anyway well i guess do you think we're finished
isn't that funny i bet they're going to do a lot of research on that
i know
uh-huh
really he probably had those glasses on like you know those annie hall kind of glasses i don't know what you call it john lennon glasses that's what they are the women i call annie hall glasses but
is i don't know if they're annie hall glasses or not i just i don't know i always think of annie hall when i see them but
really i know the female version of john lennon's but
i know i talked to some guy who was i talked to some of the yuppie types you know and they're pretty interesting but yeah they're real opinionated but i guess that's better than nothing you know
but yeah it's been interesting though all these different people and some of them are real friendly you know and it's like yeah man when i come to dallas i'll call you know and then others of them are like they just wanna go but then some of them have babies crying in the background too so
there may be other reason than you know that but well anyway are you in dallas
yeah i had a guy from rhode island that we talked about fishing so and oh i had i've had people in massachusetts and vermont they work at ti up there do you work at ti
see mine does too in dallas and yeah but no there's ti's up in rhode island and stuff and that guy talked about fishing and i asked him if he took his wife and
if anything happens interesting in the war maybe they'll have another thing and we'll get you again all right bye
fringe benefits are very important in the in the company i think to provide the employee with a sense of security
yes at the rising cost of health care now it's if you have to go out and buy your company coverage you probably have to spend three four hundred dollars a month to get anything that even came close to it
yeah
we we've just got dental insurance after the first of the year it's been i think probably
oh about eight or nine years since we had dental coverage and it sure makes a difference and
yeah
i think the in the insurance area one of the things that we also got that we didn't have what we haven't had in about eight years is the card for prescriptions where you go in and just pay a minimal amount for prescriptions
and we have some that are fairly expensive sixty seventy dollars well now we pay eight dollars for them
no that's just all prescriptions
yeah and it's a i think it's five dollars on generic drugs and eight dollars on a name brand drug so no matter what they are in fact you have to pay the certain basic cost
for them you don't have to meet any deductible or anything
but
really depending on what you need kind of it's a case that there if you need more than a couple weeks or eight days or whatever it may be then they will consider it
so that's been with the companies i've been with generally at a executive position they're a little more liberal even though they're not supposed to be supposed to treat everyone the same still leave hard you know rule more liberal with time off due to the all the extra hours executives put in
but the
i think pension costs are making it more and more difficult for them to provide per pension benefits too
it's
yes because it just keeps going an up and up there too
but there's
right
yeah
yeah my son has worked for a company for about six year he graduated from college what in eighty six so five years this fall
and he started out with they had a four o one k plan and he asked me if he should get into it and i said well very small amount you can put in there and you keep adding to it and they're going to match it or so and
all of a sudden at the end of last year he had a sizeable amount saved up in his four o one k plan just with the matching funds that the company is putting in and any earnings on investments
so
no he can't but he's only twenty seven years old and he's already got a good start
even if he changes companies he can you know roll that over into another plan
yeah
yeah
taking pride in the company you work for being able to say i work for such and such company or i hold such and such position with this company and that's one of the intangible fringe benefits i guess a certain ego level there
well it not the one i'm working for now but one i did in the past did so
i just felt you know
yeah
pay tuition and books or a portion thereof
yeah
oh what you can find there is so many of these things like working for a company some of the things they really enhance your experience in case you do have to change companies
if you do have to go and search for another position
it's right that's right
yeah
yeah
the company i used to be with also took care of things like professional dues and subscriptions to like the wall street and other professional man's magazines in the financial areas so it
there are there are more than just insurance and pension there's lots of other things that come up
back in the heyday of the economy before this recession then of course there were other things available to other people i never even took advantage of them of like
memberships in clubs people that had to entertain and such
so there's all sorts of fringe benefits
yeah
eh that's right it
it keeps your mortgage holder happy
it keeps your mortgage holder happy
yeah having to salary again being
being able to acquire the nicer things that you want not just have to live at a certain level being able to do things or purchase things
that you want that aren't really necessary
okay fine it's been nice talking with you
good-bye
well in our particular area we're not other than
they have a local store that you can take
bottles and
cans and different things to
in their parking lot and
in the winter we haven't been doing that but
they don't
that's about all they're doing
yes it's a rural area
uh-huh
um-hum yes so that's basically what happened up here and then with all the recycling the price of aluminum cans went down
yeah it used to be about sixty cents a pound and so people were collecting them and taking them in to
to get money for them now it's down to about nineteen cents a pound
yeah that's what's happened and i don't know if that's from recycling i understand it is but
here we do recycle our newspapers and give them to the scouts
and they they're able to make some money
that way
but i have a son in illinois who
receptacles where they put it in
they have some for the cans some for the bottles and newspapers
and then they have the regular garbage and
this truck comes before the garbage truck and picks
and has separate bins to put all the glass and the plastic and all that in
yes
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
well i've that's what they in the local paper here they were talking about that half about half the
the material in the dumps is newspapers
they could recycle that more than they do then
we'd be able to save a lot of trees and everything else so i've been i i'm all for it i just don't know
i know my son in chicago where he has this they have
they have to pay extra to have them pick it up even though and so that's kind of a burden on my
my son even though they put it in different containers they still have to pay extra money to do
and
yes they do
yeah um-hum
right
hm right
yeah
yeah it really does if we could just get people
all over to do it now i know in south of us about a hundred miles south in utah they do have a area where
they bring all the garbage in and they do have places to recycle and they really encourage this and you can bring it and you have different areas
that's a well it's next to provo utah i don't know if you're familiar with utah at all but
it's where brigham young university is this
there they seem to be having success and but it is a
it's done by the
it for profit making for these people
and they of course are
okay kate do you play golf
uh-huh
yeah
right
that's very similar to me
i just haven't taken the time to learn the fundamentals of the game i just go out and try to be joe athlete and think that i can just
you know use transfer skills from like you said softball or baseball
and i've got that baseball swing and i hook everything viciously so i have to aim like forty five degrees off to the to the right and hopefully it curves back in and usually i end up
going from one side of the fairway to the other and not straight down the middle
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh yeah
do you watch golf on tv a lot
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah i we don't have a tv so we don't watch much golf
yeah so we don't go out to the local golf course and watch amateurs very often so but you know when i was younger when i was into it i'd watch it
every now and then if baseball or basketball or something else wasn't on and golf was always the
the if nothing else is on i'll watch golf
because i don't know it's pretty it's neat watching i really enjoy watching the highlights like on espn sports center when they show the great shots and everything i mean that's fun but i don't i'm not up for watching the whole game like i do for baseball or basketball
yeah
huh
yeah so you've been in the gallery before
so who'd you follow
yeah
was it like a big name with a big gallery or was it one of the younger pros or something
yeah
yeah well yeah you're outdoors and you know it's kind of neat that's the only thing that's what draws me to golf is just you know being outside on a large wide open space pretty much
and well down here it's so expensive i'm from indiana and up there
i went to purdue and you have purdue golf course and if you're a student i mean you can play eighteen holes for like seven bucks
on a really you know it's a big ten championship course so it's really well kept and everything else but you know down here it's incredible i've
i've never golfed down here because it's you know nine holes for ten bucks or something and
and by the time i drill a you know a half dozen balls into a pond or something you know that's an extra five bucks right there and so
you know it gets kind of expensive for the young college graduate
uh-huh
yeah
has a subscription to golf magazine or something
that's funny
yeah so has he always been like that or just in the later years
yeah
yeah
um-hum
well if nothing else just get out there and rub shoulders with the boys
yeah
well that's neat
so you don't see you
taking up you know and charging being the avid golfer in the near future huh
oh volleyball
yeah
i've never really well sherman's a smaller plant but i've never really seen
uh-huh
yeah
well i know there just not that many places to play around here from what i hear there's a private club maybe one and there's
the local junior college has a golf course because it used to be an air force base so they've got the old air force base golf course and it's like
playing on dirt i mean there's no grass so you know it's not too many golfers like there are in dallas probably
with more courses and more people and probably higher money better kept
but
i don't know i'm just kind of glad my wife's kind of in to it she's she'll play in it about once or twice a year but that's about it
well if it's genetic you'd better be careful
likewise and maybe we'll get hooked up again sometime all right take care bye
well jim sounds like you're starting out on something new
so
what kind of aspect do you have as for as budgeting
um-hum
good
um-hum
well we've been married twenty years and i guess our budgeting is it's actually minimum and we've gone through period where we've needed to budget on quite formally but we've gotten to where we structure
right yeah i guess you know the situation i'm in
yeah
debits require more discipline
doesn't require the discipline to say oh yes that is due on this date and then make the appropriate trip to the bank or whoever and so actually we live in
it does make funds transfer and that kind of thing a lot more
readily available
um-hum
great
yeah
oh i would think you know i would think it did
um-hum
right
right
yeah
yeah and that's
it
it takes so long for a person to develop
of
hi this is judy i'm from maryland and i'm in california visiting right now
oh
okay
okay
okay
well actually that's what i was thinking too
and you know just to jump ahead a little bit but then we can back up is it perhaps women in politics is for the future
because i don't see that really yet
in positions of power really
ah
that's true that's true
do you work in private corporation or government
ah
um-hum
a government
and i work in academia before
and actually there's one woman in our i don't know what you'd call it institute who is a manager and i mean in a sense
perhaps
a lot of she gets protected a lot because it's almost like a token
and it's sort of unfortunate
because i think that they don't accept her technically and but she's a good paper pusher
and it's in a technical position really
and you know she should be more technical for what she does
and i think that's sort of unfortunate because it doesn't it doesn't really help the cause in the long run
but
you know i don't know and teaching i still see that that's where most of the women are
in teaching and you know and it's always been that way
right not well
uh-huh
um-hum not department chairmen
yeah not the deans and things like that
um-hum
hum
and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or just don't or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs
uh-huh
they're just not selected somehow
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
oh okay but i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering but you know i say that but yet i know two
yeah i'm sure there are
yeah
um-hum
yeah i mean the two that i know obviously are not in teaching but
i mean it's just because i'm in the humanities it's just
but
yeah it's
oh that's interesting
yeah
yeah i mean i suppose that it's difficult to really say why because
you know there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified
and maybe there aren't you know
right which could be you know partial partially cultural anyway
so that it might be circularly being the same problem of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway so why spend your time getting qualified
it's a rough a rough situation
and i guess what i what amazes me is
the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids or and in our case we actually have one father who works part-time a six hour day so that he can take the kids
kids or kid i'm not sure to school in the morning and be home
when the children or child comes home in the afternoon
this is
well see i don't know anything about the family but yeah i would imagine she might
because he's
you know he's a really nice guy but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job
so that maybe he you know maybe she was more qualified but still it's interesting that you know he he's been doing this evidently for a good number of years
and but it's unusual
uh-huh
yeah i
oh he was even before they had children
oh she was
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for
somebody to stay home that
yeah that's true
but yet you know we have to think about that because if she had opted to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything
so we're carrying our own prejudice
oh dear so
oh dear you know well i mean it it's an interesting topic yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of thought to but
in the past it's
one of those things that you know seems to happen
i don't i don't feel for the most part that i've been discriminated against
no i was a department chairman i but i don't like administration
so then i'm probably a poor example although you know i was an administrator and could still be i suppose
uh-huh
oh really
you were you were more ambitious than they would let you be
yeah
yeah well i would
oh jeez
yeah actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government at i was taken advantage of
and that's true that you know sometimes other people get higher increments
for you know even
right
right that's probably true i hadn't i hadn't thought about it because i do like what i do and i just sort of ignore the administrative part of it since i didn't like it when i had to do it
oh gee
well
since i don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic
um-hum
right
right they have to
right
well
how do you feel about setting like well for example a car type accident where
or some incident where someone loses a limb do you think that jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm a dollar figure for losing different body parts it
um-hum
hm
um-hum
yeah right
yeah
that's true
hm
oh out of their
as opposed to the insurance paying the bills
type thing
uh-huh well we're
who do they get they get insured they get insured from other insurance companies or how does that work
oh okay your talking about
sure
okay
well
but in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings
okay
um-hum
um-hum
right they don't
hm
sure
okay
well i grew up out in the country and was used to having guns around the place and i'm
i'm not for gun control in the strictest sense of the word
yeah
yeah
yeah well i feel that its i think the what was it the national rifle association had this bumper sticker a few years back if about if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns then
and i believe that too because the person that's wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun a knife a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with
and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns we can handle it but there's a element that can't
you have got them outgunned
there was a an article in the paper just this week where i think it's
one of the gun companies i can't remember which was developing a ten millimeter
automatic pistol for the fbi which would give them additional firepower it had held like a fifteen shot clip which would be able they would be able to put down anything that came at them
but if you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an uzi machine gun a thirty eight smith and wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good
yeah i have lived in illinois at one time and they passed a it wasn't really gun control but it was you had to register as a gun owner you didn't have to list your guns
but you had to have this card it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition
and that's the first this was twenty years ago but they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect
pardon
yeah uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
we lived in tennessee for awhile and i bought a pistol there and there was a fifteen day waiting period you had to fill out an application and go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted
and then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing
and no i think that you know a waiting period can make a difference but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that
so there's i don't think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because
right
yeah the again the purpose of gun control is to control how it's being used is what the purpose should be
it's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one
and i'm in favor of keeping the illegal guy from getting one in his hands but the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element
oh yes
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i know what i took my kids out and taught them how to shoot a gun my wife the same thing she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that i have an arsenal or anything but we have several guns around the house
but still i think they ought to know how to use one and it is not just a toy and that when
it's not like on tv when someone gets shot they get back up if someone gets shot with a real gun they don't get back up
yeah
yeah
yeah
i remember i had an old uncle up by tulsa oklahoma that took me out and showed me this was it was not my it was my mother's uncle this was a gentleman in his sixties
and he took me out with him and single shot twenty two and taught me how to shoot we went squirrel hunting and
and he taught me how to shoot an old single shot twenty two and i was probably about twelve at the time and i thought that was the neatest thing at first and uncle sam took me out took me hunting with him and he let me shoot and showed me how
right
well that's about all i we agreed pretty well on this i think so okay well it's been real nice talking with you okay bye
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah and i think that's basically my standpoint too is my dad and i've talked about this a lot and i just personally i think it's kind of i don't know we pay a lot
sometimes i know that it's not used very wisely
and i think the big thing for me and what my dad has said is we pay a lot but it's worth it to live in america i guess for our freedom
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
um-hum
yeah
absolutely
right
yeah
um-hum
and the sad thing i think personally you know i don't mind paying so much taxes if i'm getting what's due
but i think a lot of times what happens is you get into the government system and my dad works for the government in some ways and he works a lot with people who are paid by the government and there are so many things to quote unquote protect the employee
that you know you're not getting what you're paying for a lot of times whereas in any other business situation it'd be see you know
yeah
right
yeah and you got to walk that fine line i think one of the things that the government really could save a lot of money on is you know when it's for example in defense spending when it's something that you can use like an ashtray you know
and granted there's other things for example that you know a microwave or something if you're underwater you'd have to have some specific specifications but
but just to work out with our tax money you know watch where is it going to be best used and how is it going to be most effective cost wise
oh yeah
um-hum
yep
yeah
right
um-hum
right
yeah
and i agree with you there i think you know there there's nothing in my opinion from what i've seen and the people i've worked with some other countries and from our own country that
that would ever take the place of the freedoms and the things that we have here for me i you know i guess when it comes right down to it if it was living in a place
like mexico or russia that are really struggling both with the government and with economics i would prefer to pay my extra tax money here and
and have things the way they are
uh-huh
yeah
and i'd i played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go on the other hand they really decided themselves what kind of experience did you have
um-hum
um-hum
hm
i see i maybe i'm wrong but i think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of
his or her happiness and the appropriate support environment and things like that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
did you play a strong role in helping them pick schools or did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors and
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think that's a great idea i mean that
right it's it seems expensive at the time you're doing it but the compared to the total decision it's nothing
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
you know well back to this visiting thing i mean i found that my kids had no conception of what college was really like and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand
good grief what is twenty one thousand what school is that
uh-huh
um-hum
yes
um-hum
yes
um-hum
helps to at least set up range of things to look at
start
the well right now they've got a kind of a central location off of the main highway and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper
plastic
i think three bins for glass white green and whatever other combination there is and i think they've got a comp some kind of container for aluminum
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well that's good well rowlett had sent out a survey not too long ago in terms in how many people were interested in having a pick up
i guess on the days they do trash or something like that and apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably because they're going to do it i don't know how soon they're going to do it or
how organized it's going to be but they're supposed to initiate that some sometime in the next couple of months
i've never noticed that we don't have a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria
no there's only one pop machine and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now so mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
that's good
and i think they're trying to make some changes i noticed at the library or someplace this past month and a half ago they were having a speaker talk about
doing lawn work and how important it is to cut your lawn without a bag
just kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of all the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff
and it's i guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and
let it work it's way back into the soil
i saw part of that
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah well there are a lot of things that aren't i'm that's one of the things i wonder about one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else i wonder about some of the products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take
why they couldn't do more recycling with those
hum
yeah
true yeah i noticed that about things like i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and
and lawn additives and that type of thing but the cost is like double or sometimes triple what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy so in terms of that it's you know
for the environment it its there is good reason to do it the cost is kind of prohibited
uh-huh
yeah it's a good idea
uh-huh
yeah true
yeah
i i'd heard something stranger talk about bottles the other day on
on the radio station i think it's k l t y they were talking about the i think it's in canada they're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs
as a reinforcement for roads for road repairs
and apparently they don't break down very easily and
that type of thing
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well i think the more people are aware of it the more they'll do i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that
uh-huh
yeah
true
uh-huh
you do much fishing out there
did
well you know we moved from california we moved from northern california to come out here and i
we did quite a quite a bit of fishing out there but out here in texas it's all man made lake
oh is that right
oh
yeah well that's kind of the thing here in dallas and it's a whole different kind of fishing than
than i am use to in california i'm use to deep sea fishing out there and fishing off the pier and stuff and out here in dallas you have to use lures and
all kinds of different things i haven't had a chance to go out fishing much here but i use to do a lot of fishing out in california
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
wow they did a lot of salmon fishing up there then
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah it is and the bait that they use is totally different in california than it is here in texas and
you know we use to use live bait in california and they do use some live bait here but not a not whole lot not like you know you use to use in california and
yeah how many kids do you have
two
wow you got two little ones then huh well i have got four i have got a twelve year old an eleven and
six and a three
so
oh that's we use to have a lot of fun when i was actually my two boys were born here in texas but
my two girls i use to take them with me when we would go fishing you know and my wife and i use to like fishing off the pier and stuff and we'd catch shoot one time she caught a couple of sharks off the pier
and you know we caught what do you call those flat things
and we you know we'd get crab and stuff off the pier and
that's stuff that we that we miss being here in texas we don't have much of a chance to get out to the coast and
yeah my wife loved to fish she didn't like to she doesn't like to put the bait on but
it's funny now you know i'd we would get two poles
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well that's my wife
oh is that right
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my heck
oh that's funny
uh-huh
now do you like eating fish
is that right
uh-huh
yeah i'm a little bit
sesame street yeah we've had that one before
and i don't presently subscribe to any i think we've i've subscribed to sports illustrated and
i think we've taken sesame street actually before and
yeah
uh-huh
you do you do you read it all the way through how often does it come out
yeah
oh yeah huh
oh well that's the best kind oh we've i've had sports illustrated we've had national geographic when it was free my mother got that for us it was free so we and
but i guess i found i like reading them but i never seem to because see the sports illustrated's weekly
and it and i just didn't seem to have time to sit down and read it
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
huh you have a whole collection from the gulf war
well that's a good idea
yeah do you get life every month
no
yeah when it looks interesting yeah
i haven't gotten a copy of that in well actually i don't know i my parents used to take it and when it was weekly
and that was i used to read it all the time then and i really haven't looked at it much since it went monthly except in the grocery line picking it up and looking at the pictures in it looked interesting
oh yeah those the tabloid things oh
does he really and you and you fess up to it huh
isn't that funny huh
really
yeah i glance at them in line but the stories are so ridiculous you know i mean
right seven year old gives birth to twins and
ninety nine year old elopes with ten i mean you know i just huh
um-hum i read the newspaper like every day and i guess
as i was thinking about it before the what i guess i like about the magazines is the they'll cover the same material sort of
but more in depth and more thought out and more the whole picture instead of just you know one little
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
say it sounds like you read quite a bit really yeah
yeah just about i mean i'll pick up when i'm going somewhere i'll pick up a people and usually a sports illustrated and occasionally i'll go to the library and
and you know they have all the current ones every week and i'll sit down and read them read them there
yeah
well i i've got teenage kids so i you know they're usually there doing stuff and i'm and not ready to leave at the appointed hour so i end up i end up sitting you know while
what do you think
um-hum
um-hum
i know in the large cities we think that we have more crime but
and so i don't know that it's confined just to the large cities
but we found that
the crime rate in the country increased when they had let loose some early parolees
and that concerned me because i was hoping letting the people out of prison early on for good behavior would work but i about decided it didn't
but
i think sometimes it depends on what space they need
yeah
do you think that has as much to do with the rising crime rate as the beginning of the of the gangs and things
oh yes
i see what you mean
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum or maybe don't feel as responsible to anyone for their actions
um-hum
well do you think that with the recession that everyone says is coming along and more women don't find work and have to stay home and the economy goes down do you think that would help
deter the crime raise and increase raising of families
um-hum
um-hum
well i see an awful lot of working parents who very involved in their children
and
i don't know i know it's hard especially to monitor television if you're not around
but
um-hum
um-hum
i have a friend who's a principal in school and she said that a lot of the parents that she calls they just flat don't wanna be bothered
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah i guess i basically agree that do you think it's okay for a company
to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i have once too so
yeah
i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to want to work for them
to do this and i'm just like well i'm not even going to think much about it
if you're gonna treat me with this much respect even before
you've gotten to know me
yeah well like you say i mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing
i mean the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
and i mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons
yeah
well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this or
yeah
hum
i tend to view it
even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend
an employer's rights as opposed to an in addition to an individual's rights but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
and if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that
um-hum
now are you are you talking about the elected people or are you talking about others um-hum
yes
um-hum
sometimes called the dismal science
uh-huh
yes
um-hum
um-hum
yes
yes
um-hum
right so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists i mean right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say
love that make them all no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
so you talk about jeopardizing the future would you be against any deficit spending
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
but what practical steps could one take
well but everybody will say that he is for that
and how will you make that actually happen
um-hum
um-hum
yep
sounds like a good idea
nothing escapes right no deductions nothing just ten percent
yep
right
yep so that that's it that's i mean i agree with that that's a good idea and is it your expectation that would raise the total revenues collected or lower them or what
krld
yeah
yeah
i don't usually watch the news at night time because i'm you know just got home ready for dinner and all that and by the time i get done with dinner it's already over and
yeah
what do you think i don't know that's pretty strange
yeah you know i mean like with regard to the soviet union we're telling the
soviets you know hey the baltic states wanna separate go ahead and let us separate that'll be good you know what if the american south wanted to separate like they tried to do in eighteen sixties would we be so forgiving and say ah sure go ahead form your own country
and the other countries that wanna separate they wanna get away from all that garbage the soviet union i don't blame them either
that's something that they got to work out for themselves we shouldn't be involved in that we shouldn't even be talking about it you know the government should just stay away from them people and just let them figure out for themselves what they need to do
yeah bush should not do anything but as for the rest of but though i don't you know we get the paper on the weekend
and
yeah
i do that all everyday so that's another way but that's mainly you know that doesn't have like a whole lot just a few things on there which is
huh
i didn't see it
is that right is that up
wow
the building i was in guess you work for ti too
i guess you work for ti too
oh
yeah you got surplused i got surplused last year myself yeah
yeah
another organization yeah
they needed somebody just like me whereas before i was not even doing what i was supposed been doing but that's not that's not the topic i guess but
yeah
it did quite a bit better
yeah
oh gosh
yeah
you know thank goodness general dynamics got that big contract because that'll least bring some money to the area
general dynamics and lockheed and boeing
lockheed boeing on this
yeah but lockheed i used to work for lockheed and at the time i was there they were developing the prototype for the that fighter
and so it was pretty big stuff there then now they got the contract for it so
well they're in partnership with lockheed and boeing yeah it's a it's a threesome
no mcdonnell douglas lost out they lost the contract they were in partnership with northrop and they lost the contract and so
yeah
probably sell to somebody who wants to pay for i don't know
yes have a good day bye
well i don't know about you but i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks
and i'm ready for it to come back
well not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was like sixty five when we woke up and sixty six
and today and i when i got up the temperature said more like of course seventy nine or eighty
so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather
you don't are you a summer person
well i have a friend who's the same way and anything below sixty she's just not happy but i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in plano we really don't have as many seasons as the
my husband's from nebraska and they have more of the four seasons
oh you're used to that too
you don't like the cold well i usually like it about sweater weather and the problem here in plano is it doesn't last very long it goes from hot and then you get a couple of weeks of that indian summer and then it's cold
and i wish it were several months of that
oh yeah
well sure it does that kind of schedule you really need a lot more sunshine
and also the evenings are going to be getting darker sooner
because as it gets cooler
but i did a walk last night and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler
and i still think so but then this summer we went to orlando for a week and it was so humid there
yes i do not like the
um-hum
yeah i think so too i know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains but it seems like here i would like it to rain and then be over and then not rain for a while it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that's all it does
so but i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like i guess my best would be probably
sixty eight when you wake up or sixty six and then probably seventy five during the day
yeah are you do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds
yeah so
yeah
well i do too i do too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of
yeah
we do too i think a lot of people agree the same
uh-huh now there have been worse summers in fact this morning when they were talking about harold taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder
of the summers
and milder fall everybody seems to be you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're just
melting and then you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings and we'll it'll be too cold and they'll say well those are the ones that like the cold weather
oh yeah he did he did it was it was really a shame he didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did
it's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes
oh is that right okay
oh good
hello did i reach the dallas area
yeah that's what
my name is fernando
hey how's it going do you work for ti
north carolina state university
yep
i'm getting a master's in computer science and computer engineering
i took a voice io course
well one of my teachers went to a to this conference up in bethesda maryland
and so he saw it there and he just said you guys want to make some money and talk five minutes a day here you go so
not originally
argentina
yeah
well i used to live up in new york and maryland and i like i like bigger cities i like i like more populated areas because i used to live in buenos aires but they have ten million people
but this area is nice it looks like it's got a lot of job opportunities especially at research triangle park
and so it looks it looks well it's the third largest growing area in the country for businesses
yeah
no north carolina state
yeah no the wolf pack
yeah no we're not we're not the tar heels
why do you run
oh okay my dad is too
yeah it's nice
yeah
it's clothing
right how you how you dress to go to work and how it changes from season to season
and from day to day
okay
okay ready i'm going to press the one
no then we say bye and i
well i got a stopwatch here
so i'll probably say you know it's like well we've been talking for five six minutes so okay
well we'll just open it okay i'll press the one ready
because it's more comfortable for me but you know it's like when you're in school you either wear sweatpants or jeans
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh okay
well
because how hot i mean like in the coldest that it gets in winter down there how much is it
yeah that's
well it's basically you know it's like i got like a leather jacket or a you know so i just put on a t-shirt and a leather jacket and i usually stay in class that way and if not i would wear a sweatshirt underneath it
and then you know you'd but what happens is what i've seen here on campus it's very strange because a lot of black people here they wear like dress pants and dress shirts to go everywhere
okay
and they wear either that or they wear dress pants and black turtlenecks or white turtlenecks
and so the thing is you know is like i asked a guy you know why do you wear that he goes well it costs me the same amount which is true because some dress pants you know cost me twenty five dollars which is the same as jeans
which is
yeah
where at
where at
oh okay
yeah
yeah
but the thing is when you started with ti was it as big as a company as it is now
yeah
yeah which is which is i mean when hello
you probably got wait calling
okay
well i guess i'm supposed to talk alone while he's on the wait call about clothing right
so i don't know what to say i don't wear any clothing
we're at nudist camp we don't wear any clothes here
yeah oh that's okay
yeah
was that in the seventies
no but when it had gone up
yeah i
i sort of remember that i'm only twenty two but in the seventies i heard you know ti was even making those little watches you know those led watches that you couldn't see in the sun
yeah
so
yeah
well they said that women like the you know executive women or women that work whatever they spend five hundred dollars on clothes a year so but for me
yeah i mean women go all i mean what i've seen like you know they like to wear something different every day and for me it's like people know how i dress and we have you know like the gym here
they give you shirts right which you use and then you take back they give you a clean one
and so sometimes you wear you know the shirts from the gym everyday of the week the only thing is that you can tell them apart because they have the year that they were bought in
so i mean you don't feel as bad because it's like they give you different year sometime you know so you're wearing you know sometimes you're wearing eighty nine the other times you're wearing ninety one the other times you're wearing you know eighty six so it's okay you know
right see when we take pe you have to dress in the in pe clothes but it it's issued to any one that wants one that's in the university
well right now since i'm graduating i'm
well why don't you tell me about your lawn and gardening
do you do you have a large lawn
uh-huh
yeah no i've got other things that i like to do and that's not my favorite
i don't know out there sweating in the sun you know and pulling weeds and those stuff
yeah
yeah and i won't mow the lawn either and you know watering the lawn is a pain in the butt because we don't have a an electric system so
or sprinkler system i should say so
yeah
well what do you like to do when you garden
oh so you actually grow vegetables
well that's nice
uh-huh
yeah
you know you get into buying as many plants that you need to make it look good and you know you can't just buy two or three you've got to buy a dozen for one small area
you know so
exactly and i know we've got this spring we've got to push pull a bunch of stumps out because they're
they kicked the bucket so
well that means we'll just have to put something else
and so but you know we haven't we hadn't had any freeze damage this year of course because it hasn't been that cold i guess it's been about the same with you all
yeah and i
and the rain is unbelievable i mean it's just
we got a few a few flakes last week
just enough to make it look you know i mean it didn't even of course settle you know on the ground but it looked pretty while it was coming down
yeah what about you
yeah
uh-huh
that's true that's true ours are well they're kind of dormant they're pretty mellow right now
yeah
in fact i just had a garden company come by and give me a well you know one of those places that fertilizes your lawn give me an estimate because i just don't want to go out and buy all the chemicals and stuff because i don't know what you need for this weed versus this weed versus this weed
so i just let them treat all my weeds and i won't have to deal with you know buying this stuff and having it sit in the garage
well yeah it's better for us because we don't we have a pretty small lawn
so and you know the cost i think per time is a little less than thirty bucks so
i don't think they do the ants i think they're just dealing with the weeds
no because we've got a real problem they're overtaking everything
so but i mean we got some good grass but it's getting you know
exactly it's getting choked out
well i think we covered it don't you do you know anything else you want to talk about gardening
you still have onions growing
oh
so do you go give them away that you have so many
you use them pretty much yourself
well that's good
uh-huh
so the green onions the green onions grow into the
the bigger onions
wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that stuff fades away though right
uh-huh
uh-huh so it doesn't i mean it doesn't compete with the regular grass or anything
uh-huh
well do you think i mean i wonder the assumption is that it is a problem and i've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though i have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem
and but it's not clear to me that it is
it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions but if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way
you know in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem
um-hum
i mean i assume that those who don't vote i mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that and i assume that they would vote differently
if they were voting than your average voter but i don't know if that's the case in fact i've heard of studies that suggest that isn't
but it's funny because here in california things are getting increasingly democratically oriented in the sense of people being able to vote for things i mean we have these initiatives state initiatives now
the first really popular you know wide spread one was proposition thirteen which was a tax revolt against property taxes
and you know now we're and that was whatever ten years ago and now we're up to proposition hundred and fifty or something like that i mean we've just
there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked being asked to make decisions
on topics that would have three different competing
proposals and you had to vote for you know yes or no on each of them and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them and it was incredibly complicated and difficult
and a lot of people revolted against that they said we don't want to have to decide all these things yeah that's why we hire people who you know to make these decisions for us
yeah
i do too
i don't know it's interesting some countries voting is obligatory it is in australia for example yeah
yeah
well australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the united states and it's not for me to say that they're not they feel i mean here you have the right to vote and they simply define it as a duty there
you know we have just as we have a duty to pay taxes
you know is that democratic i mean we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country we have the duty to pay taxes and in that country it's a duty to pay taxes and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent
and it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic
yeah
yeah and some people don't vote i mean there is like three or four percent of australians don't vote and i think they're eligible for a fine i don't know if they actually are fined or what happens
but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote
uh-huh
yeah i sort of see
well i that's how i feel i mean if you if you vote and your guy looses well you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote i sort of feel like
part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you know and certainly that's true in the overall i mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole i sort of feel that way
they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that and you know i say well
you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important
i mean it's funny because technically you do i mean you have the right to do a write in candidate but of course that's not really a vote
yes it really doesn't and
so it's a complicated situation but i would like to see i don't know i
i'm thinking of actually moving to australia and perhaps i'll call you back and let you know what how the australian system works i mean not because of the i mean i'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting but just because of a job opportunity and i
i
no i'm not
and so i'm really quite curious how that would work to have both i mean you know and i believe in the in a certain soviet block countries you are obliged to vote too in fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently
and
that's what i think of when i think of you're obliged to vote but when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system
i don't know i kind of part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty
um-hum
uh-huh well that's a thought
yeah that's see that's an example of a right not a not a actually that's considered a privilege not a right
yeah but technically people most people technically it's a privilege but most people think of it as a right i mean in other words if the government denies you
driving denies you a drivers license people get very upset but actually it's a privilege which is allowed to be revoked
and fortunately voting isn't that
republic documents when they were arguing through constitutional law written by hamilton and all those people oh i think it was hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican
not in the sense of the republican party now versus a democratic government and arguing successfully why the united states should be a republic not a democracy
which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy
where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and a republic is people vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues so as you vote for representatives
and the whole idea was
presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy
because just as you can have a tyranny of a single you know bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority
and he makes a very passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process because anytime you have a majority
they can change the law in a fully democratic process and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case
yeah well i mean i feel that
my you know
yeah well their job is to be reelected by in large and so they work on that job
and there's also an antigovernment mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars and they're all fools and you know throw the bastards out that kind of thing and there's a notion that somehow
if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange because i mean if i'm hiring a plumber i want a real plumber i want someone trained in it i'm very like
nancy do you have any children
um-hum
well that's nice
that is lucky well how old does a child have to be before you have to you get to stop making arrangements for him i wonder
um-hum uh-huh
well and it's nice for them not to be alone
uh-huh
that is a rule
oh no
yes
she is
well i'm glad you had that opportunity to have your mom
well i have two kids and five and six a girl and a boy and so far i haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because
i'm at home now full time but when i was going to school i would go to school a time that my husband wasn't you know when he was at home
so that we would just switch back and forth like that but it's really scary and i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care
um-hum
no
um-hum
well that's nice
and i know that i have done some babysitting myself
and when i was in school and needed extra money and i know how i feel how i felt as a provider of child care that even though you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to
you know treat them equally and you know better usually better than your own it's not the same and it made me realize that no one will love your child as much as you and your mother your
and the family and no one will look out after them and i just think
so far i think my preference would be rather than to have like a
oh a big day care that what is that like kindercare and things like that rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something
i would prefer to have in home care either my own home or a neighbor or something
uh-huh
right
it is hard
no
no
and i know when i pick my kids up from school they wanna come home and i and i would hate for them to be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation
um-hum
no
well that's true because even now when they're gone to school it seems like there's just not enough time left over in the day
and by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time and there's just not enough to time in the day to do anything good quality for them
but that's really
and the last time that we tackled it i did the kitchen
and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark it was called a sassafras it was kind of an orangish brown
it was not real pretty anyway so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color
covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets and know if i look underneath my cabinets i'm not satisfied with the jobs i did on it because there're splotches
but i'm glad it's done because it's brighter
oh lord
uh-huh
oh yeah
so what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried
uh-huh
and it's not scratching your floor because it's so thick oh that's pretty good we painted every room in this house some of them like two three times we have two children
and i haven't figured out how to get that off i guess i'll have to take that door down and really get it good
and then we have a two story we did the outside of it one summer that was horrendous i mean i couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder i could get up on the roof and do that
but i dread that the next time
uh-huh
no i wouldn't think so have you guys tackled your ceilings yet
oh we got to do that this summer we're dreading it
now have you thought about this that wherever you buy your paint you need to make sure that store's not likely to go out of business
uh-huh
oh but i still feel good the minute i put that paint on even if it has got a dent in it i do
oh what else can i tell you about painting oh i get it all in my hair too do you do that
spots in it
are you having to repair the walls at all
that's smart
so where do you live
i'm in garland
could you try to call this weekend
to that switchboard did you keep getting that it was down
you didn't
yeah
well i've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a
surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything i don't know i can't think of anything else to say about painting
it hurts your back and it hurts your arm
yeah
but you're glad you're doing it right
uh-huh do you have one of those straight edge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards
on your baseboards
you don't have any carpet down in your house
see we've got carpet and
i haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it on down so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it
you can't hold it there until it's dried
the whole thing
did the framing and all
huh
maybe you and i should get together because when i had my last big project i had the contractor do the framing and i did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
yeah
my wife wishes i hadn't done that
i think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy
yeah
did you framed it in on you framed in new square footage or was it stuff that was already brand new so
uh-huh
do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground
on the piers
did
you had those poured or you did them yourself
you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete
huh
no i designed it from scratch and did a did a pretty good job those are nice though they're pretty forgiving you know you can always tear stuff out and redo it it's a
yeah
i've
i built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and a backrest and all that stuff i'm
yeah we had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes so we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm four by four posts and
and then the rest of it i just did a contractor friend helped me with some of the foundation work but it's pretty it was about four or five hundred square feet the same size as the addition that i just put on so
yeah
yeah
i'd be surprised if it wasn't cheaper where you are well yeah it probably comes from where you are
most
when i drive through that area that's all i see is
pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards yeah
uh-huh
right east texas
huh
yeah my current project is a walkway which i'm building around the house and out to the backyard to you know
digging it out and laying sand and putting pavers on top of that so that's a lot easier
kind of younger still and we do a lot of activities with them how about your kids
are your are your sons still live in the area
well
i've got one son and one daughter and i think the activities haven't changed because my son is in scouts
and the orchestra and the choir and
ballet and church activities and soccer and basketball and baseball and my daughter is on the swim team is in ballet
takes piano lessons is in the girl scouts so tends to be very busy
well gives them the opportunity to you know to relate to other people and not only to learn a specific skill and how to apply it but more importantly how to you know work within the larger context
oh yes i coached this year i've coached soccer i've coached baseball i'm a assistant scout master in the scouts i've actually
appeared on stage with them in their ballet performances and then a feel of things so it's a
it's pretty active and my wife teaches piano and she's active with the girl scouts so
takes a tremendous amount of time
well the ones in trouble the ones that are bored that's their biggest problem is boredom if they
well sure
like last night we went to hear my son play in the
orchestra then last week we heard him sing in the choir twice so you know we're
well my son's
eleven my daughter's ten
well i've got a long way to go
so cathy what do you do in the way of lawn and garden work
i don't know exactly what that is
i don't
yeah i live in an apartment
it turns brown yeah
guess it freezes and everything so
so does that mean you have to replant each year or
i see
no i'm actually from
and grew standard things like corn beans and we had some trees apple trees fruit trees you know and apple trees and
oh yeah
did lots of canning and
we even
made an annual trip out to eastern washington
yakima area to get
uh-huh
oh yeah i enjoyed
working in the garden
my dad was a big
fan of organic gardening
yeah
yeah and
always picked a different place in the garden to dump it out
had our own rototiller and
rough even though it was a large plot we used a rototiller for the whole thing and so that was quite a bit of work for all of us but we five kids and
six kids altogether
actually dad did more than his share but we always had our assignments to help out
so and mom did very little of the gardening although she did most of the canning and other things
oh to eat oh
the our big crops were
green beans and corn and i guess i liked the corn
corn on the cob huh
i just
i
i'm working at the university of iowa
on a post doctoral fellowship i just graduated
out west with a phd in physics
brigham young university
yes and
so are you originally from texas
i see
did your family have a farm or were you more in the city
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah my wife is from southern california and their family has a an orange tree and a lemon tree out back
and they grow a few things they tomatoes and stuff but not they don't have very you know just a small backyard so there's not too much else they could do there
all right well how do you use credit cards carol
yeah
uh-huh
is that from past bad experiences in the past or just the fact that you don't want to be tempted
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
okay
uh-huh
but like if you'd take a trip or something
yeah
yeah do you
do you order a lot of things over the phone or credit card orders never
huh
so like if you go to k wal-mart or something you always pay in cash or with a check
cash
-kay
so your money funnels directly into your checking account huh
okay
me i have a discover card and i use that
when gas prices are the same whether you use cash or credit i usually use my discover card and i can let my money sit in the bank for an extra
because they pay in our credit union pays at the end of the month on your balance so i will let it sit and then draw interest from that and then i'll pay my credit cards off in full every month
so you know i have no finance charges as long as i pay off exactly on time which i do
and also discover card gives you a little bit of money back it's not much but you know five or six bucks instead of writing a check for a large purchase if i'm disciplined enough i can
like buying a suit if i spend like three hundred bucks you know i'll get some of that back through the
cash back program and also at the end of the month you know i'll get my interest on that three hundred bucks that was sitting in my checking account that would be gone had i written a check
and i do that sometimes but like when we go to the like i'd say it's about fifty writing a check or using the discover card
it just i don't know for some reason it just if it's something small i don't want to write a use my credit card but that's the only one i have and sometimes we order things through the mail like books and
which is i just if they have a toll free number i'll call it up and you know charge it to my credit card as long as
you know i'd make myself pay on time every time so there's no finance charge and
it's really you know like you said some people go off half wild and spend they think because they've got a thousand dollar limit then you know they've got to get that limit every month or something and they end up paying
finance charges and they just and then they'll pay the minimum balance every month and then end up they may have got something on sale but all the interest you know they end up paying more than what they would have had they just paid cash for it
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
huh
wow
what you override
what's that mean
oh okay
okay i see
yeah is that a free service that override
huh
huh
yeah
it's
right
yeah
it's just it's just so easy when
so you actually see how much you're spending
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah no kidding
i complain every time i mean we've only had to do it twice since my wife and i've been married in nine months is use the machine that charges and it charges a buck and one time it was because the machine at ti was broken
and we had to have cash so we had no choice but to go to the other place and the other one was just this weekend when we just
we were leaving out of town and we had to you know just have some cash and so we used the automatic teller card but you know i'm very chintzy with my money i don't like to spend lose a dollar just because i use a machine or something it's
senseless
yeah that's
yeah
yeah
really
their own tom thumb card
that's funny
uh-huh
huh
yeah
right
yeah it seems a lot more places are taking it now which when i first got it was a problem with it i said i don't want to use the credit card and i just carried it with me like you said for identification and sometimes when i would take it go on a trip you know it
they want cash or a major card so i went ahead and got that and there's no fee no service fee for it
plus they play pay you cash back at the end of the i think i earned probably eight or nine bucks last year which isn't very much but i'd just started to use it and
and like i had some major purchases i just was dumb and forgot to put on there like i wrote a check for my wife's wedding ring which was a lot of money and if i would have put it on the discover card
the money you know could have sat in the savings account or the checking account for an extra month and it also would have paid me probably you know eight or nine bucks back
on the end of the year thing so i messed that up so i you know i'm still not in it's not a good habit to use it but fortunately i'm not
like some people not a spendthrift and i really have to think about my purchases and i know if i have money in the checking account to cover it
then i i'll use the discover card you know to get a little more interest
but
that i graduated high school and i still didn't even i couldn't put together a map of the united states
you know what i mean and yet i felt that i got a good education and i did well in school but you tell me to name you know
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah
did you go through a public school system or a private
like in what sense
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
they'll have to bring somebody with them and they will show that they completed four years of high school yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application
they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves
it's just incredible
really
i know they i forget i think it's
because they're having budget problems they're closing the libraries
you're so you're a senior now
oh good for you that's great is nc university is that state what'd you say
um-hum i see
well pretty soon it's gonna get to the point where no one's gonna be able to afford to send their kids to college or to go to college
it's just outrageously expensive
oh is it well still though i mean you know thousands of dollars
oh well that's good that's good i went to a private university and
i don't know i look back now and i think that i probably would've done it differently if i you know could do it over again but
i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or
didn't even go to school some of them and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did
i really do and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say but i don't know i what
i went to brandeis university it's in massachusetts
i really felt like i've been working now for about four years
and i feel like what i've learned working is a hundred times more valuable than what i learned in school
and i know that i'm drawing a lot on what i learned in school you know i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on -earned but
and if you want to you know you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission like no hitting you know no pulling hair or anything like that
even some of the teachers that work there i think they don't value that type of student as much as you get in some
yeah it's true um-hum
and i don't know if it makes them feel better i mean do teachers get mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking somebody that wasn't as successful
and seeing what they could do versus somebody that you know did excel in areas and just watching them get better you know that's not much of a challenge
but
oh yeah
oh is that north carolina oh okay
no i don't know that area
i don't know it
oh really well the way i pick the final four was by the state that had the warmest climate
so that's how i chose all mine so you can tell that i didn't really have
that much to do with any of it
i know
hi debbie how are you
what do you think of this weather
oh i love it
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i have a four year old and a one year old
so yeah i'm glad it was nice too i
got a chance to go outside and
just have a nice day
the i remember last year wasn't it raining a lot this yeah all that flooding and everything
i'm glad we don't have that this year so far
uh-huh
we live just north of trinity mills and it floods there you know
quite a lot it's not it doesn't usually damage any businesses or anything but you can't get off of thirty five to
or target for that matter now
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah we're not from texas either
we're i grew up in pennsylvania so
yeah it it's not like this in pennsylvania
yeah
oh you're kidding
sure
oh i'm sure
i think you would probably
down here yeah i'd i think it's a necessity
we
we have
i guess we bought that my car in colorado that's where we moved from and
it's almost a luxury
we didn't have air conditioning in our house or anything
oh
yes it does
no i don't think so either no
oh no we didn't even have any of the famous dallas ice storms
uh-huh
oh
oh my gosh
well you know we lived in colorado for
four years i guess
so and we you know we had a lot of snow and i really don't miss that
my husband says he certainly doesn't mind
i don't know
yeah oh definitely
uh-huh
that's right
it doesn't matter right
colorado wasn't bad for that because it is so at least in colorado springs where we lived it was so sunny most of the time
that at right after it snowed it would almost always be a bright sunny day
and all of the roads would be clear you'd still have the snow on the yard
the kids could play in it but it'd be a bright sunny day and you know it would it would melt and you could drive around and it was really no big deal
yeah
really
that's
but we i don't know i don't really miss the snow i miss the change of seasons myself
the fall is what i really miss from pennsylvania
nothing pretty about it
um-hum
my folks don't live in pennsylvania anymore but for a long time i would purposely go back and visit in october
just so i could see the trees and the fall and such a pretty time
uh-huh
it really is and i think you don't
i growing up there i just assumed that's how it was all over the country i never really realized it was such a local
thing i
yeah
nope
yeah i do too i'm ready to
seems to even my one year old it really changes her temperament she can be in here all grouchy and
put her outside and hey she's fine
um-hum
my son he was born in colorado and when we first moved here
he was three i guess just turned three
and for the first week we were here it was over a hundred every single day it was in july
and he was lethargic he really he wasn't used to the heat at all he
he certainly doesn't like the heat but he doesn't become lethargic anymore
uh-huh
really hot
well it's been good talking to you
hopefully we'll have some more good weather but
we'll see
all righty bye-bye
and how did it go
jeez it's like starting over i guess
oh
you've got an older house
they built a little bit more sturdy than
right
oh is that right
yes
and just start at square one
huh
everything went all right
right
yeah
right
well ah probably the last thing i did was paint and wallpaper kids room
and i learned i used the wrong kind of paint this wasn't must have not been a very good quality because it just hasn't
stood up very well
it was a latex plaint paint it was flat and i wonder if maybe i should've used the gloss
but they say you use your gloss mainly in your
kitchens and things like that
yeah but i think maybe i don't know if it was just the
well it is a latex paint but it just kind of is so you know so it's supposed to wash you're supposed to be able to wash it
it's kind of got
oh you do mix the color as far as
you start with white and then they add the color you know what i'm saying but
yes right and then i wallpapered a couple of walls and
but the dye lots must have been a little bit different from first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if you're trying to match a design and i
yes that's what i needed and i didn't think about that i got a mickey mouse print is what i got and so a lot is wasted
and i
no i didn't is that how you're supposed to do
i started at one edge and went over
then you had to cut around the closet
and cut around a window
but
and start right there
it seem to get it straighter is that the advantage or what's the
okay now when you babysit what age group children do you sit with
uh-huh
i'd think so
uh-huh
now was this a one parent or two parent family
one parent how much time did she spend with them
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
and what are you studying
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well that certainly can happen now if you say you're in communications what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to
public relations so you would have a job with a company
rather than radio or television or newspapers or what have you
and then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home and with or stay with the children
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that that's is an advantage of being in the education field i spent thirty four years in education
yes and so oh i started out with college and then went to high school and then i preferred the high school age level much better than i did the college because you have a closer relationship with the students but
that i taught physical education
uh-huh
well i found that it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time
and it worked out fine from that standpoint plus the fact that when i left
usually my husband was seldom home for maybe forty five minutes or so and then our son he had to get on the bus and he did get on the bus it was his responsibility and he never ever thought
of not going to school he said in view of the fact that
he was certain i had a hot line to his school because i well i was in physical education then and i just kept getting pushed into administration wound up in administration
and so he thought surely that i or i would have bought a hot line to know if he ever skipped school which of course was not the case and i wouldn't have checked on him however there are there are points
both directions in that from the standpoint of parents working and not working
i listened to more than one parent say i don't know what this child wants i'm working two jobs they each have their own television they each have their own telephone they each have their own rooms they each have this they each have that
i'd say but what they don't have is you
absolutely and acting out because that is the way of getting attention
that's right
huh
uh-huh
right
and we certainly we need more of that we need more parents willing to supervise though we've had such a breakdown in the family structure from the standpoint of church and school and everything along the way
and that i think has contributed much to the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we're having
that the students parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very beginning and i think
my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one two and three to get the students off to a good start let them have positive
experiences from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and keep going and not wait until they're in the ninth and tenth grades it's too late then you cannot reverse that trend at that point
right and while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point and that is just as valuable
at that time as to the rush in the elementary yes right
right and the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something we were fortunate in view of the fact that
my son did play football and i did keep statistics for his team and his dad did take movies of the football
team and movies of the basketball team and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time
so i feel that i learned a great deal from my students
with regard to
what their biggest complaints were with parents and a thing such as one of the biggest complaints i well remember because i spent a lot of time with seniors was
caring their parents say when i was your age i didn't have this or that and i know i never ever said that because i knew that was one thing that was really irritating to young people
yes and i had to deal with their problems and i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had
just in general aspect and our son would share this and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of lines
so that i think he benefited from my experiences
no
no he works for a different company yeah in the dallas area but when he went away to and he was on an allowance
from the time he was in the seventh grade and a small allowance and all the way through college and he held three jobs
while he was in college and we didn't even know it he didn't even tell us that he had three jobs but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account
and we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go if he got married he was on his own if he flunked out he was on his own
no we haven't had any since oh just before christmas
and we got a lot before christmas the ski resorts were really excited and but now
we have we've had fog for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion so but no snow
the snow's all melted off the mountains
uh-huh
i guess there there's different parts of the state of utah that does have some but not usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts and they're down between thirty eight and
forty inches
this time of the year and we've been in a drought for the last five years this is the sixth year
and it's getting quite serious as far as water next summer
right
oh well that's different isn't it
flooded out
yeah my son in plano he lives fairly close to there's quite a wash that goes down through plano
and there's walking trails on both sides a walking path and when i've gone down to visit him i've gone on that but that was clear full and up to up to some of the streets i guess it just
um-hum
that's funny that we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much
seems
it's not a doesn't get that cold i guess huh
yes
uh-huh
yes
right
yeah we're kind of used to that here in utah of course there are mountains and i fly into montana a lot and we have a
the mountains are really high and a lot of places we go into you just kind of it's in the little valley but
and i sure hope we really need the moisture i hope we can get some there's supposed to be a storm but it split went down through northern arizona and southern utah and
they're not predicting any for the next week anyway up here so
some of it went to the south and some to the north up into montana so that just left us we got a high pressure
system that's just been sitting in here and we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had you know airport's been shut down till about noon everyday and they seed the clouds or seed the fog to try to
to get the airplanes in and out
um-hum
y'all been pulling them up huh or just loosening them until the rain came in
are you in the section of texas that's been getting so much rain
oh okay
yeah
so you're probably what about halfway -cross the state from san antonio though aren't you
yeah
yeah
okay
but you're still getting a good bit of the rain though
yeah
yeah is it asphalt shingles or clay
yeah
we were in campus apartment buildings with flat top
not too much they're just tar and gravel treated flat top roofs have you got pretty low pitch on that roof or is it pretty steep
well what do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal
yeah i imagine
i imagine
anyway
yeah that would be just too much of a fall for me
have you been visit was the house reasonably new or you been doing some remodeling work on it or
that's pretty new house yet
yeah
yeah
it's settling unevenly
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
well that sounds like a lot of fun
hm what is it like stucco walls or
or
wood
all drywall
wood framing
okay
give it a textured sort of a look and made for kind of a hard shell on the on the drywall
well that's good
yeah
well that would that would be in terribly exasperating to have the
a slab floor like that swelling and giving like that
crime is our subject
have you ever been accused of a crime
i haven't either really i guess other you want to count car accidents or something like that
they asked for solutions
i'll be i'll be very out forespoken here the arabs don't do everything in the world right but gosh they sure don't have too many repeat offenders over there
no i no i'm not
and the family's name too
yeah that's similar to what was this town maybe it was here in some place that on prostitution
when they caught a customer trying to solicit a prostitute either way however you wanna say it they would publish the names of the and address of the customer in the newspaper
there are a lot of divorces lot of family counseling going on but prostitution went down in that city
yeah
yeah
if you yeah if you can wanna compare crime rates by divorce and single parents and everything else i'm sure they'll be at a direct proportion to it
unfortunately
seven for dallas
if you live but we cut them off at five hundred a year and january first we had three in one day
i swear
um-hum
pull the trigger
well obviously in texas we let them out too soon
astronomical
did you see where the private ventures that built the jails and they're gonna help alleviate the overcrowding conditions are don't have any customers
who
i guess
it looks to me like you know whether you get government out of it and give it to private enterprise it's done cheaper and more economical and more efficiently put the profit motive in front of anybody and all of a sudden it works
well
maybe we ought to
put them in these air force bases that are closing and utilize those you know
i read an interesting article in texas monthly a few months back about this guy that was a guard at the ellis unit down in huntsville
and he was a regular guard a what they call a new boot or something like that and one thing led to another somebody asked for light of a cigarette or a and before long he was running dope for them and he got caught and now he's in prison himself
and the purpose of the article was just to emphasize that nobody's above it
right
um-hum
yeah i think they the corporations should do all that they should have drug screening before they hire an employee
and anytime that an employee like if they're coming to late work all the time and if they if they're especially if there's not on the line or any kind of sensitive job where
you know if they can if they made a mistake it would cost a lot of money or people's lives then they need to be watched carefully so
um-hum
right
yeah
yeah but you got to have a safe work place that's all there is to it
um-hum
um-hum
i think it's more frequent now it's probably like forty fifty percent
yeah because all the jobs that i've applied for have mentioned some type of drug screening yeah
i work at sears and i just do warehouse work
not that i know of it was more about all the people's problems like they've been laying off a lot of people and
they sent out employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem family problems you know it kind of covered everything
but i know they have a lot of drug problems so
yes i do because a lot of them are you know they're hypocritical they talk against drugs and then they get caught you know
in stings in washington whether it's drugs or any other kind of like the money laundering scams all that was drug related so
and that cost the country you know billions of dollars
so
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
i think i agree with that very much i do you
i do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves
in a position like that and say i would never do something like that and it's hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done
um-hum
i never have either
uh-huh
is there a reason why you have never
uh-huh my husband works as a policeman so i always assumed that was why i was never called uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury
somebody told me the other day that there is what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true
i never had either but i just wondered another question was should a criminal case should the jury be unanimous on their decision
and that i wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not
that would mean they all would have to decide
one way or the other
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
bring some of these things out um-hum
apparently there are i since my husband worked as a policeman i can't believe there are very many
people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of i have i still have a little bit of a problem with that
but i would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the wrong person at the right time
um-hum
um-hum
ah um-hum
um-hum
they still found him guilty
when people said he was at work
uh-huh
well
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh for heaven's sake so there's nine years of that man's life gone um-hum
no huh-uh yeah i guess that's where a lot of the problem lies we're we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial
and yeah
and we often forget about the one that the injustice has been done to
because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world
yeah it's the best one that exists i guess so
um-hum
oh i think a lot of people are i think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well i think pride in our country and our flag is so important it's important in so many facets of our life
and i feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else
there's nobody holding them here
right they'd soon be back i'm sure
yeah
um-hum
yeah i don't know about the judge making the decision if that's do you think that's good you know like if a jury
uh-huh
make a recommendation do they sometimes make a recommendation that's what i was thinking they sometimes do
um-hum
and they recommend some yeah and then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen
yeah
um-hum
well i think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time but actually their chance course when a lot of times when they come up for a parole they're denied it depends on you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and
and a lot of different things i guess
um-hum a lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do and there are bad ones that do slip back out and
end up hurting somebody again
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum i always thought there was it was wrong it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family
got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody it seemed like there sometimes there's not a good the balance isn't right it doesn't make sense
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
so
yeah right so let's put up with it i guess improve it if we can if we ever get a chance so
so
well it's been nice talking to you jack and i hope you have a real good day and week
okay laurel
so i'd like to know
what do you do in lawn and garden what what's of interest to you and how do you go about it
oh you do you do actually grow a garden to produce food
uh-huh so how much room do you have
um-hum
oh that's what i was curious about i was wondering whether you had actually some of the flowers that you had planted were bulb type that you would dig up
and then put down your garden and then put them back in later or something like that so you
uh-huh you do have a separate area
oh
uh-huh well tell me this laurel do you do you enjoy doing that kind of work and do you have the time to relax so that you can take advantage of it
uh-huh well i'm a little more fortunate i think from that point of view i'm not allergic to things and i moved here in state college
quite a while ago and was fortunate to get some land so
and my kids were there and so we set up a shop there and i would
collect the corn very carefully ear by ear and it was never more than one to two hours old and people came from miles and miles around to get that corn because they knew it was individually picked
and very fresh
twenty five by thirty or forty something like that i put in my normal food garden things each year
and i have a little bit of everything or a lot whole lot of everything in the actually
i love broccoli brussels sprouts and i have all kinds of tomatoes kale and
all those good things and i rent out my field that i used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer
and then he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use so i get out of that amount of work at any rate
it is it is very nice i really enjoy my problem is not having enough time to do the job as completely and as thoroughly as i would like i enjoy it very much
but that worked out very nicely too i built him a barn back there where in the part of my corn field and he lived in that
but as far as gardening is concerned we do enjoy it my wife is in charge of the flowers
she does all of the flower gardening throughout the whole property and we have
you know an acre an acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of and she has flower gardens and bulbs perennials and things
we have blueberries blackberries i have two or three apple trees the golden delicious were fantastic this year
my neighbor has pear trees and
oh blueberries all kinds of food around there if we just had time to take advantage of it
my wife has spent probably
i don't know how many hours in the last two or three weeks canning pears because there were so many of them and i have been totally
engulfed with golden delicious apples i just couldn't handle the -mount of them that we got this year it's really been a remarkable year
i use my golden delicious and they make delicious pies
i guess when i think of camping i think of going out and setting up a tent and
and cooking out and that kind of thing what do you think of it as
yeah
we even had it fixed up where we could setup a tent and have a have supper ready in about thirty minutes
so it worked out real well for us then have you ever done that
oh
oh
all right
yeah
um-hum
right
now where did what kind of country did you go camping in
oh yeah now that's so peaceful
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well i think it depends on probably as a child you didn't feel that you left your friends at home and you didn't like there's much to do
yeah
what kind of places did your parents go to when they camped in the trailers
just various parks and things
hm
um-hum
um-hum
oh my
no
hm
well let's see wildwood in new jersey did you go there
aha
i thought you might i understand that's a very popular place if you live in that area
yeah lots of my husband was raised in pennsylvania
and some of his friends had always talked about and what got me they never went anywhere on vacation but to wildwood
i'm you know i'm they'd go to the go to the shore go to the shore and we said you know really there are other places in the world
but
hum-um but they we have these friends he went to high school with that they go to the same place every year and have for the last twenty years
well
i you know i guess it's fine if they like it but i like to move around a little bit
um-hum
that's true and they each have their own special beauty
have you ever been up to lake texoma here in texas
that's pretty
they have a park up there eisenhower park have you been there
now that's where one place our children used to like to go
now they like to go out and fish and things like that and course they go and do their own thing since they're grown but
they
they still talk about our camping trips so maybe they didn't dislike them so much
well if you get invited huh
that sounds good
yeah you stay pretty busy here then
what's about your ideal time when you go camping how long do you like to go
no how many how many how many a week a two weeks a few days or
um-hum
cars
yeah but they there is a lot of different pollution you can get from cars right
um-hum there is carbon monoxide carbon dioxide
nitric oxide
the all that kind of stuff
yeah and there's ozone
it's like from
also like when you fill-up your car with gas
oh yeah that's right yeah
yeah um-hum yeah
hum
oh
huh
well let's see what else there's
more sometimes they say it more pollution inside your house
well i got the dry cleaning
that stuff is pretty nasty
i know all the kind of fumes you can get from bathroom cleaners your aerosols
oh yeah
what is it
scrub free huh
well
oh really where are you originally from
oh huh
well not always depends if you don't there if there's a brief stop then you get the smog
doesn't move like you're out in lake tahoe its like that you can really smell the gas fumes from cars the air is trap and it doesn't go anywhere
in fact the worst place is probably in mexico city i heard is
well they validated i think
one or two hundred day days out of a year over three or four times the
known you know the allowable limit
it crazy and some of the worst kind that our you can have also air pollution you can just have cigarette smoke
in a laundry mate
oh gosh
um-hum
really wow
hum
oh
i know which is worst cigar smoke or regular cigarette smoke
yeah hum
i don't know its a lot of smoke out her you can see
the new jersey when you go by the refinery or even when you go across the delaware river
down by
it passes away but down as you go down toward ninety five you see all that
go ahead
okay
i guess i don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be but i think just the instability of the country right now uh-huh
so scary
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
huh
uh-huh
yeah i guess that's what concerns me the most is they're so unstable that somebody like that could make decisions that would
jeopardize a lot of people
uh-huh
yeah it looks like it's come close to that as it is
uh-huh
yeah
huh
uh-huh
no i haven't
uh-huh
you mean in the in the most recent conflict
in the past ten to fifteen years
yeah i think we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too it's bad enough that the soviets do it
uh-huh
yeah it's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons
especially when it's to the south of us
uh-huh
yeah
well i think russia is getting to the point where they're about to do something to get out of communism i guess i'd would like to see somebody like yeltsin
to get more power i think gorbachev has about had his day
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh true
i don't know i sure wouldn't turn my back on them
uh-huh
at least they're learning a little bit from history i mean
right
right
exactly
well i do too and i work for texas instruments and they have a mandatory drug testing before you hire in and
i enjoy that environment i want to be in a you know drug free environment and i think that's a great way of promoting it
is to have the drug testing
right
would you see ti just started that policy they have a random drug testing policy
and
it's random in the fact that you don't know when you're going to be called but everybody will be called
and
you mean like how often would you be called up
you may be called up twenty times and one person will only be called up once but
over the whole process i this'll be an ongoing process from now on but in a year's time you might be called up i don't know twice or three times and nobody called up any
but the way they have it set up or the way i understand is that they want everyone
they've got it set up where all current employees will be called on a random basis but you know it's very likely that some may be called more than others
no just because of the random process of it and i don't know they talked about the statistics of it and how they've tried to figure out
you know to eliminate those problems but anytime it's a purely random sample you will have people called more than others
but
i'm all for it because you know i want a drug free environment i don't want a even though i do work in the office i'm a financial analyst
i'm probably in no danger as far as any chemicals or anything or machinery
have the urge and have that habit they can do that on their own time but i feel like when we're at work you know it's a team atmosphere and i think that would distract from the team
well that's true and to me they're still under the influence if it's in their body and
i don't know that's i have a strong feeling that i'm against drugs and so if anyone is using drugs and it's in their system when they're tested then
then they send you to a drug rehab which ti pays for and
huh
what's that
right
and so they send you to that and then they monitor you i believe
on a weekly basis you have to go in and take a test for and this goes on for several months
and if they if you can prove to them that you've i don't know cleaned your act up or whatever then they won't terminate you but
any time during that time if they do if you do test positive then it's automatic termination
so
are you serious
right
oh man that's right and you know the same could be true at ti if somebody's putting a missile together and they you know mess it up and then that puts
i think
any more that drugs are so prevalent you know in our society that
it may be up to the work place to help try to control it because it doesn't seem like any where else you know we're getting that assistance
because in schools you know i would hate to have a young child right now because i think this is going to be a tough period for young kids with you know the drugs as rampant as they are
i see
right
exactly or an older peer will come up to him and try to try to get him hooked on it so that he'll start selling it or something you know and i know you know just growing up
i really looked up to the older guys you know especially if they played football or basketball or whatever and i know that you know it'd be real easy to be influenced by someone like that
right
golly now is this cocaine type
oh it is huh
right
right
golly that is terrible
but i mean that makes sense because that's where all the kids are you know you have the easy access to them and you know that'd make you know that would be a logical
i tell you what these drug dealers are about the best business people there are because they know who the market is and they know exactly how to get to the market if other businesses could
do half as good as they do then there'd be some very profitable businesses
but unfortunately they prey on prey on the young kids
but i don't know
the drug testing
i do i know where my father works he works for a government contractor also and
i believe any time you have a d o department of defense contract you have to have the drug testing and you know like
athletes are starting to test them for drugs so i believe that it should be you know widespread and
that everyone should be tested what do you think
right
right
right what about teaching your profession
do you think they should in that profession
right i guess the only the only concern i'd have
right exactly
somewhere else right
you know i guess the only fear i would have would be that you know if i had a child that one in a million first grade teachers that would be on drugs my child would be in their class you know and
that's right and teachers are very influential too
what's your favorite television show barbara
uh-huh
oh my favorite television show is northern exposure
oh it's great it's such a funny show
but
i didn't watch it for the first season then a friend of mine had commented how good it was and i started watching it it's just a hoot
but other than that i like jeopardy
you know the old jeopardy game show
uh-huh
yeah boy that's a that's a hugely popular show
yeah well jeopardy comes on right after wheel of fortune monday through friday here in miami
so that's interesting to me
you know and i would have guessed brazil it turned out it was south africa
yeah which i would have never i don't know for some reason that never would have popped in my mind now what good that knowledge is i don't know but it was a interesting piece of trivia
again i there have been you know a couple of times when i thought you know golly i could have you know i could have won tonight and then again there are other times when i watch and
you know i know that i wouldn't have done so well but yeah i guess anybody that watches those you know probably thinks occasionally about it the interesting thing about jeopardy is that they never do
give any information on how to compete they do say that if you're going to be in the los angeles area and want free tickets they tell you how to get that but they don't ever say anything about
you know how to how to get to be a competitor
well they might they might that could be it and then again it could just be that they want people to take the initiative to write in you know expressing an interest i don't know
you didn't like that
yeah
yeah i saw that
yeah well anyway i kind of get a kick out of that one just because i like the husband on there he's always trying to put more power into all the electrical appliances
but then after that roseanne comes on which i have friends who just abhor roseanne but i think it's a funny show
yeah it's cute it's a cute show it really is
you mean like the little kids well i
i think we need something in place to solve the problems i certainly feel that it ought to be done
in public safety situations you know airline pilots and flight controllers and people who run trains and buses and taxi cabs
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
and i've seen a lot of kids come into foster care as a result of their parents being on drugs
and there's probably a lot out there that could probably stand public assistance or being rescued which aren't identified and so
testing at the work place in general i think is probably a good idea to save some of the kids
yes
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
well our company testing when you're hired is a requirement
and i think they have a policy of random testing but i don't know whether they've ever done it or not i kind of wish they would
and we do have an employee assistance program that's good for drug abuse treatments and other psychological problems
what
you know a lot of times i see problems here at work though i remember a few years back i had a schematic drawing that needed to be done and i was in a hurry to get it out
well i sent these drawing the rough draft over to drafting and i usually do a pretty decent drawing myself
when the drawing came back it was apparent that it had been done by two people because the line work
i'm we only get the paper on the weekends and so i'm not much of a
of a paper reader or
but i and i'm don't rarely listen to the radio so it i get most of my news like from documentaries like forty eight hours twenty you know the news at night
news in the afternoon and that kind of thing
uh-huh
right
huh
are you in the car quite a bit or
oh
oh
uh-huh oh i see
yeah i pretty much am and i watch the news at least twice a day
so if i've missed something and i've just recently decided to home with my children and so it seems as if i catch the news rise right as it happens you know there was
the explosions and that kind of thing my husband will say how'd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and that's so that that's different for me so i usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing
no it just seems like since i've recently stayed home
that is what's happened you know it's just that
i now that i've stayed home i'm usually aware of when these things have occurred and it happened and
right
uh-huh
um-hum
hum
right it kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story that kind of thing
so
yeah
uh-huh yeah i know what you're saying
you know i try and tape them if i'm out or that kind of thing i try and tape them and
so i can sit back and watch it and it's pretty interesting
um-hum
well yeah plus i find i have to video tape quite a bit of things if i don't want any interruptions yeah that kind of thing
unfortunately but that's what it seems like ten o'clock at night
uh-huh
what's your favorite show
um-hum
and the i like the cosbys too
what else do i watch i watch fresh prince
don't like that new one the royal family
i like that one with redd foxx but then i don't know what they're going to do now
because he's gone so what they're going to do about that one
what is that with urkel on it my son likes that one
yeah i like that one i guess because they're funny
you know i don't get too serious at night
if i do i'm i prefer to watch a movie than a series
i don't know too many sitcoms and
oh i guess i like tv but just nice light comedy i guess that's what you call it
nothing too serious nothing too bad so
hum-um i don't like a lot of violence
so the only time i like violence is in an action packed movie
you know but other than that hum-um
now oh and i like the trials of rosie o'near
trials of rosie o'neil
with oh goodness she played in cagney and lacey that woman
she's a cop or detective or something
but that's probably the only one i do like
i used to watch la law and then they went crazy
and then i used to watch knots landing but they got ridiculous
i don't know i guess since they took all the bad people off there's really nobody bad on the show
yes we got to have a villain
without effecting dallas
i don't know
yeah and then it gets like really sick
a lot of those stories i used to watch them but i got tired of them because all they do is sleep with everybody's husband that's all the thing is about
and i don't like that i don't like that idea
oh yeah but yeah and i used to watch that when i worked day when i worked nights
and then i when i works started working days i started watching like dynasty
can only watch so many of them
so
there's only so much plot they can give i guess
um-hum
now my son he likes the disney channel
yeah because it's you know it's got all nice movies on it anyway or little programs which is good
yeah see that's another thing most of the tv programs now that's all it is
is cop movies or something law and i get enough of that watching tv regular news
i don't need to sit down and be depressed more
so i don't know
it's okay
different shows what else you like
lucy
yeah
i like lucy
now lucy was good
did you ever watch lucy
now that one i liked lucy
she's hilarious
okay so what do you think about it
privacy right
well there is always the possibility even remote as it is of mistaken of
yeah and see that bothers me i'm a i mean i'm very much for drug testing
i really am i mean i'm going i'm going to take the negative side just for a second just to do it
see i have to take medication for a for kidney transplant and i'm going to be taking that the rest of my life now you i don't know how that's going to affect
right i mean i haven't had one yet ti i work for texas instruments and we you know we do have the random drug testing but i've missed it so far but i mean it in the back of my mind it always bothers me and what happens if it you know if it
if they catch it they think that i'm you know i'm on drugs and they send me and have me you know go through this thing you know yeah
right
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum no
yeah
right
um-hum
right well i you know i'm like i said i'm very much pro testing and this is why
it's horrible i mean
you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not
and it takes some drastic steps at this point and i think personally the drastic step has to be
that you can't work if you continue taking drugs i mean it's as simple as that i mean make it so
well make it not necessarily difficult but make it so that it's not glamorous
i mean it's glamorous taking drugs or at least it seems that way
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hum
right
right
um-hum
well then let's answer the second half of the question what limits ought to be put on it do you think
um-hum
um-hum
treatment before for dismissal type thing
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
personally i think that's what i was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested
that it could happen um-hum
right
well there's yeah there there's going to be some measure of incentive
reward or whatever but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want
so i i've got to agree with that
so hum
yeah i think so i think we i think we did pretty good
all right
it was it was talk nice talking to you too
all right bye-bye
well do you have any pets
oh right at this moment
now what kind of dog do you have
oh
i think i can picture that those are the little long haired
fluffy kind of dogs
yeah
they have hair down in their eyes sort of
yeah
for some reason
she's a stray and or was one and she's i think a mixture between a fox terrier and something else she's about eight pounds she's real little
yeah
and i'm living with my brother and
and that's been interesting
yeah
it is they've there's
learning how to play finely and my dog's establishing her territory because she was there first you know
but he's so big even as a puppy that he gets pretty rough when playing and then she lets him know
that's not good no
yeah
um-hum
oh huh
that's cute
well that's neat
uh-huh
that's good yeah
well that's neat that you do that
huh
oh definitely and it's better for them too emotionally
yeah
yeah but i don't take her out she's kind of ornery
but i like to hear the you know noises she makes i have a parakeet
yeah
she doesn't talk
she doesn't
she doesn't know how to use words but i really like the sounds she makes the chirping and all that she sings and all that stuff
no i don't think she's heard a mocking bird
oh
oh well i don't i don't even know if she's heard one i know i put her outside when the days are nice
but i don't think we've i've heard of a mocking bird around my house
or i leave the radio on for her sometimes when i'm i go to school all day so sometimes i just leave it on so she can have some kind of stimulation
um-hum
yeah
yeah i don't know if and the dogs are real sensitive with their ears
and yeah that
that would make sense that it might be comforting but
i don't know
yeah
the quiet
yeah
oh yeah
that's true that my dog too she has to be near the window and look out
so she can know what's going on
so you learn quick
yeah
kitty
yes because she acts like a cat
yeah well she's a real lap dog she likes to curl up in your lap
and she'll
she just you know
when she's real dainty
and she likes to jump
the brakes
what did you have to have done to the with the brakes
jeez
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
yeah that's their way of capturing your
pocketbook i guess for those who are least suspecting
in a lot of regards i mean
actually
you probably had a better deal that way
um-hum
gee
well i generally try to find my own personal car mechanics
rather than taking it to a shop i'm kind of like you it's
i kind of equate them with some bad dentists
who try to find problems in your teeth which i have had that experience
and that's all the major problems i've had for a vehicle that's got eighty nine thousand miles
it's a nissan
yeah
yeah it's been very good to me i
i'm going to
i would
eventually like to get into an american car but
right now this one's doing fine for me
but then the other problem too is just a fuel filter and the fuel pump and i've had to replace a set of tires a couple times
but that was due to quirks
if you ever have a flat tire
don't ever have it plugged have a patch put on it
because those plugs wear eventually will wear out all four of your tires
yeah because it causes an unevenness in the rubber
and that happened to me twice before i caught on well enough to what happened
i had one tire plugged after a flat
and somehow the unevenness of the plug just caused all the other three tires to wear out
so always have a patch put on
it's
it's happened to me twice and
that's enough
yeah you're saving about ten bucks by doing it yourself but
what the heck if you can afford it
i'd rather change it myself but
i don't have the facilities well enough all the time
so that's the only major problems you've had then
yeah
what kind of vehicle
chevette yeah
gee whiz
um-hum
um-hum
yeah the only thing you can do is
somehow through your own network and the friends find a mechanic through them
that they trust and
and then i'm sure that mechanic's not going to do you in
through their recommendation
now what was it
the belts um-hum
um-hum
yeah i know this guy that's a car mechanic and he told me i told him my belts are slipping a little bit and he said they'll last forever all you got to do is just tighten them
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hum
um-hum
i just remember a seventy nine chevy nova that i once had never again
that was a definite lemon
i got rid of that one after it cost me megabucks
that's not bad
do you have any personal feelings on the subject
um-hum
so outrageous i know i know
right
well i guess my concern is what we're reading especially in texas right now with them letting out
the people out of jail as soon as they're out of prison when they do and then having them go right back and the day they get out they're back in crime and especially when they're assaulting people and then killing people i mean the man that killed those three sheriffs
deputies he is out free walking the street i have a real problem with that
i think so
right
right
well
right
right and meanwhile the witnesses move and die and they and there's no one to face them
right well they can't get any if the judge is going to have any award to the victim it just puts off their collecting it
it's really bad it i
um-hum
a time limit too don't let it drag on for fifteen years
right
right
do you feel like there's any certain type of crime that this should be the result this should be consequences of is capital punishment or are there some murders that committed that you think leniency should be shown
um-hum
okay
right
um-hum
hm and how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are because they have had them they have had them killed when they've
oh
that was their goal oh
that would be premeditated
they killed him
um-hum
uh-huh
no well that's right there's no reason for murder i don't care if you're poor or if you're rich or if you're ugly or if you're or what there that that's just beyond the
i think this giving excuses is pretty prevalent i work in the school district and the all these kids they've got an excuse for everything and i can see it continuing on when they're adults
i just
it's i sometimes think if i were on a jury and had to make the decision could i and i like to think i could if like you if especially violent
crime where it's a serial type killer or where maybe a child has been deliberately killed or
right
uh-huh
okay when is the last time i saw a movie
well i don't know it hasn't really been that long but my the last movie i saw was on tv and i was trying to it was called back stab
and it was
it was really intriguing and i found i have a i have a problem with i just about forget them once i've seen them
but i guess the really the one that i really saw that i really liked was ghost did you see that
ghost
with
demi moore and
and the guy who did the
the dancing the dirty i'll think of it in a minute yeah he it was really good i just thought that was great
um-hum it almost makes you kind of think about things it gives you a different way of thinking them because you you're in you know that you always wonder and when you see something like that kind of well hey well maybe it could be that way
huh
i know
how about how about i guess we could talk about tv movies i mean i don't know that they're really truly movies i
they had it
yeah and they had a new episode this past what is it tuesday night maybe
ellen yeah she got married
she got married i don't know did you ever know gary
that one
right well he got killed awhile back yeah and his an image of him was at the wedding
and he was talking to his friend michael telling
well it looked like him but it would have to been his spirit or something and
oh i'm telling you i just cried and cried and cried and cried it was so it was sweet but it was sad because you know you just really miss gary
so
um-hum
oh right elliot and nancy
right but they're back together
oh yeah oh boy you've really missed a
yeah right
you watch the reruns boy i mean you could watch those for a long time if you haven't if you don't even know what's going on at all
oh you are
well that doesn't leave too much time for a movie
hm
was this done not by ti people was it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hm
that sounds interesting
it's at random right no when i place the call they just you don't have a well you had marked on your on your sheet what you had interest in or no interest in or so
okay well
you too bye-bye
are you in the part of town where they have gotten into the
other containers yet for recycling
well maybe they don't i know that was supposed to be in may and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were
yeah the
i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage
so that i don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where
it'll be interesting to see how well that works and i am i'm glad the community is doing it it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people
i don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i
growing up in rural south dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery
would candle them and package them
is that in the fifties
you could say we had
the recycling going on then that we should have now
which was all the milk bottles were glass and you got
a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them pop bottles all had a deposit on them
oh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
so you know i look back at
at my
throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well i'll have to say i'm the only one i'm good at this point is the newspaper
taking that to the boy scouts and my aluminum cans
getting rid of those but on the plastic i have
i don't have any habits there yet and i'm guess i'm waiting for the city to push me in that direction but
but it just seems like on the larger scale that
you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things and i think if
if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like was the case years ago that it would have more immediate effect
than because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window and so
outside my little town
we would go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something
yeah
i well that's interesting because they're back to glass you're saying
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
the carton the paper carton
yeah
well i mean the you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood
racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold twenty four bottles and
and
i'm not really say going back to good old days but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now
well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the grass i'm i know your husband
doesn't really like the paper sacks
yeah i'm the i'm the same way because otherwise
oh i'm i generally listen to neal sperry on saturdays and neal
neal's a person who says i like to pick it up but i don't believe in throwing it into the
the landfill so i have my compost pile but most of us don't have the sufficient lot size to
to do that
so i'm glad the city's willing to take that on
well there's someplace you know if it's because really when i look at what my grass does in actually about twenty four hours
knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally composts or stores and
so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but it's
it's certainly usable material
uh-huh
right
but i the thing i don't understand about that is like when it's one thing to send grass there but i've trimmed trees and other things which
end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly but it's still natural and i just don't know
uh-huh
yeah i do have a car
right now i have sort of a sporty car it's a subaru that it's called an xt6 i don't think they make them anymore i think i have the last year
and it's one of these japanese cars that run without needing many repairs
my advice about cars is get a good engine get something that goes not because i'm a speed freak something because if you want to get on a highway you don't want to step on the gas and say come on come on
and i have a six cylinder and it does go when i tell it to and i just like the looks of a kind of sporty car
i think my car needs are going to change i had very small children and i was saddled with a station wagon that i never wanted
i was told that you know it'll hold groceries and all this stuff well the grocery bags fell over in a station wagon
you know and you know and i wasn't that thrilled to put a bike in it or a dog in it and i didn't so when i got a new car i got a sporty little car and my kids were still small enough but they weren't in baby seats anymore and they sat in the back
and now my son is fourteen and a half and he's taller than i am and every time i go over a bump he crashes his head because
you know these cars have they're backseats but they're kind of toy backseats
and you know practical again so this i guess this is my reprieve and i guess my suggestion to you is to get something you really enjoy because at some later date you'll have to get something more practical
uh-huh
well you know the more i think of it you know with what's going on in the world nowadays i think the next car i would try to buy an american one
yeah i think so it's you know toyotas and all those they're nice cars but you know surely there's an american car i i'd love to check out the saturn which is supposed to be a new newly made american car
oh yeah i have
is it really
huh
really how was the pricing
oh that's not horrible at all that's quite good nowadays
yeah
parts are made in different places right i wonder who makes the geos
is it because they're so cute the geo storm is adorable
no i don't in fact i sat in one a long time ago and slammed the car door and it felt a little tinny you know it it's a smaller lighter car
but you know that was years ago that was about four years ago when i bought mine so it may have changed i know on looks i think the storm is just adorable little car for a single person
hm are you working yet
uh-huh
yeah because i was wondering if you're are you going to finance it
right
well i have been fortunate enough to be able to just pay for it and i like to do that but there are people who can pay for it who prefer to finance it
yeah it seems to me as you're paying interest you're bound to be end up paying more i guess now you have to think about if the money in the bank will get more interest
then you'll want to finance it but if now the banks are giving so little interest i imagine you might as well just pay for it if you could
do they really
oh my they probably just take it for granted then
and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall today we just had
oh i see okay well we're leaving tomorrow and we're going down to new orleans and from ohio since we're right near lake erie this is gonna be a switch for us for a week
going down there and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity but as far as the gardening and things like that goes i don't know
too much too much about how much i really do enjoy it myself do you like it at all
well how about when you were in colorado
uh-huh
well and then too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly my water bill was
it's so okay very good i guess we've kind of covered our subject matter since neither one's really into gardening are we
what is the last home repair that you did
um-hum
oh
um-hum
yeah
well repaired the back fence it's well of course they get old you know after about ten years anyway but
yeah the alley's on a kind of a slant
and it makes all the fences tilt or slowly you know
yeah somewhat right
um-hum
had to replace the ridge row the shingles on the corners of the roof from all the storms and everything
and
right yeah
um-hum
weather proofing and
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
what's
um-hum
right
and it soaks in to those bricks really well and it seals all the water out
just a little bit
yeah they use it all the time
yeah it seals the water out
right
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
right
yeah i'm from dallas
but
uh-huh
right
um-hum
yeah and it's set into the earth so
um-hum
right uh-huh
yeah
we me and my wife we got a five year old and we have
kind of like child rearing he we have problems with him every now and then but other than that it's pretty he's a pretty good kid
and we really don't really have any problem with finding day care for him because i'm in the service and we just take him to the day care on base
they charge about forty five dollars a week
yeah it's pretty expensive on the outside
oh yeah they do a lot of you know lot of stuff in their day care and stuff
oh about a year now
well before that my wife was kind of stay at home mom now she went back to school so
no the wife went back to school
so he's been there for almost a year now
she goes to ut arlington
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah well when i was stationed in lubbock texas they had a child care center right on base right at the school i mean
and that helped out my wife because she just went part time there and you know take a couple of classes a week but
and i think it's a good deal but like you were saying it's about two miles from the school and that's
it's not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting one right on the campus itself
well they kind of have this i think in a different building you know on right on the
edge of the campus and everything where they really didn't get in
oh yeah i think they used one of the existing buildings they already had
so you know it worked out pretty good
well i haven't really thought about it like that
excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we don't pay as much as they do off base
i think the government should subsidize some of it you know
to give the parents you know some break on the money portion of it
you know one thing that i miss being in a small company is the opportunity for
job growth just different job opportunity i was talking with somebody from bausch and lomb today and she was telling me how she started as a clerk typist and then found another opening in another department and
moved on and so forth and so forth and is now personnel director
and i mean it's just it's there's so much opportunity in a larger company to stay within the same company so you're not losing your seniority level but
just to try new things and see new areas and departments and i mean you can in a large company you can go from one department to another department as if you switched companies sometimes
um-hum
uh-huh
well uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh well it's true yeah
there is a very at least in my office and i know that's not necessarily the way it is all over but the camaraderie within the office
when you're with a small company i think you're right you could be even you can be a big person in a small company you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh sure
right
uh-huh
i yeah i understand that you know a question that i have for you is do you feel working in a large company do you feel that you can see the impact that you make
do you feel that you can see like the results i know in my company each person is vital because we are the company and each person really can see the results that they produce
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh i do feel bad for the people i mean obviously we all work for a paycheck but it's nice if you can be enjoying it you know while you're doing it
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that is great
oh really
uh-huh
that is wonderful
uh-huh
uh-huh well
yeah
uh-huh
that is great and that is so smart because with everything becoming so much more technical and sophisticated
you're just not finding people out in the work force that have the skills that you necessarily need
i you just don't find them and it's such a great way take the people that you already have and train them
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh exactly
oh my
oh exactly i mean it's incredible
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
wow
yeah
uh-huh
right
right
oh that's great
that is fabulous
you know another benefit that i wish i had more of and who wouldn't is vacation time
you know
i think that when you're working and an especially i don't know i mean every job you say how you're constantly putting out fires
you know i feel like my job is like that too unfortunately but that just it drains you know after a while it
yeah exactly right
uh-huh
oh
oh wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
right uh-huh
uh-huh
it's hard
is that what your company policy is too
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my goodness
but that is a long time and especially when you take a weeks vacation
i was just talking to somebody about this today it's funny it takes you until tuesday or wednesday to really wind down
you know to say okay i can relax i can sit here for an hour if i want to and just not do anything and realize that you don't have to be worrying about something you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
that's true
uh-huh
they could hire temporaries to fill in
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
like a co-op type thing for the summer
like a co-op for the summer
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
yeah that is and it also gives you a chance you know to look at these kids and make your own determinations
i'm twenty five
well what do you think are some of the main causes of air pollution
yeah i think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders but then there's like you say there's industry
with all the sulfur and all that other stuff they're dumping out into the atmosphere
causing acid rain and everything else
hm
ozone yeah ozone pollution yeah
well i was i was thinking about that too i mean we don't have any suitable replacement for freon and you have to have it for refrigeration so
but on the other hand you know i i've
i took a boat cruise one time and it had a refrigerator on board and it was powered by propane
it was actually powered by a flame
yeah it something with heat i don't understand the mechanics of it but
um-hum
um-hum
oh okay so it still had freon in it
oh okay i well
yeah
yeah
right which happens all the time when they go to service the things
um-hum
yeah escape
sure yeah i
hm well that makes sense
i i'm more worried about the ozone than i am anything else i think we're getting a handle on sulfur dioxides and
all that kind of stuff cooperating with the canadians on the acid rain problem
we can't clean it up
um-hum
um-hum
burning and everything else
yeah
yeah that's right when i was a kid i used to do the same thing it's
i don't i don't know what the rain forests have to do with it but you know they're chopping those down at a tremendous rate everyday
and i just have a feeling that you know that's our that's our air scrubbing stuff there and they're taking away the sponge
i don't know this
ozone
yes
naw i can believe it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
gosh
well it's
yeah right the
the action over the rocks and all that kind of stuff
jeez well that's scary
i it worries me to turn on the turn on the taps now because you never know what's gonna come out
yeah well it's like so many it's like chicken you know they go in there and they supposedly inspect this chicken
i don't know if you ever saw that 60 minutes thing where they showed a chicken processing plant
yeah i haven't touched chicken since
yeah i couldn't i couldn't bear to think about eating a chicken after seeing that
and but the government says it's safe uh-huh
right that's about what they say about the air pollution in this country
and they -eah it's getting better it's getting better and then you turn around and you look and places like los angeles is still so thick you have to cut it with a knife
i don't know
just about yeah
yeah i don't know you know used to be a lot of states had
you had to have your car checked for pollution every year you had to have that little sticker in the window i know texas does
and there are about three places in georgia that does
and i think louisiana does i'm not sure but i there's not very many of them around anymore
yeah they don't do it anymore
yeah
um-hum
i think that's the problem with most of it the politicians finally did away with it because the people were so mad about having to pay that fee
yeah and i mean all it was a revenue generator
it wasn't serving the purpose that it was designed to serve
i mean you look at the cars driving down the road and you look at these things belching huge blue clouds of oil smoke
and you tell me that guy passed a pollution test you know
oh yeah oh those are
yeah i you know what was it back in the late seventies when diesel engines were the thing
because it was so much cheaper than gas now you look diesel's
what one forty one fifty a gallon while gas is you know one oh five
i never did like diesels anyway they were too cantankerous
cold
yeah i had a friend of mine had a had a buick had a diesel in it and he had nothing but trouble with the thing
yeah winter time the diesel would gel and it wouldn't
i don't know liquefy right and then his injector things got clogged and oh
um-hum
yeah
that may that yeah that may have been what he had
yeah
i'm just wondering about the feasibility of electric cars
i saw an article in the
it's near it's near san diego it's called national city
yeah it's just a little rinky-dink town but
most people don't go there it's really not a good neighborhood
yeah it's nicer down there
unfortunately i need to be near the naval base so
right
okay i'll push the button hang on
alrighty there we go
so do you go camping at all
yeah my husband and i like going for the long weekends we usually like going up to one of the camping grounds that have a lake near it
yeah i like hiking unfortunately around here there's not too many spots to do stuff like that
yeah i'm from arizona and they've got a lot of it there too
they've also got desert i don't know what you call it but
sites in the desert they have a special name for it
huh
oh really do you know where mayer's at
mayer outside prescott
yeah
oh there's a lot of beautiful camping places around sedonia and they're getting they're getting more of them
but i like the rustic kind of camping
yeah
uh-huh
oh that'd be neat
right
that sounds like it'd be nice
yeah unfortunately my husband and i haven't been able to go camping because i just had two kids two boys and
huh
well no i spaced them out about a year a part
but until they get a little bit older we really don't want to take them out camping with us
but yeah we haven't got to go lately but when we go we we're from arizona so when we go back on vacation next year we'll get to go
which should be nice
it is actually
i'm from dallas yeah
okay
um-hum
um-hum
they started with newspapers and of course aluminum cans and bottles and plastic
i didn't know there were different types of plastic though
um-hum
oh
oh
yeah it seems to be made out of something different
um-hum
yeah
hum
that's right yeah
um-hum
lunch bags and
yeah they didn't
yeah um-hum
no
um-hum
oh
yeah
um-hum
hum
yeah they'll run out of space before long
um-hum
um-hum
right
right yeah
they don't even know that paper comes from trees yet so
how do you grow paper
um-hum
and how do you grow aluminum
right
um-hum
yeah
well i was thinking
how the government has changed over in europe and russia
you know
all those countries becoming democratic for one thing
um-hum
i'm twenty seven
um-hum
uh-huh
so it
uh-huh
and then i was thinking about how women's roles have changed
i'm twenty seven by the way i was born in sixty four
uh-huh
okay
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh that's true
because we might be liberated but now we all have to work and support ourselves and
but it has it's pluses and minuses i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
it's like a luxury now
uh-huh
yeah it's hard work but it's like you have to have a husband that makes very good money in order to do that i guess
uh-huh that's true
well of course there's aids and i don't have to guess why you know because just her generation will just like jump in bed with anybody you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh it's scary
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i guess like in the sixties and the seventies i was
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
the other way
uh-huh i think you're right
uh-huh
unless they can get a cure
unless they find a cure real soon
for aids
no i'm single
uh-huh
yes
and
uh-huh
can you think of any other social issues government
do you have any idea how long we have to talk
oh i didn't even look at the clock did you
okay
same here
nice meeting you bye-bye
yes we try to we have not in some years now and i think we are going to try to have one this summer
my aunt is planning it
missouri
southwest part of missouri
that will be where it is if she gets it planned i have been out of town so i do not know what she has been doing but
they are all getting very old all my aunts and uncles so we need to see them soon
uh-huh
right do you all get together often or
uh-huh
right
i think as we get older it is more difficult to
when all my aunts and uncles are in their eighties now so it is
i have to i will probably have to take charge and do it one of these one of these
days
but
i still have elderly parents alive so it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date you know that
and if they are
right
uh-huh
oh my gosh
yeah
so the
yeah and we need to have more and more of them i think i hope that is not a lost art that people getting together as they do spread out all over the world
yeah it is
oh i see
uh-huh
sure that makes a big crowd
yeah
is that
is that right
that is wonderful i hope
well we need to have another one i hope my aunt is successful as later well it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them i it was supposed to be this june so i don't imagine there is anything coming this is hardly almost june
so
uh-huh
yeah that's
we have it usually at this at this one park because there is a pavilion there in case it rains and
and you have to have it fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there
in missouri yeah it is too it is not just very humid and the old people cannot take it anymore
uh-huh
um-hum
isn't that great
yeah
yeah
yeah well that keeps you busy yeah
yeah it would have been something for the young people to do but
um-hum
yeah
every family has all that going on i am sure
so
oh i do too that is the best part of it
everybody bringing something for a potluck picnic and
oh grand yeah
i do not know i think it has been four three or four years or five even since they have had it tried to get everybody together they are just spread out so much and
and we really need to no matter what kind of crowd they get
i hope
um-hum
yeah well time flies so fast it may have been that long since we have one it is hard to remember but i think it has been about four or five years
so
anyway i hope both our families get to have one soon
yeah it is difficult with little ones i know when we had our
um-hum
sure
oh lord
oh i am telling you
that's
no i hope
it i know it takes a lot of effort right with that with two little ones like that
yeah
enjoyed talking to you good luck in everything
bye-bye
well we probably have about three months
approximately
um-hum we live on a it used to be a farm but we don't farm much we but we do have a garden
uh-huh
uh-huh
you right
yeah
you almost have to get started pretty early probably i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
more bad weather
um-hum
but
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
um-hum
huh
oh yeah
but it's a pleasure to like you said it's good to get outside and
we didn't have too good luck with it because the we had a couple good real good wind storms and it really damaged the corn so we didn't get too much
corn last year
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
hum
um-hum
oh that's great
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah we have an old fashioned tub sitting that you know water runs into and my husband set up a pump that runs it runs till it's down and then it stops
and then when the water comes up it comes on again and we use that to water our garden
with
so
oh i do i love it
i'd rather be doing that than housework
not a whole well not a whole lot i think our cabbages and broccolis and that we have more trouble with
that type of thing with the yeah
uh-huh do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally or do you use insecticides
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh did well did does your wife ever make a bake in a hot bacon dressing like for salad
um-hum
uh-huh this is the use the greens and you get them when they're young and tender you know before they've grown too taut because they do get a little stringy
but they're kind of fun to
to try get a get a few and throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes
yeah
i don't know
but i've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back and he's been having trouble with so wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower so it takes about four hours to cut our grass
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's great
great that's a lot of people don't have that much space even
that
uh-huh
so you have all the conveniences of a city yeah and the country also
no especially if your into any hobbies or anything or
uh-huh
roly-poly what
is it a bug you mean
a worm a cut worm not a grub worm
oh
um-hum i'm trying to think of what they are what kind they would be
you find them under bricks usually and that
they're not a slug
not a
yeah
oh really they are not hard are they are they a hard worm
oh are they black then
but they roll up i can't think of what kind they would be
uh-huh i'm no help on that then because i can't think of what they are
what they would be
i think you have a lot more insects down there even than what we have
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh i know my brother had trouble with fire ants and that even yeah and they be can be a real dickens
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
ours are going to be coming out now our cancer society sales daffodils right now they're big now so we have daffodils for in the house because of the cut flowers but they're just beginning to come out the end bud
oh
oh
oh they're such a nice bright early spring color
um-hum
um-hum and they're beautiful too yeah they're beautiful
uh-huh
oh my
yeah no we won't have too much here for another couple of months yet really yeah we're it's raining today
well our grass like i said is just grass we really didn't plant anything it's just so i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even
and
uh-huh
um-hum
it's probably very pretty
uh-huh we have some people that have done their lawns and
uh-huh
uh-huh
you don't know yeah
right that they pick up
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
right
nobody wanted to do it
it do you have a place to take them
wow is that right
worth it yeah not worth the gas huh yeah
right
yeah oh i know i know it
now what do they do i have cats too but they don't do anything with newspaper
oh really
with their claws or chew it
how fascinating
oh isn't that interesting i've got three cats but newspapers don't seem to interest them at all
is that right oh my gosh
and then they learned how huh
well that's funny well i we do have more facilities than that around here so that we they're they are trying in dallas to do some
curbside recycling they've got special you they selected sites and in those sites they they've been doing it and they've had a pretty good success so they're talking about
you know doing it more but it isn't in my area so i've got a kitchen full of you know cans and bottles and scrap metal and
everything and then i have to drive it somewhere and there
then everybody would do it well it's one of those things that makes you feel good you know makes you feel like you're part of a of a solution to a problem
and there's not that much that makes you feel like you've got any control over anything so
back to the grocery so your grocery store does that uh-huh yeah well that's good
and that's strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally recyclable they're the easiest and you know i mean i try to keep and reuse and i
and i've gotten to saving the plastic forks and washing them and using them again so i don't keep doing that but boy i mean it's an exhausting way to live
uh-huh
right exactly lots of little soya sauces and ketchups all over the place
yeah
no please no
yeah
and that's hard to get rid of unless you've got there's one place here in town that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and
cereal boxes and everything but you have to drive it downtown and so you know my kitchen i mean certainly i don't like anyone to ever come in because i've just got this stuff everywhere i don't drive it every day so i've got just piles of it
right
but you have to move out of your house to have all that yeah
yeah i know and it really is hard and i then i'll fill up the back of my car and i'm driving around with trash in my car and well at least maybe it keeps someone from stealing
okay why don't you start so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon
oh you are
oh wonderful well how do you dress for work
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
so you in a church there
uh-huh well i'm working this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool and they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds
probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just tennis shoes and play clothes
yeah
do you
well so are the people around you dressing similar to you
um-hum so you don't have a you don't have to go out and buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do
well that's good
that's good
um-hum
well my husband has to take the bus into dallas and doesn't return all day so he has to dress
and he's just really hates that they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit
and even when his job is not gonna be with people all day long he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well i think that's i think that's great i think that's good
well another interesting thing on the our end here is how even in my forties how much younger i dress than my mother would have in her forties
right and pearls and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school so she tells me i dress young but that's okay keeps me young
you know the dress men's dress shoes
but for as out here just anything that the moms we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids
yeah i'm sure they are there yeah i'm sure they are
that's right i'm sure that's true it's a lot different than working in a kid's preschool that's right well you all have a nice day there
thank you very much bye-bye
what what's the main way that you keep up with the current events
right
right
right
i
that's my main source also i usually get it when i'm going into work and read the paper real quick
so that's usually my main source because i sometimes i'm if i'm here i'm in and out and can't really watch the news all the time
right
right
exactly what do you think about the coverage
does it sort of depend on the event what's going on
oh okay yeah
how they how they
right
huh
yeah sometimes i guess they do have to jazz it up just a little bit for it to make news for people to read it yeah
but
accurate right
well you know anymore they can they can be anywhere and almost talk to anyone instantly it seems like
and man it seems like they can get about fifty different views you know of experts just in a matter of seconds
right
yeah you know with the persian gulf deal you know it's the first oh probably the first week or so we really watched cnn every night and
it was really interesting then after a while i mean it just seemed like everybody was an expert on the topic and
right
exactly
right
exactly
you know in the persian gulf i think that is a perfect example of the media being hungry for something to happen
you know it's it had been so long since there been a major event
you know i think it was because and i don't know how accurate this is but i heard that you know even schwartzkopf and some of those guys was were watching cnn to try to get some of the updates
and that just seemed outrageous you know that they'd watch these reporters to
to get updated
exactly
well yeah you know there's not enough money in the world for me to be up there in probably the highest building in baghdad while all these bombs are going off i mean
that's right
you know i sort of have a tough time feeling sorry for those guys when they get captured over there
i mean they're just almost asking for it when they when they sign up for these projects and
right
right
oh yeah and those guys over there don't give a flip i mean what they going to you know what are we going to do go to war with them we already are and yeah
so yeah it that and the people working over there if they've had plenty of warning and had opportunities to leave then
you know i i'm sure there's certain circumstances where it's you know it's impossible but man some of those people just need take a hint and get out of there
right
yeah and i think it's unfortunate that we have to risk some of our soldiers' lives to try to get them out you know after it's almost too late
right
exactly
right
exactly
yeah
that's right
that's right and you and you know i like the sensational type stories you know and the man the just like you were saying the media of all types just jumps all over it
right
exactly
right
well you know sort of like this kennedy deal going on where supposedly some nephew raped this girl well you know that's i think a lot of that's just you know the smut news coming out and
right
yeah and you know that's just and the media has jumped all over that
but well i appreciate the conversation you have a good evening
bye-bye
yes sir
well you mean that i did or had done
and a lot of the little minor wood things corrected
and just prior to that i had a bathroom totally remodeled and rebuilt and so i've i'm bringing my house up-to-date really
we built the house in nineteen sixty
no
that's right they do change and the bathrooms you know if you have any water leakage anywhere can slowly deteriorate things and so you got to plug those leaks up
um-hum
is that right is the water level high there
um-hum
oh well we just got about a an inch and a half last night
oh i see
i declare
um-hum
oh i see are you doing this yourself
i declare oh well
um-hum
uh-huh
that's true these lot of fellows really want to work pretty hard so they willing to come at little bit more reasonable prices i'm sure of that i just had some guttering also replaced on my home
i actually replaced all the other guttering last year and the piece that i did this year seemed all right at the time so i left it alone
that's what i put up this last time it's one solid piece about thirty feet long
so i it was i have seen these things done they come on great big large wheels i think of material and they roll it off
yeah
well this as i say this was already they had come out and measured it and brought out the two pieces at the correct length and all they had to do is mount them and then seal one joint where the two ends came together
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
worked all right huh
that's very close i
as they say down south you done good
yeah
well that sounds great
yeah well i've got this the we were talking earlier about my house i've got one more bathroom to rebuild and
we also have a porch that extends out from our master bedroom that we want to rebuild it's taken a beating over the years and now we're a little afraid to walk out on it because some of the wood is deteriorating
we're in between the mountains we're in what we're called nitny valley at penn state i
alright
okay so what kind of piece of property have you got
um-hum
well i
up here we don't have too much trouble with crab grass or anything like that
we've -ike we rent the house that we live in but we've got a pretty large piece of land that we live on even though very close into washington dc
and so most of the work that we have to do involves mowing the lawn and my sweetheart who i live with does a lot of flower gardening and stuff around the house she gets a lot of pleasure from that
hm well it changes from year to year and she's thinking this year she's gonna get into bulbs and that sort of thing but most of the sorts of things that she
has grown in the past have been
i guess wild flowers and some stuff that our neighbors sort of brings over periodically she's also she likes things like hollyhocks and peonies and
oh let's what else has she got oh the other things she's really into is morning glories and in the summer time we have morning glories just all over the house it's great all different colors
yeah it's a lot of fun it's real pleasant in fact our next door neighbor in christmas time this year couldn't resist giving us a set of coffee cups had morning glories all over them
and she found them and she said oh i just had to buy them for you but we're also really into vegetable gardening
actually yeah actually we do we don't have any you know varmints or anything like that
that tend to bother the garden but we do have a lot of trouble with insects particularly caterpillars we've had very poor luck with all of the core crops and like
uh-huh
well that's exactly what we've done and you're advice is dead on in our experience in fact thing that we've found works even better than lime is diatomaceous earth
yeah well
jackie got a hold of a huge box of it so much of it that i dare say that we'll probably still using be using it five years from now
she went out to some pool supply place and got this huge box of it and it's really it's big
and she came home with it and she was real proud and she said okay well we've got a lifetime supply now so we've got no excuse and
well we have i guess in the last two or three years really discovered that we're really fond of hot peppers and so
we grow tomatoes down one side of the house where we get a lot of sun and then in our regular garden plot this past couple of years we've grown a lot of different varieties of hot peppers
yes which of course are our favorites and but we've also grown a lot of real hot smaller varieties like tais and
yeah the cayennes and we've even grown some little funny peppers and i've never been sure one of them i believe is called chili tepid and the other one is called pequine and
they're little green
literally pea size peppers they're just little tiny guys and they dry up even smaller than they are when they're you know fresh food on the
the plant but the plants are just incredibly prodigious they just produce zillions of them
all kinds of dishes we like i say we grind them up and we freeze some of them and then use them in stews and whenever we make egg dishes or anything like that we tend to
to put some on it it's just incredible with the numbers of ways that we come up to use them
but anyway it it's something that we enjoy immensely and it we get a lot of pleasure out of i love tilling up the garden every year and you know getting out there and just spending some
okay so frank what type of
budget do you or your family have
right that's
i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically
i'm the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier
and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and
i kind of
i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i i'm pretty consistent from month to month
and whenever i need to you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
um-hum
um-hum
right
yeah that's
i guess i kind of do a similar thing more medium or longer range i just have a
maybe a target amount that i'll save for like i'm probably within a year i'd like to buy a new car
so i kind of have an amount in my mind and i'm making every effort to
you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever
right
um-hum
hm
right
right
have you thought about leasing
i see
right
but if you're rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that
but i'm hoping that
most of them were just kind of you know the
as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year
right
right what line of work are you in
okay
well i can see it in certain cases where it might be somebody's in a position that perhaps a lot of lives are involved like maybe pilots that
you know fly jets and maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people i could certainly see it being done but in general
you know whether companies wanna do this and i know that companies do like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested i know a couple of corporations that are doing that
so you know they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab but
there's got to be like a limitation do we drug test everybody that comes in or do we kind of say well you can be drug tested and you look okay because you look this way you're very conservative and
there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of the conservative or whatever could be drug tested
and you know whether legal rights and of that person i don't know there's certainly a lot of things to really consider when you get into drug testing people
just at the work place unless of course like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people that's about it
um-hum
sure and i think that's what companies are doing more and more because there are products that are out there
um-hum
exactly
sure
sure
exactly the only thing is
exactly
exactly the only thing is the one issue that i would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive
if they have had like medications in the past let's say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an advil
and the advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana
and there's poppy seed type things i think everybody's aware of that but where's the line where you where you say to somebody i'm gonna drug test you tomorrow so please do not take these medications or where's
you know how can you how can you do it
exactly
um-hum
sure
sure exactly and the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on let's say
you've taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you've taken
let's say you do come out positive and you've taken advil or any of the ibuprofen products out there or you've had a cold and you've been on medication or whatever you come out positive
is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well you know
this is kind of iffy you know are they really on drugs or are they on thrugs you know what i'm saying where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person
is on drugs or make up they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee you know what i'm saying
um-hum
exactly and it's a they can that if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take you know what i mean it it's kind of like
i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that
really wow
what station do you listen to
cliff i see so it's not affiliated with anything is it not a network station okay yeah because i listen to public radio a lot and they have
yeah so you have a paper or something or
um-hum
yeah
fact last time i read the dallas news i was in arkansas
oh yeah
so
how did that happen anyway
oh really
huh
quite a task if you've ever run into one they're
yeah they're thick
if there's something you want to know it's in the times and then in detail
they we used to have two papers here in town and then the herald examiner collapsed about two years ago because of
oh i don't know just nobody was buying it really
yeah pretty much there used to be in fact i think there still is the daily news which runs out of the san fernando valley
and they're not bad as far as a you know as far as a local paper goes in fact it was kind of weird because i met the i met the i met the editor
while i was on while i was doing jury service in santa monica one time it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff he was a really cool guy
you know went to columbia university and all this stuff
and it's a pretty good paper but you know it's not the it's not the times
although i you know i'm starting to see some of their there's a daily new
news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that they're expanding i guess
but and occasionally i pick up like time magazine or something i think if they've got an interesting lead story but
you know it's i don't have time
yeah that's kind of a problem for them there's a lot of people who fall into that category
uh-huh
i see
it's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover
uh-huh
yeah i know
i
yeah
oh really
yeah i find that attitude kind of arrogant though it's like you're taking our money but you're not bothering to cover things that are interesting to us
you ready okay what have you seen lately
oh i'm dying to see that
oh
uh-huh
oh my goodness
oh well i am just dying to see it i went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a babysitter and we'll all go see regarding henry and i said ooh i want to see it so bad
oh
yeah
oh my well let me see was it well we went to see one hundred and one dalmatians last weekend and that may be
no right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on we're going to the movies and we won't well she goes all the time but i go maybe once every couple of months
and when i go i go see two at a time so we went to see soapdish
and oh hysterical we laughed so hard it was just you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard
yeah that's the other one that we went to see that night
and my face hurt so bad from laughing because i love billy crystal and course growing up on the back of a horse you know and being on ranches and stuff
so much of that was so true and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles it was so funny both of them were great
oh they are we just laughed so hard and like i said with city slick i mean with soapdish it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know just they just carried it off to the tee it was
no
how neat
shoot yeah
oh yeah
yeah i think it is i think it is
yeah
oh gosh i never laughed and people were just screaming and applauding and you know it was just hysterical
oh me too because i don't even know if i could live through it now i mean i'm getting around real good and i'm just still real sore and today i was i course i went back to work two weeks after
but see i don't have permanent work i right now i'm working with a temporary agency
and so the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers because you can learn all the software for free
and so i went up to do wordperfect because that seems like that's what everybody wants
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day and i said yeah and i went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that
and i worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week and
so i went to my doctor's last thursday and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh you're just healing really well i just can't get over this he says
in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things if you want to play ball you can go play ball he says now i'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball but you can if you want to and you know he was teasing me and
he says yeah you'll be out there waterskiing i can just see it now
and he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks you've only got two more weeks i said okay fine i will i will whatever you call easy i'll do it you know
but and i've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it
and so i don't i'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when i was when i'm still sort of on the sore side
but well what's your next have you seen robin hood yet
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
well i went course i am a kevin costner fan supreme
uh-huh gosh was that wonderful
oh yeah
i do too i think he's really good
i wouldn't think well my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night so i sort of think i may go do that
i my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between ashley and jamie's age and we went to the
yeah
oh yeah that'll be nice
i haven't either really
right well i think it's gotten easier nowadays if you have something and you have to return it most places are willing to you know go with the customer
um-hum
on yeah i know i know
that's true that's true i haven't had to return anything that i can think of but you know like radios and things they've become so cheap that even if they do break it's better just to go get another one than have it fixed
you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah the stuff like that you know
yeah and i you know like television and stereos and things they're a lot cheaper if they're japanese made
you know i've gotten to the point where i think so but i've had to return i think a television one time and
the color went out but and it was like a month later and i didn't have any problem whatsoever which i think is good but
you know years ago you didn't never have to return anything everything worked for so long
oh yeah
um-hum
really
wow
clothes is about mainly what i've you know gotten lately and i think they've gone downhill
as far as unless you it's you get what you pay for
right
um-hum
um-hum
that's true
right
yeah
yeah i agree with you it's kind of hard for the small man
to make it you know with the homemade thing
you know
um-hum
right
wow that's pretty interesting
i can't that's the only thing i can think of is clothes you know and they're going up so high if you want a well made you know piece of clothing
or in matter of fact furniture also you know you have to go you have to pay a lot more it's the old adage you get what you pay for
but you know and you can get oh i know i bought a real cheap couch one time and it looked good but it was cheap and it didn't last very long you know
i think the frame of it wasn't really good because it was probably mass produced
you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum
do you have a problem with your water heater
if
um-hum
uh-huh
are you relating this to the affair we've got going on in haiti right now
right
that that's just it
right i guess my concern
you know no matter which no matter which side we take we're gonna have supporters and we're gonna have
antisupporters i guess for lack of better term
and
like you said they're such small countries
that we're bound to upset somebody but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance
right
right
that's true
sure
the honduras or guatemala or somewhere in there no she was from el salvador
and
she was from a relatively wealthy family and when the contras came into power
of course with
oh gosh darn it what's his face he's in florida jail now marcos
no he's marcos is philippines
well you know who i'm talking about
yeah i know it anyway when he came into power he basically just took everybody's property you know just assigned it to himself
right and
so she's been a real strong supporter of the sandinistas and has been trying to back the us government in that respect and i in that respect i have to agree that
i think we're taking the right stance because they were a democracy
turned
you know right basically a dictator fascist
sure
well what do you think of this us free trade agreement we're working on with mexico
um-hum
um-hum
mexico
they're i know they're trying they're really trying the mexican government is trying and a lot of the larger mexican businesses are trying to
oh
make themselves americanized i guess
and
which is great because that's what they basically need to do the big problem with the united states
is we
have our basic nine to five schedule you know and we don't have the siesta and there's the cultural differences is what
is what's kind of it's what's really hurting the mexican people because they've had their way of life and we've had our way of life and
anyway i guess there was just somebody recently down there today in texas was it or there was
put to death
in california yeah
yeah so how do you feel about it
about capital punishment
um-hum
yeah
well i've you know i kind of like you there's certain crimes that i think it fits i'm for it generally speaking i think the thing that bugs me the most about it is that
the process itself gets so drug out and so
it almost becomes more you know to much cost and more trouble than it's worth you know to put somebody like that to death or something that you know
rather than just sentence him to life and forget all the hassle you don't have to pay the attorneys all those fees they get and whatnot because i feel like you know sometimes it gets too drug out but
i think i am i am basically for it with if you know if the crime of course fits it because some of those people this you got to wonder will they ever do anything i mean
the time just comes that pure and simple you know you got to wonder if they're just a plain and simple menace to society or they gonna
ever reform but
yes we do uh-huh and i and it's been a there was a oh it's been about fourteen years now there was a pretty hideous murder
in a hi-fi shop where they murdered one person and they the two people that did it they poured drano down one guy's throat and they kicked a pen through another guy's ear and all kinds of things like that and of a couple of them ended up dying and a couple didn't but
ah one of the kid one of the two men involved was put to death oh about two years ago and like i said if it took about thirteen years for it to happen and the other guy is still sitting on death row you know fourteen fifteen years later
and that's why you know like i say a part of my thing with the whole appeal process kind of bugs me because here they have sat for you know fifteen years and i wonder about the families of the people who are the victims you know and they've got to be a little bit upset themselves and
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that's true yeah they
oh i lost my point but yeah that's like i say i think the victims and just if that's gonna happen they just wanna have it done and over with but you know i agree there's got to be some appeal process because
it's almost you wanna make sure in that situation that the person really did commit the crime you wanna give him every opportunity you possible can but
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's the scary part especially something like this
i know in you know this california case the civil or aclu i guess the american civil you know they were doing anything they could to prevent it even to going as far as
you know stating the gas chamber is not as cruel or is cruel and unusual punishment and in such that they just drag up any little thing they possible can to drag it out or whatnot you know i mean
they firing squad is what's used a firing squad yeah
do you have any particular ideas about our funding of aids research
do you think it's more important than cancer or something else simply because the numbers are so large
okay
because my thought leads to you know i have school age kids
i think a good amount of money ought to go to the education which they seem to be doing
because i think you want to stop it before it gets you know it's not the kind of thing you can reverse if you've got to stop it before it starts
something inside me upsets me to think that there're lots of diseases in my husband's family there's a genetic disease
why aren't people making a stink about that and you know and curing you know making this gung ho rally to cure that
it's a scare also
oh i'm sure it's devastating
and there is a real scare a real fear you don't know
you know how dangerous it could be i had answered a job ad we have a local va hospital down here
and they needed a lab assistant and i'm working part-time now i'm a substitute teacher
but you know i get called sporadically and they needed this lab assistance in the neighborhood and said you didn't have to have experience i'm really an artist but i figured oh you know i'll find out what it is
and she very casually said well think about whether you want to this because there are lab animals and blah and
you might be exposed to aids in the animals but you know you'd have gloves and this and that and it did make me flinch it did make me not want to do that
right
sure but i you know these were lab animals i'm not crazy about rats to begin with i mean but here's humans and you can feel compassion for them
oh i don't know
yeah i guess it people will do anything you know just because it's a job and they have to make a salary but
uh-huh
hm
the care is shoddy
right yeah how can you feel when there's a sign on your door you know i is it
there there's usually a sign on the door saying quarantined or something you know or
sure
i'm sure a big part of it is they suffer mentally as well as physically
yeah you know it just when i when i see a headline that says that we're giving twenty five billion to russia because you know they need to eat better and then we've got so many problems at home
where is this you know my husband says well they're printing up more you know i don't know where is it coming from do they ask us
well i don't know how we could spend it when we owe so much i don't understand
you know you would think it balances you know you don't have it you can't spend it but we seem to it's a mystery
so i guess you're saying you think we should spend more for aids research
i'm not i don't really know what we are spending actually
well i hate to think there's a you know it seems that anytime a bureaucracy works on something they waste a lot of money on administration costs
and a study of how to do this can cost millions of dollars
right
i imagine
well hi bob
hi my lawn and garden well that that's quite a topic because basically my husband takes care of it
but what he's done is he's done a raised garden in the back yard because that we don't have dirt around here you understand that it's sludge it's mud it's cruddy
so you know instead of trying to break every rototiller that we ever rented we've just decided to do the raised garden and it works out great he just built like a twelve by eight box
out of lumber that's you know the wolmanized lumber and it's i guess it's maybe oh say eighteen inches wide so it makes a really nice box set that on top of the dirt
and then worked and worked and worked with the soil i mean bag after bag from wolfe nursery to fill it up
but over the years it has produced some of the best vegetables and garden you know type things that
boy it's been really great and right now we have tomatoes out there and we've got you know have eggplant we're growing corn grows great here so we really enjoy that a lot
oh
right
yeah oh those oh yeah we've given up on those ourselves
yeah i guess we've got an early grow variety or something like that and they're just now you know starting to turn red so hopefully before all this heat hits
we'll have some tomatoes
uh-huh
right yeah
definitely
um-hum
yeah
i think that'd be really pretty really nice
oh
oh
oh
oh
that would be a good idea
yeah
well that you know one project we're looking at is we're building a deck out back and we want to put a tree in and we've been looking around and maybe you could you know suggest something but
the tree that we've sort of you know come upon is a bradford pear and we wanted it for shade and we wanted it you know for the leaf and that's
you know
right it it's yeah it's ornamental
right that's true
oh red bud
um-hum
that would be a great shade tree then
um-hum
but as long as you mow the grass around well you said it was around rocks but
oh
well that's just in the springtime too isn't it
oh
yeah
oh that's interesting get to know all these things
well that's interesting yeah i know that we've done some other things with the grass and trying to
you know get the right combination of grass here
because it's
and they had planted bermuda and then when they took the cement walkways out they stuck in what is that saint augustine stuff
and i am a transplant here from the north myself and so when i saw that saint augustine i said oh weeds and i spent i mean weeks just pulling it up bag by bag
until i went to the nursery one day and found out they were selling it by plugs you know and i could have made some money on all those big huge black bags of stuff i'd thrown out so we're trying to
after this winter we had a lot of winter kill and hopefully you know some of the bermuda will take over and because i really like that grass
yeah that yeah the grubs
um-hum
well good maybe i can learn something
do you well it is fun what little i do of course i don't you know i think when they refer to different kinds of fishing i told my husband last night when i called and they had told me that this was a topic
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
do you have a boat
um-hum
i think the lakes are probably different in michigan than they are in texas the ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock
but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the where they call the good fishing holes you know
is it
uh-huh my in-laws live on a lake a little bit east of dallas kind of in the piney woods and the lake is beautiful and i like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish but
actually catching fish to eat per se you don't really do much of that right there i catch a lot of little old i think they call them perch
i would be afraid of that
uh-huh
are they poisonous snakes
uh-huh
yeah i think i'd be a little bit afraid of those
um-hum
it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know great big snake and it course it scared the women to death you know but the men come out and said oh well that's only a king snake it won't really hurt you know
but it looked so bad and it was so big that it might not would have hurt us but we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there you know but they're scary looking
um-hum now they have a lot of bass tournaments
um-hum
oh no
um-hum well that's kind of we've never entered a tournament or anything we're not that big into fishing but i see a lot of people you know early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out and they'll say well there's a big bass tournament this weekend and all those people are here for the tournament you know
so i think there's a lot of people that have you know really i guess that you'd call it really sport fishing they're really into it to try to win
but it is it's very a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out in on the water and looking around the peace and calmness is really relaxing
um-hum now i've never tried taking a book with me i'll have to try that one of these days
the way the way i see it in the in the last article i read was that i think us ought to spend the same amount of money that we're spending but i think the states need to take advantage of it more than they are
because i know the article i read stated that texas had what was it like eleven not a million but like a hundred and ten thousand
offered to it or more than that and it didn't take advantage of all the money that it was offered
because the state that i'm in has is the fourth largest in aids cases
and it's just not taking advantage of the money that's being provided
well there's well we have we have our you know that we have i guess a fair share and it's
spreading outside of the homosexual community
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
well also because it's so new
and cancer and such doesn't spread as readily to other people as it does as aids does
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's true
i hadn't i hadn't thought about that
um-hum
well i think
a lot of a lot i mean this is a this is a an a totally new experience we haven't come really ever come across at least not in my like time that you know where we've come across a disease that has spread this rapidly
and that we've you know is changing i know just in the last three months the cdc has come back and redefined aids
you know and so i mean it's very difficult to put a cure on something that you keep expanding
and we you know and all the new you know things that we keep finding you know that you can be hiv positive for you know now what have they bumped it up to eleven years now
yeah you know
um-hum
um-hum
so
are you a freshwater or
freshwater
um-hum
most of my fishing has been in the saltwater
huh
mostly deep sea fishing for
grouper and bottom fish
and
huh i have caught
one or two small sharks
and yes
no i love shark steak
but the ones i caught were never large enough to really do anything
is there a limit i have no idea i know i my home is in pensacola florida so
it's they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf
and a certain period of time during the year they have
all along the gulf coast from i guess from galveston to mayport they have shark tournaments and you know there's part either as part of or separate from
the bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done much freshwater fishing not
oh for you know lake fishing for bass and so forth but maybe some what they call brim and those sorts of things but
nothing i think i've been trout fishing once
i've never fly fished have you fly fished
well i've tried it once yes a friend of mine
no
i could never get the hang of it
uh-huh
i usually ended snagging
my
the trees along the bank
oh no i used when i was
working in florida i used to do a lot of surf fishing
mostly for relaxation
you know there are
there are people who fish and then there are people who catch
that's right i i've never caught that much but
oh and occasionally we'd go out on a you know
full day trip you know three or four other people and do
either again bottom fishing or for grouper or i used to catch you know i've caught a few
worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth
what about you a
um-hum
oh yes
the last time i went
bass fishing i was with my daughter
a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter
we
i was the only one
who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish he caught fish
i did not even i did not even i have been
i was out on a
party boat a few years ago and we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were snapper fishing
everyone on the boat
was catching
snapper
snappers
except
that's right i would go from one side of the boat to the other and
the party boat captain could not understand
i enjoy it though i don't really get out as much as i as i would like too and
they do of course you know here in we're only just a you know few not a few minutes we're you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in maryland
and they do a lot of fishing there of course what i used to like to do though is
go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or
or for oysters
and that i was able to do when i could go in and go down and
actually pick them off the bottom
that's right
um-hum
um-hum
hm
uh-huh
uh-huh
well we used to i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught is in
some of the
inlets and the rivers around rehoboth delaware
they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker i don't know if you've ever heard of it
and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually use their teeth to open oysters
um-hum
and this is the ugliest
fish i have ever seen and i and they come in all you know i've caught them from you know three or four inches long
up to i guess the largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible
no
um-hum
and i threw my line out
and then i
felt something relatively heavy and i thought oh really here i'm really going to get one
and i pulled
all right now since i'm from the great
midwest north you know we're right on lake erie
i'm sure our climates are much different than yours are
typically today we've got rain we're forecasting a little bit of sleet
and which means i'm not gonna do any lawn and gardening today that's for sure
so i don't know what's the weather down there and
uh-huh
yeah
yeah it's not
uh-huh
well i have that
i still have that we have mums and geraniums that are still holding their own out there lot of the other ones i've already had to pull out
at this point i'm ready to start putting in some bulbs i'm waiting for a decent some decent weather for that i got about two hundred bulbs i've got to put in
but i have a
mine's a new home and we just really did the landscaping this year so i've got
about all the gardening i want for the year so i'll be anxious to let it rest for a little bit
but somebody i talked to last week was said they had the they had problems doing some of the work down there because they really had some heat hanging on
um-hum
yeah all right
uh-huh
um-hum
oh i see
uh-huh
that's very okay it's very different than ours because ours we get into a lot of combinations of rye and kentucky blue
and plus the usual amount of crabgrass weeds and everything else that pops through and
but we've had an a terrible drought this year and everybody's going through the same kind of problems in fact we developed on a new lawn we developed what they call rust
and it's a fungus which is very rare but our whole area they're all new homes and new lawns and it was it was very
very much in evidence this year as everything turns yellow
well it just turns yellow where it shouldn't and you walk across walk across the lawn and your shoes will actually come out rust colored
no it's a fungus and they claim that it is caused by stress to the lawn it won't kill the lawn but it sure doesn't do much for the looks of the lawn
and the alternative is a lot of nitrogen overpowering with nitrogen fertilizer and
certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
you enjoy lawn work
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
oh i
okay
um-hum
yeah that's interesting i never realized the amount of lake
yes we do my wife and i have a dog that's soon be eight years old and we have a cat which is i guess about five years old
how about you guys
three dogs and two what kind of birds you have
no kidding enjoy them
you let you let them out and let them fly around everything
oh okay
we you know this is like a cruelty joke and i apologize if you're a bird lover but we had a parakeet
and my fault put up our first electric fan and never thought about it knocked that parakreet right out of the air
it kill it
oh that's no it killed ours i'll be darned
well speaking of pets i'll tell you my kids are older now my both of them are either in or out of college but
but we had for years about five years i guess had a my son had a burmese boa constrictor and
that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in length and finally my wife's wife bless her heart got rid of it because i didn't really like it
and we also had a one year down in florida on a vacation for father's day my kids years ago maybe ten years ago go bought me a skunk from a like exotic pet shop it'd be like it'd had been like deactivated as far as
smell and everything and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years and my son left
went to school we finally sold his boa constrictor but my son needed some money and we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars so ah
so when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk so i made him a deal i said you take that skunk
and it was sort of a neat but they just stink too much
and the skunk would be sitting at her feet
oh gosh
oh
oh me neither
we're down to a simple dog and cat now and that's the way it should be and haven't had any parakeets for quite a while or birds customer of mine has a parrot
and gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot and that was just mind boggling
are you
uh-huh
yes
oh gosh
why sure
okay
well carolyn the
one of the main things i'd like to know is
how do you feel about the knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth what do you think would be required and so forth
oh you knew of the homes then you knew of the homes themselves
uh-huh
oh okay
yeah
well from your point of view how would you feel about actually sending someone that that's you know means something to you to one of those homes i realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it and of course that makes sense but
how do you think they would feel i should say about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new home situation
uh-huh
oh okay
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
well how do you find that your personal relationship is with her know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal does that does that cause any problems between the two of you
uh-huh is she
it's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life
yeah
it is different i had that almost similar situation my mother lives in an apartment with my sister
and
so i except for the three or four months this summer that's the only time i ever spent with my mother and
of course since i see her only once or twice a year i was just thrilled to have her here with me and i spent every minute i could to be with her and cooking foods for her you know just to make her life as though she were on vacation
but somehow another it that doesn't work between my mom and my sister and they find they are
so it's it puts has put pressure on both of them from that point of view
so that's kind of bad news and by the same token my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home
and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm into another home where the environment is totally different
she's relatively happy but she doesn't like the food and when she complains about the food then everybody gets angry with her so that's another one of those things you have to solve
yeah after all their life is so totally different because in those early days
the food they had to make it from scratch so to speak i mean you raised your own chickens and you killed your own hogs i suppose and then they had to store the meat in
i don't want to say barns but they had regular little places they would hang it you know to cure it and so forth and
and now all of a sudden it comes in differently it tastes differently
yeah i do too of course
they're all just for themselves mostly
um-hum
um-hum
you know oh stuff that happened many years ago in their lives i think that's awful
yeah
right
um-hum
but
it'd be hard i don't know
what to say really about politicians like i say i just
i just can't believe too many of them at all
and i read you know about them and everything about different ideas they all seem to have something wrong with them
oh the one that just got out of agnus uh-huh um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah he wasn't in office very long was he
you know
oh
oh well what did this marriage you've got now over there what did he
what was he going to do that was different
that sounds funny doesn't it
so what do you think about oakland's mayor
i mean oakland seems like they have an awful lot of problems there
you know have you lived there long
uh-huh um-hum
yeah i know that should i say have a lot of in fact more mortgage and every thing this year than they did
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
well not necessarily in dallas but it's a very short drive to areas near here
well i have done camping in the past
i can't remember when the last time i actually went camping was it was several years ago and then i did most of my camping in the mountains
well it is i enjoy hiking and camping we went to the sangre de cristos i have some land there and so it's handy to station yourself there on the land and then
make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and overnight camping
do you do most of yours in tents
oh wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
doesn't that always taste so much better when you're out like that yeah
uh-huh
that's right if you don't you'll find every rock on it when you
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh what a clever idea i wouldn't have thought about that
oh that's a good idea
um-hum well if you get a chance now there are some really nice camping areas up in the wichitas which is in oklahoma and arkansas
i can't remember the name it's on the oklahoma arkansas border
and it won't take but just a you know just a quick look at a map to find
where those mountains are but i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last september just took the drive through to see what was there they have some wonderful camping areas there beautiful country
uh-huh
yeah
right well lake tawakoni is a pretty nice place
and we had a two bedroom mobile home there but the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitoes bit and then they came in
oh they're grown now
they go camping on their own once you start them they enjoy it all their lives
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh don't be concerned there's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh well it's easy to keep him occupied though on land i know that i took my kids we'd go out and i'd have them walk with me along the lakefront and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell and
or we'd hunt pine cones or we climbed some pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts
you know the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find
uh-huh i had my boys build their own little you know three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark
and we cooked in a pot i baked them a cake right there on a camp fire they were so impressed i used a tire chain and the bottom of a dutch oven
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-oh
well if our time is up we can quit
uh-huh
okay uh-huh
you bet bye-bye
uh-huh
oh okay
oh okay
well i'm a student that's why i was asking and i
i haven't been working this semester
yeah i have i wear a uniform a nursing uniform
so i don't really have much choice
yeah they tend to be pretty expensive
yeah they should unless you just buy a few and wear keep wearing those all the time
and yeah and people tend to use bleach on them because you know you want them to stay white and that kind of deteriorates it a little bit
and
there's not much of a selection at least in my price range like styles or things so
yeah
oh okay
that sure does yeah were you a receptionist oh okay
yeah definitely
uh-huh that sounds good
right also the shoes are expensive that
yeah that's really tough before i went back to school i worked as a
wore dresses and things like that so i mean it was for a nonprofit organization
so
right
yeah
um-hum
yeah she never wore high she's an engineer she never yeah she never wore high heels just
flats and low heels
um-hum more of a classic look yeah see that doesn't have to be uncomfortable
yeah but you're right i think those things tend to be more expensive
yeah
uh-huh
right
um-hum
i know
what do you think on a scale of one to ten where would you rate yourself on gun control
most and ten being no restrictions at all
it's not it's not fair to just kind of do everything all the same with all guns because they're not all the same you know
like hand guns and assault rifles i think are a little bit different than rifles and shotguns
so
and you don't need three hundred rounds a minute to get hold of a deer and
um-hum
i mean it's not like you're gonna go hey i'll go hunting today
and usually if you're gonna go hunting it's pretty early in the morning anyway and the store is not gonna be open so
um-hum
yeah they don't
i guess i mean the only thing that i question is i mean i think if it was really easy to enforce that it would be great the only thing that would worry me about it
is that the only real way that i know to enforce it is if someone commits a crime while having a weapon that's not registered you can tag on a couple of extra years
but as it is now you put someone in prison and they're out in you know one fifth the time they were sentenced to anyway
so i mean they're not they're not even staying in prison without the extra years on there much less i don't think they'd be staying any longer with extra years tagged on there
um-hum i think you might've had the i guess i mean i'm that's got to be part of gun control but i like the idea of the waiting period because
i don't think that i mean i really think that if someone wants to get a gun to commit a crime they're gonna get a gun but
if someone is just like all hot and bothered and ready to go out and get someone just because they're all charged up emotionally
that a three day waiting period you're not gonna stay that angry for that long
yeah
yeah
hook
oh yeah there seems to be a lot out especially around christmas but we were
kind of busy and didn't really get out to see any of them
the last one i went to the theater to see was the doctors
and i thought that was real good
but i rent movies all the time
yeah the one that seems to be the way we do it any more i saw dying young over the weekend
and last week
what's her name julia roberts
and it was just really good
i knew it was going to be sad and i knew somebody was going to be dying
but it was is still has an interesting plot twist to it
yeah trying to
i have been putting off to go see that one but my wife wants to see it too
it just seems so much trouble any more to go to a theater
yeah
oh yeah i
yeah i went i went to the theater to see that one and then i rented it i think when it came out too
yeah
sometimes you're right it doesn't
but it beats watching what ever is on television
yeah
we had a pretty quiet christmas at our house this year and one of the things that we've been putting off for a long time was to was to rent all of the godfather movies
so we did that
it was you know like fourteen hours of godfather stuff
no it took us about three days but
yeah well it was still lots i'm telling you when that the last hour you know number three
we felt like we were italians we were eating italian snacks and drinking wine and we were thinking this has got to stop
there's three
yeah it's almost something around fourteen hours
but i think my favorite though are old movies black and white
i like the old prison movies in the thirties and things like that
it's just i don't know there's just something about them i think it reminds me of my childhood
so somehow that reminds me again with all my brothers and sisters and you know making popcorn and making homemade pizzas in the middle of the night and stuff so
yeah
i watched doris day retrospective on cbs the other night just
i thing about her and different movies she'd been in and i realized how much i missed the old doris day rock hudson movies
they were just always i can remember never missing one at the theater
and because they were like fantasy and they were an escape from the real world i think and even if i see one on now or somewhere i'll want to watch it so
yeah i am still here yes
i am in a rest area and i was just kind of looking somebody went by there i
yeah to tennessee it's my mother's eighty fifth birthday
kingsport
you know where that is
oh yeah are they still there
yeah
yeah i remember back when they first open in the early seventies there i worked at univac and just down the road and boy all the everybody just
credit cards
yeah
sounds like a good you ready to get started
okay
i know when i was younger twenty years ago or so i got into quite a bit of hassle with them charging to the limit like to never caught them up
yeah
yeah
i've had oh one time i had an erroneous charge show up on it from some
credit card protection company or something and that took me a few months to get that reimbursed and find out what was going on there they had authorized they had paid somebody without my authorization
and
boy
yeah i've never gotten into an interest
never gotten into an interest charge with american express i know they have it but i just
you know if you get it paid within the next thirty days or something you don't have one so
yeah
yeah it's kind of hard to get by without one you know it's
i rent a lot of videos you got to have one there and different places and so you just about got to have a major credit card my favorites though are department store credit cards
you can just stop in and shop when you want and don't have to worry about your check book or having cash
and
when you have a balance you pay it and
there's never a problem with anything you want or anything and our give the cards to my sons say here go get what you want
that sort of thing
so those kind of particular credit cards i've always liked
yeah
right when i work that's the way we i had a
corporate card with american express with my company and
everything was put on that they didn't care what was put on there just
and i usually
i think one time in all those years i had a situation where my refund check you know my reimbursement checks hadn't gotten here in time to make you know a payment of five or six thousand i had every month too and
i mean just one time
yeah is that it okay well we i guess we have to talk about magazines and what
well i subscribe to well i did subscribe to people for a long time i do you know i enjoy people and now i'm i subscribe to ladies home journal
uh-huh
okay are you interested in computers
yeah
uh-huh yeah well that would be one of my peeves my pet peeves with magazines the woman's magazines especially i mean it it's really
geared to all they have is you have too many recipes first of all i just don't you know that's what i don't like about ladies home journal magazines
too many recipes too many can this marriage be saved nonsense i you know i like to read articles about things that matter well of course people magazine is not you know one of your
well that's true yeah they did
yeah
well is redbook still in existence i didn't know if they were if they were around anymore
that's it
oh yeah oh uh-huh
yeah
right
uh-huh
it's light reading you know you don't have well you don't have to concentrate you know you know it's entertaining you know and
that's i just i enjoy it i you know i
well that entertainment is very wasn't that similar or isn't it similar to the tv guide
oh i see
right
oh
right
maybe i'll read two maybe three if i read three articles in you know one of the journals i figure you know i did really well
uh-huh
well that's good
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i that that's oh you mean you switched schools for the kids uh-huh
well i'm just recently married so i don't have any children though we plan on having them soon but i think
i think that i that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties i think i'm lucky though that
there probably will be a possibility that i could stay home two days that she would go to work and that i would have to teach at night
yeah so it will probably workout real nice for us i think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules
they're number one priority was that they're children didn't have to leave their home so they my sister-in-law is a
a clinical speech pathologist so she is i guess her most recent position after she returned back to work
she applied for a director's position and got it so i guess she's very well qualified for her field i guess and even though she took off two years for
i guess four years all together it would be three years how old's kayla three yeah i guess she took off three years all together
for because i guess they have a four year old and yeah and my nephew's two almost two so i guess she took off three all together and then when she decided to go back to work
she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home
yeah i think they were really lucky there but i think they've lost this woman she will not continue and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school
so i don't know what they are going to do
um-hum
yeah i think i think they they're both they were both professionals unlike me they're they'll my they were married
my brother's five years younger then she is so she was probably twenty seven when they were married so she already had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a in a practice almost
where you know he then they waited a couple years and he got himself pretty far along i guess they didn't have kids until he was about twenty six so by that time she was so well
established you know i guess it made it a lot easier but i think the longer you wait the easier the easier it is if you have that
that professional occupation where you can change
yeah
yeah that's right that's true yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yep yeah definitely
we're safe yeah
um-hum
yeah that's you know that's so important i
i guess
it's so funny now with schools you know they don't take kid into kindergarten and when i guess when they're five and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now and they don't let them into kindergarten unless they can
count to ten and they know their abcs and i think that's so funny because
i don't i don't know if i want school's very important i'm an educator myself and my wife teaches and i it's a very important part of your life and i hope to read with my kids but i don't know if i want my kids to go to school at four
or three you know i can see that when you make that point
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah
uh-huh that's a really important point
yeah
i think that's really that's important i i've seen the same thing i think you're exactly right because you know i've gone or before i was married i went out with a girl and you know
boy after you know after about two months i realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems and i bet and they could be traced back to just not being you know being moved between
um-hum
that's true
uh-huh
um-hum
yep that's true yeah that's really true
um-hum
yeah i think i'm very lucky because of having you know flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule
i teach a computer classes so it's one of things where i'm paid a little bit better then a history or an english professor and i'm also you know they have vocational type courses on weekends
almost everywhere and you know you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a saturday which means that you know whole week's worth of courses so that lets you be available three days during the week
you know because my dad had very nine to five type job with forty five minute commute into the city and a forty five commute home so by the time he got home he was so tired and
he was all rung out from the day and i think he missed a lot of our up bringing you know my mother i came from a family that my mother stayed home until we started school
for it
it's probably costing you a fortune
my goodness if you want them to be able to drive the car the insurance bill
oh
um-hum
yeah
carpools uh-huh
yeah my parents did a lot of that
that's right yep and just to save you trips to and from you know ball games and athletic events and activities at the school yeah isn't that something how you know you think about child care and it lasts along time
well normally they come in
oh cause they'll come in ten minutes normally and stop us
well you don't have to but they you go the length and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes
depends on how old the tapes are at that time
uh-huh
yeah
this is baltimore maryland
yeah well most of most of the people i talk to are from texas
uh-huh yeah and i've discussed i've discussed
from the newspapers and we keep the newspapers in a in a their collected twice a month
one for the regular trash one for the you know bottles and cans and one for the newspapers
no they do that on the truck they separate them as they as they you know dump them and you know one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there
you must have come to washington at least once
my you've got a lot a lot of nothing out there
well isn't that that's pretty upscale trash situation i don't think anybody around here would understand all the all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals
hum
hum
well that certainly you know getting into the swim of things
i think it should be it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know but more than that every week you've got to pay by the pound
i think i think people would be would get very you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
well of course that you know those big trucks can probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
okay well what do you think do you
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
um-hum
right that's true
right
that's true
right but
um-hum yeah but he has to go out and do it that's true i think
right and see that's my only problem with making you
you know get the check and everything is i guess bad guys if you want to call them bad guys they are going to get a gun no matter what
they're not i don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check i think they're going to go out and find it someway individual sale or something like that
yeah i hope that's true
knives exactly
he's going to do what he wants to do that's true i just think it makes the honest people more honest and
yeah
yeah i was watching a
yeah they do they do
right
the little toy guns look real i mean i've heard so much about that on tv and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one
yeah
right
um-hum
right i mean you can't blame them it looks like they've got a weapon
that's right
exactly
right and i think that's a good idea
that's right i know
right
a gun's a gun to them they can play with anything make it a gun that's exactly right
right
right exactly
that's right that's a good idea well i was watching tv yesterday and there's a town in georgia
and it's the law that you have a gun every adult
you know is able to carry a gun and they encourage it yeah and the police love it which really surprised me and i and i think and that's what they were going after
they went to interview this town i mean it's a little dinky town they went to interview them about the gun control laws
and the police said all the people said that's fine we care less you know we're all honest and everything like that we all carry them but we don't mind being checked and i think it kind of took that
neatness away from it you know like well heck everybody's got one you know and
so it was it was quite unusual to see the people in that town
um-hum
right
exactly
um-hum
yeah
right
that's what we're doing
oh yeah
oh
um-hum
well that's neat well that's real neat
right
well that's real good
right and it's and they usually are real basic
common sense things
i know and people don't want to believe that
yeah it was fair i took the clip out or whatever and
about her daddy's guns what not to do and what to do around them
yeah and she and she's real
and she'll know she'll even tell her little friends don't ever you know touch my daddy's guns or something like that so she's real she's real good about it and she's never been curious
i mean because he's always you know if he's has them out cleaning them you know she can be there and he'll tell her how he's doing it or you know show her the insides and stuff like that
to be feared and
right exactly
right they have to have that respect for what it does and what it can do
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
right
boy if someone did break in i don't i don't know that i could or would even grab it
um-hum that's true
yeah
yeah right
yes
right
yeah
right and that's one of them so well
yeah really does well do you think we've
me too on gun control
yeah i think we are
well liz do you own a boat
um-hum
where do you sail at
how large is your boat
um-hum
that's too bad we've got a boat it isn't a sail boat my i should say my family does also
it's a it's a fishing and ski boat it'll hold about seven people
but we have a lot of fun every year we get together for a week down on a place it's kind of a resort we have a time share down there and take the boat and
water ski and go fishing early in the mornings when the water's cold and
it's a lot of fun and even the little kids enjoy it i've got
a six year old and of course some of the other family has some around eight or ten and we have a great big oh it'll hold about probably five or six kids that size it's a big
kind of like a water weenie that floats in the water and they can all get on it at once
and they just have a blast we put a life jacket on everybody and then you know just pull them around and
we burn up a tank or two of gas a day
but my experience with boating and at least that way i don't know the sailing might be different i don't know i think i'd kind of be too impatient to
to sail but i don't know it might be kind of fun too just to
relax and i guess it's all wind powered isn't it when you sail
um-hum
hm
uh-huh
yes
um-hum
um-hum
sure
hm
um-hum
hm
well do you just drop an anchor when you find a place or do you just kind of let it go and you do take an anchor then and
um-hum
oh
how large is your boat how many how many people could go on it at once
um-hum
are they set up so you can spend the night in them and
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's is a tremendous burden to be working and have two kids to take care of
and i don't know how you did it but i have a six year old that's well she's in first grade and then i have a three and a half year old and
i have always been a big advocate of spending tons of time with my kids
and when i my first one when she was born i had to work part-time for a while because we had to have the extra money
but when the second one came along i was fortunate enough that i quit and i've been able to stay home and
i spend the whole day with tara and we go and do things and we read books and we play and you know it's just it's great and i did the same thing with taylor
who's my first grader she's also a girl and i think i can tell a real difference taylor has excelled in school like i just
i never imagined she would she's at the top of her class in everything even though she's almost two year younger than almost all the kids in her class
and i really feel like that time i spent with her i mean she probably already had a lot
of it in her but you know we spent a whole lot of time together reading books and doing a lot of things i think it helped her to feel real good about herself and
so it's been real rewarding for me anyway
oh i'm sure
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah
but at least i'm really making the most of the time while they're little and everything taylor even attempts to do you know we go and watch her and
and support her and that was something my parents weren't able to do and i resented that because i would be in i was always in plays in high school and in all kinds of drama and they could never come and watch me and that just
it was so hard for me so i made a vow that when i had kids no matter what they did i was going to be there you know
and see them do it so it and like you said it's fun i really enjoy it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
right yeah
yeah
yeah i know well i feel i feel really thankful that i can i mean we have had to really lower our standard of living you know we have friends who have beautiful homes and we have a very small old house
i just i have been willing to make the sacrifices and my husband has too and so it's not been a problem for us
right
well it's interesting we're real involved with a church group and so most of our friends are church friends
and they're the majority of them do stay home almost all of my friends i can call any time of day and they're home
but the friends that i've kept in contact with from you know when i did work and they're still working moms you know that
i feel like i real big difference in opinion with some of them because some of them work just because they enjoy working you know they don't really have to work they just want to they like to get out and
but most of my friends do stay home so that it's kind of nice we have a big support group around here
i guess you just get used to you know living however you have to live to
yeah
right yeah
yeah well i intend to i think when they're both in school i may i have a degree to teach and i've never used it because i was pregnant when i graduated from college and i've always had you know been home with kids or worked part-time
but i might go into like substitute teaching or something because
yeah and i can choose they say as a substitute you can tell them the days that you're interested and you know the days you're not you don't have to so
yeah
yeah
yeah it'll probably make a whole difference and plus i didn't feel well at the time i was pregnant and i was real sick and
yeah i and you just don't feel like being around all these little kids when you are just sick to your stomach
but anyway it's been nice talking to you
and thanks for calling bye
okay
i know i guess that
i guess you consider just things that every day that would you'd think of about see i'm a college student so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me
you know that i think's like is an invasion of my privacy stuff like that but i think it'd be it is kind of a tough topic
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh you're like no you don't no
uh-huh
yeah
they call late now i mean now there's i heard that they were going to start calling on saturdays or
see that's i would be so mad
really
huh
huh
really huh i don't know i'd think like things that i think's like privacy is like just like not going through my stuff but like going through just like my clothes or my drawer just going through my stuff basically
that drives me up a wall
no see we're not and
yeah she'll take all my shirts and stuff because she can't wear like my pants but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff
man i'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses you know
but still she'll just take them and she won't even think about it and then i'll like see her that day and she'll be wearing my clothes and i'll be like you know i don't like to borrow my clothes out you know i really don't
so i prefer that you just not go in and get them because she doesn't even ask me
stuff like that when you have your door closed people just walking in and stuff like that
i was thinking like my mom i know this she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff we always just give her purse you know and she'll get it out or whatever
i was trying to think i was thinking that's the only thing i could really think of that would really be
really
uh-huh
yeah get out of my cabinets
uh-huh
see
yeah
you could you know you put your stuff where it's yeah
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
then you start missing stuff and
see that would that would make me really mad because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff just because i mean i know i have everything like a certain way
and you know how it looks and everything
uh-huh
that would bother me definitely
uh-huh
see yeah
you know that's the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy like something every day though
uh-huh
oh really
uh-huh
yeah okay
no i don't do you
oh okay
yeah i work for ncnb
and let's see the question was what benefits you consider most important i think definitely medical and dental insurance
life insurance long-term disability vacation
yeah and
i think what i don't like some of the policies that our company has that i don't like i don't like their sick leave policy their short-term disability policy and i would like to see them do something about child care
oh it's only like i don't know like six days a year which is way below the national average
yeah
no
um-hum
that's not even two days that's not even two days and what if you get the flu and you're sick for a week or two
oh no
yeah
wow
i think you know people get sick and if you get sick usually you're sick for more than a day and then you know if your children get sick
you know parents have to take time off for that and
yeah
and i think you know it varies from manager to manager some managers keep track of it and some managers don't and it's really unfair you know
you know it's getting to the point where you just can't afford it anymore
um-hum
right there yes
yes very much very much
um-hum
and i think they should even do something for when children are sick you know provide facilities for sick children
although i know that's not very comfortable for the children when they're sick they probably just would rather stay home but
you know and that's about it you know a lot of times i don't have the option of staying home you know i just can't you know there's something going on that day or you know that i have to be there for
and i know a lot of what i do like though is i see a lot of men taking off and they take turns with their wives
and
i got that when i started because i was because i'm an officer of the company
so it depends on if you're an if you're not an officer it depends on how long you've been there i think you get like a week your first year and then two weeks and then you have to be there like five years to get three weeks or four years
and then officers just start out at three weeks and then they go up to four weeks
depending on i'm real happy with the vacation i guess you know you could take vacation days if you had to stay home but
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
i've heard of companies that do that
ooh
yeah and you have to use your vacation pay for that
oh can you collect unemployment
do they
yeah
well that's yeah that's not very good are you satisfied with your insurance
does your company pay for it or do you pay for it
do you have flexible benefits where you can get sort of like pick and choose
um-hum
well i think our insurance we have to pay for part of it and the company pays for part of it but
it's expensive but i don't think it's out of line with what other company you know with what other companies do it's just that in general it's expensive
and i you know i don't i don't like it do you have four o one k
yeah
well that's good
how
really
for a new job
ours will only match twenty five yeah for up to ten percent of your salary
oh okay well then i guess that's makes a difference
yeah
well that's good
yeah
yeah i'm glad that we that we have that the company that i worked for before ncnb was just they were just starting it and i think that's i think that's great
well yeah because retirement plans now are so bad i don't know about your company but our company tries to keep base salaries low and they compensate employees more with bonuses
and incentive pay rather than raises because it cuts down on their expenses for the pension plan because your pension's going to be based on what your salary was
not what your salary plus bonuses where and your bonuses cut ultimately end up being fifty percent of your salary
so
yeah
but more and more companies are going to that now
really
gosh that's pretty bad especially with you know inflation and i i've noticed that the cost of living i've lived in dallas now for three years and the cost of living has just gone up incredibly in that three years that i've been here
yeah your housing mostly i guess is where i notice it
but you know in you know kids kid's get more expensive as they
yeah how about you
well like
i don't know i think that i one of the reasons that i'm against it is that i'm afraid of someone losing their life for wrongly
right and another reason one of the arguments that really i really actually have been kind of ambivalent about it but one of the arguments that really made me feel kind of strongly against it is that
you know someone said to me once well imagine if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her wouldn't you want to see them killed
how about you
yeah that's true
um-hum
right well you know that's true because but a lot of these conversations i've had on this program this
these telephone conversations have revolved around
criminal
you know justice or whatever and most of the time i hear myself saying well you know we don't have enough room left in the jails and people crime is still climbing we need to have stiffer punishments you know but i just am scared of capital punishment i guess
um-hum
right especially when it's so far removed if it's no one that i know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life
um-hum
uh-huh
that's true you know i just recently moved to massachusetts i'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment and that was one of the questions but
i do know that they are notorious for paroling people yeah when they're when and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes
and i guess they said you know do you think it should be restricted i guess if it were if because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment i guess violent crimes would be the
crimes where i can see it making the most sense you know violent crimes with no with just malicious intent
yeah
right
well i was i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back she was off drugs and everything but she said you know
in prison you can get anything you can get any drugs you want there's you it's just like being outside you know people find ways around and there's a power structure that you have to bow to and
and it really isn't for some people who have been there for over and over and over it really isn't as i mean there it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect
but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation and
maybe that's why one of the reasons why crime has gone up because it's not so scary anymore
right and what they're going to be doing when they get out
oh i see
well maybe if they could if they had more money or more resources to work more on rehabilitation i mean deep down i think every human
oh
right
yeah i think that that's the only thing i wrote down also because that's just a
yes i know -at's true
yeah that's true
but you know people
it's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls
i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day and a lot a days i'll get to and three calls from
from people selling insurance you know to the small business man
and you know i think dunn and bradstreet puts your according to what i've understand dunn and bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in new york and
california always trying to sell something oil investments or stock investments or whatever
and now i getting the same calls at the house
and they get and they get your name from dunn and bradstreet and credit card companies they sell your name
i know
yes
american express does that by the way
yeah i understand they sell you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them
and that is an invasion of privacy you're right
i know that's true
but it's you know i guess it you have to be a certain income holder to have an american express card so your name is valuable to i guess x amount of solicitors calling
so i don't know
where do you where you from
oh okay well so yeah we live in the dallas area richardson
okay laughter
did you
yeah i've got i talked to people in utah people in new york and a lot of times i'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning and i'll get people you know from out of the out of the state
i'll be darn where you from not from texas
new jersey right yeah my wife's from new jersey
yeah from saddle river
she
okay
well that's nice too
really my wife's been away we've been married twenty five years so she she's been away for quite a while
her dad was from little rock arkansas and her mother was from new york so they just
they officed over there in new jersey
so but anyway yeah this topic is it's a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy but that's the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling
i know
right
sure
you yeah you're probably right
i understand i mean i it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriff's association and
i know they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival or circus and then
right there's always a and i my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night
yes we're doing several different things and i haven't kept up to date on what's happened lately but
they have the igloos around and they have various places for different kinds of recycling
um-hum
and i understand in the future we're supposed to
begin a curbside pick up as well but that hasn't started yet
how about you
and so that seems to be helping a little bit too
oh
and you don't see the clippings lying around then huh
well now do you recycle plastic also
uh-huh
i've heard that that's something that can be started
oh is that right
right
ooh that's a good idea
oh that's great
um-hum
oh how funny well old habits die hard don't they i mean it the whole issue of
conservation and everything is i you know i talk about it all the time with my kids i'm a teacher and i
we talk about it a lot and yet there are often times i find myself doing
you know going ahead and throwing a way a plastic bottle instead of you know separating it and so forth i and i just forget
so it's a it's a effort on everybody's part i think to begin to do this and keep it up
yeah
oh
oh good
that's right
that's right and my kids help a lot my son tried to or helped build a
a little recycling center for us here at the house you know put to put the cans in and
papers and plastic and so forth so we have a little place that he built out in the garage and
so until we get curbside service we cart it all over every once in a while but they're real good about it
they're real responsible much better than i am really about sorting things out so
so they've done a real good job
oh good idea
oh that's great
and you can put it back in your copy machine and just run it on through can't you yeah
uh-huh i bet
huh
right
more people doing that yeah
um-hum
is that right
huh
i've never heard of that either
interesting
interesting
well and that the other issue is disposable diapers
and i guess some companies are beginning to do some things to where part of the diaper can be recycled or degraded
but we did an interesting thing in my classroom calculating the number of diapers that were used for my class of kids just
in the time that they would have been the age to wear diapers and the kids were just astounded
and then we calculated according to the number of kids in the school and that kind of thing and
so that you know that's a real eye-opening activity to do because you begin to think of the
thousands and millions and billions of diapers that are still there oh it's that's incredible
um-hum
that's right
yeah
the whole idea oh and you know i with my first i was all gung ho well we're going to do cloth and everything and then part way through i just gave up
uh-huh
that's one of the few things i've ever fished for is rainbow trout
what kind of bait do you use to catch them
oh really fish eggs
oh i didn't know that huh
uh-huh
oh i didn't know that's a great way
i think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish also
oh look catfish personally i like to catch large mouth bass and catfish because they fight the best
no actually i always used to go to my grandparents' in oklahoma and they have the lake texoma right next to them
so the we used to catch some sand bass off lake let's there's a roosevelt bridge and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom
and crank up you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times and the fish would be sitting at different levels
so yeah you just leave it at that level and in no time something would hit it and you could pull them up two and three times in a row but you had to find out what level how many cranks they were off the bottom
and if you left it on the bottom there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish
yeah that was a lot of fun my grandfather used to do that and we used to have a light at the top of the water
he really spoilt me in that respect
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah well if you do you have any friends with ponds
i well if you can well oh even a lake if seems like every time somebody's on the bank all they wanna do is throw it out just as far as they can
and bring it in to you but it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat you wanna make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm
and just have it come into the water like a regular animal or fish well you know something coming off from the bank like they usually do so you don't have to really get fish from a boat you know because they're actually right there at the shore
but i didn't used to be sold on plastic worms but if i am now oh yeah
yeah it just a slow reel and then let it sit on the bottom but the key is to always have your line tight
and that way you can feel when they're hitting it and believe me you'll know the difference
and you can catch blues and that's a different kind of fishing off the pier too have you ever fished off the pier
uh-huh
oh the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits
and jigs they have like yellow fuzz on a hook you know that kind of comes out
yeah
and maybe do a kind of a slow reel you don't even have to have a good rod or anything just even a regular line and you throw it out and the other thing that's real good is small
it's a real small repala it's about an inch and a half long and they're pure all silver something real shiny about that long
they'll go after that in a heartbeat also just anything that really shines or spins
oh yeah that's it
oh really that's neat
oh
yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from
or sources
that's what i would think
right
yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area
any industry that burns you know
and then i don't know about chemical pollution i'm not real
into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick
but i don't know if that affects outside
you know i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories
yeah
right
yeah that is well that's destroying the ozone isn't it yeah
yeah that's it it's kind of scary
yeah
yeah
i think something too that you probably see in older states all we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces
i think it will
uh-huh
right
right
yeah in this area too since you know in texas we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in colorado i have witnessed that where it just
it just stacks up at the when the rockies starts but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into fort worth or dallas
and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets
you don't have to have mountains there stopping it
and they make making more and more high-rise buildings and
so yeah we can comment and we didn't see this a few years ago it was pretty clear here
right
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yes and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that it's a lot of waste but
just about any kind of music except acid rock i don't care for acid rock
but i grew up with country and western but just about any kind of music i even like classical music
yeah
but i did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with james galway
oh
that was fabulous when
yeah when he played danny boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing
yeah and it was tremendous
yeah
yeah
yeah uh-huh and it was mostly all irish tunes they had a band with him that had a harpist and another flute and then
guy that played the bagpipes plus the tin whistle and a couple of violins and a drum and they
they played all the irish jigs and so forth it was just fabulous
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i love i especially like instrumentals
yeah i love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen
yeah
but
hm
hm
but i guess the closest i've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir
yeah
yeah
well like i say the acid rock i just do not and i don't care for rap music either
huh-uh no
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
but i and i love i look at the orchestra music too like the boston pops or anything
uh-huh
yeah
yeah they're good
and we went and saw les miserables
oh the music in that was fantastic
yeah
yeah it
i can't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets but it was out you know out at the state fair music hall
and it was well worth the price yeah
yeah
just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one and
we went and saw i think it was sugar babies that was good that had good music in it
that was the one with mickey rooney and oh what's that real oh not real old well she is old too dancer
i can't think of her name i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it helen something
real long legs and dark hair
yeah
but
yeah
oh yeah
blackwoods
yeah
alabama
but i
yeah either alabama or hank williams junior
i never neither and i never have figured out how he won the entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row
yes
yeah
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western or singer is probably eddy arnold
hm
but i got i've got about a hundred and or had a some i sold some of them i had about a hundred and fifty old
seventy eight rpm records of country and western songs
smiley burnette i don't know if you're old enough to remember him
he was played in the old western movies he was the sidekick of gene autry i believe or they i think his name when in the movie was froggy
had a real raspy voice
and some of those old ones of course bob wills and his texas playboys and ernest tubbs and
red foley and
yeah i took them up here to collectors rector records and was able to get a little money for them
but
my mother and dad used to own a restaurant and they had a they had a nickelodeon of course in the restaurant and when they would come and change the records
the guys would and the guy would give her the old records
so
that's where i learned about
yeah course there's not a whole lot of market for seventy eight rpm records
well the problem is that most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that particular kind of needle
and they just won't play on a
modern day
phonograph
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah they warped real easy
yeah
no
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
but i guess you know the old country and western music you back then when i was a kid there wasn't that much tv so that's all you had to listen to was the radio
and
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i remember mother and dad always turned on the grand ole opry
and
yeah
i seems like it was on a friday or
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
some things we like to do together with our family are in the summer time we like to go to parks we
well mostly just play parks yeah so
with the with the kids and such we don't get a lot of vacationing in so we just like to take little weekend trips and go to parks and such
so
oh uh-huh
yep when i was a teenager i spent some time with my cousins in dallas
uh-huh
well we like to
weekends
no we're not into skiing it's just too expensive we
and do that so we've done that quite a bit this winter and we like to play board games together sometimes it's a little difficult with the younger one
but the three older boys we have some fun times with those after the little girls go to bed
oh yes
yeah he's really patient though he with us he's a real fun twelve year old so
but he's rapidly approaching teenagehood so we'll see what happens
oh
oh
oh uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh how fun
oh
oh
yeah
yes i think that is good that sounds
uh-huh
now were you able to get away on some vacations and
oh how fun
oh
oh how fun
uh-huh
okay
okay the last movie i saw was the five heartbeats and i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it
yeah it's
it's robert townsend movie
i don't know all the actors or anything but it was just it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that
it's still out now it came out i guess about a month or about a month and half ago something like that
it's about a black singing group
it and it was called the dells
and it was kind of like just about their life and their
history and things like that and the way they went from how they went from stardom to non stardom
and that was pretty good i enjoyed i saw dances with wolves have you seen that yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah right now kevin costner i mean he's
starring in everything he's doing the kennedy movie that's coming out
and let me see what else he's doing some other movie i can't i think robin hood that's it the robin hood movie coming out and he's going to be in also
and let me see what else have i seen what have you seen
oh i know what you're talking about
my
it's called reviewing my life or something like that
yeah
i didn't get to see that
yeah that's it okay
um-hum
hm
one of my favorite movies it's not one that i've haven't seen i
it's not a late movie it's
fatal attraction
no i never did i heard it was really good i've never just haven't gone out to see it was that pretty funny
yeah
yeah
somehow just never made it to see that but i need to see it
yeah fatal attraction that i don't know why i like that movie so much i guess it was so much suspense
and i like suspense
yes uh-huh yeah on that order certainly is
and i liked the woman that played in that i forgot what her name is now
anne archer
she's the one she was the wife in fatal attraction
yeah and she played in narrow margin which was a little more recent
and that was kind of another suspense type alfred hitchcock type
thriller that was good
god i guess i haven't seen too many movies lately i need to
yeah
um-hum
somehow i mean i it's hard for me to get to the movies now because it's getting so expensive you know i'd rather rent
yeah
yeah and that's just for a bocket a bucket of popcorn you know yeah
yeah god forbid you should want something to drink with it
but
uh-huh
oh yeah easily
yeah
it's almost more fun really yeah it's almost more fun really to rent movies you know just kind of stay at home maybe
yeah that's true too
yeah
but then you can make your popcorn and you know
be comfortable
so um-hum
well that's about all the movies i've seen recently
yeah
um-hum
it's
no i never did
was that arnold schwarzenegger
yeah
what is it oh kiss before dying
it looks it looks pretty suspenseful
um-hum are you looking in the paper
oh yeah that was great
yes that was that
that might be one of my all time favorites too that was an excellent movie
it was pretty scary because i was visiting a va hospital near to where i live and they were saying that some of the patients there you can't leave by themselves because they'll make a weapon out of anything
you know out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody you know and this guy in silence of the lambs hannibal lector he was he was that kind of person and you they couldn't leave him alone and that's what was so scary about the movie
you know since he was such an awesome character
but they couldn't leave him alone at all
um-hum
oh very good
oh yeah oh yeah
i'm not sure when it'll be hitting video stores but it should be a while yet though
i but i don't like steven seagal things they're just kind
he's had out for justice and there was one right before that with a similar title like
yeah it is i don't like that a lot i don't watch a lot of arnold schwarzenegger or anything like that either
yeah that might be good though that might be good
um-hum
um-hum
no i haven't seen that yet and that's something i really should have seen was that good did you see it
um-hum
yeah a friend of mine saw it and she said it was okay
you know it wasn't anything spectacular
but the
yeah the previews looked so good
that i wanted to see it but i never did
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah
i really need to go see the original one i'm sure it was a good movie i just i probably had a test that day or something i don't know
yeah um-hum
um-hum yeah and that um-hum
um-hum
or something i don't i can't pinpoint it but it doesn't seem like it's as big rage to get to the movie theater as it used to be
um-hum
um-hum yeah exactly
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
right um-hum
um-hum
i don't know what the last thing i've done far as car repairs go is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff i haven't gotten really involved in anything
extensive in car repairs in oh probably a year or so i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an oldsmobile
yeah i know what you mean
yeah
they're fuel injected and so there's
yeah
no there's no way somebody once said i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i can't work on it you know they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that
the guys average guys can't really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs
yeah
absolutely
yeah i used to have
chevy van it was a short van that had the three fifty in it
and basically it was a motor and you didn't have all the other junk around it and you could get to it to work on it
yeah the hardest part about water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it
well that's kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together
oh yeah
yeah
i don't think i'd know where to start with a diesel
well that's true
i think the closest thing i've come to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop when i was in high school and we used to overhaul farm tractors basically
and they were nearly all diesel but as far as cars i've never been involved with them
well yeah and you can get to them
well i
yeah
i'm
i guess you're right the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i don't know exactly why one of the reasons is i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at i don't know if it's still
limited like it was i don't notice it probably because i don't huh
yeah i don't i don't notice but maybe because i'm not looking for it yeah
yeah
but you got the you got the three fifty in the van
yeah that's what i like because they've got plenty of power and
if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be i'm convinced that detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small v eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes
i'm convinced that the small v eight like the mustang's original two eighty nine or some of the chevy two eighty threes
were good little v eight engines that were not gas guzzlers but they had enough power to pull all this weight and the four cylinders just don't have it
yeah
i think those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but
oh yeah
yeah
yeah that's kind of like
the first well my first car was a fifty six mustang and over the years all i had a dodge pickup several years ago and i can't remember the size of the engine it was a three o seven or something like that
but i remember working on those cars you'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things now you open the hood and it's scary like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes
yeah
yeah
well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to
my dad's got a new i guess it's an eighty nine or ninety chrysler something or other it's one those transverse mounted v sixes front wheel drive
and he had never really thought about it and he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off yeah it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall
so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them
right
yeah the antismog pumps
so it's trying to push the weight plus
have all this drain on it from all sorts of
belts and things
but that's one good thing i've got a eight ninety
chevy blazer now and it's got one belt on it a serpentine belt
yeah
i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be better than having i've got an olds tornado that i think's got six belts on the sucker and i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that water pump and
i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where
oh man
you bet everything else's got to come off first well it's a pleasure meeting you
i've got five stickers here from ti so i guess i've done probably i'd say seven or eight of them
yeah i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks so i don't know if it's tapering off or what is i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting answers so it sounds it's taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time so
people or either not or maybe they're burned out or they're through with it anyway let you go thanks for talking bye
do you have young children
oh well then you are familiar with it
okay i have grandchildren and i know one has gone to a well two of them have gone to preschool and i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that why don't you tell me what you have found
okay so
okay so it was in home child care you took them to someone's home
well both times
um-hum
oh uh-huh
i know that in raising my children
i was fortunate i
to have three in day care you know even though one of them's in school full time one of them's you know in kindergarten
that is a lot of money i mean it's so expensive you have to really make a lot of money and i'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life
bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to christmas programs in the middle of the day or something and
you know and i know that one of the day cares and it's a well-known chain
she was not at all happy with it because was there was too many children per person
they were just kind of left to play there was no structure to it and the middle grandson went there as a
like a preschool thing she was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of learning and training and stuff not just there you know so he went like
i think he went
well five mornings a week if i remember correctly and
you know and it was supposed to be a you know starting to learn the colors and learning to associate with children so that when he went to you know a school
and
they had hot lunches and they had classes that you know one class they'd do art they even familiarized the children with computers it was just it was really a very excellent one
he's now five and a half he's in kindergarten this was last year
and so you know it helped him and the first one
he went to a church preschool that was very good the methodist church in richardson the big one and it was a excellent they very good it
oh does he
yeah they the church ones church ones seem to be very well run
oh really
oh i had i just assumed that most churches going by you know experience there that you know that they were good i didn't know that
you know i'm not that familiar i just know that you know first united methodist there at richardson was just a great program
um-hum
yeah it's a pretty good size church too isn't it
um-hum
well are you enjoying staying home
oh uh-huh
um-hum
well isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children and have enthusiasm
my circumstance dealt with kids who were in school
and i thought that was probably more difficult to deal with because finding someone who would fill those small time slots
early in the morning and after school what you were left with were high school girls or boys
and never mind that they had all those noble
qualities like you know you know the same philosophy of raising children that you did you were probably lucky to get anybody because you weren't paying them very much and it was just a short period of time so
it was really kind of someone who would sit and watch tv with them it wasn't the kind of thing that you would get involved in if you had small children and
you had child raising thoughts in mind it was kind of a temporary
babysitting kind of thing have you dealt with that
oh are you pleased with the situation
hm
it wasn't convenient
hm i understand from people who have live in help au pairs and you know just people who live with them that very often you end up involved in their personal problems and
they're taking care of your kids and you're taking care of them do you find that
uh-huh
you said you have a couple of changes do the kids get attached to one person and then it's a problem to wean them off them
how old are the kids
hm i imagine that is a luxury of sorts
uh-huh have you ever discussed with your caretaker how you want your children raised what your philosophies are
you just appreciate the situation oh
well i you know i think this the thing is your situation is what i would call ideal
but it's probably taking both you know you and your wife working to afford this person isn't that so
right when i was home by myself and i had a an eight year old and a six year old
there aren't that many choices and that's the scary part you're just happy to get someone
you know you really are in such desperate need and if your child's sick there's the panic it's like i can't stay home what do i do
and you know you import grandma from the other town to come over it was an emergency you know christmas vacation comes around and then you've got to fill in that block of time
so what type of restaurant do you like
uh-huh
um-hum yeah
uh-huh yeah
yeah now do are indian foods kosher
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
um-hum
oh definitely chinese would uh-huh
um-hum yeah because pastas and the and the different types of sauces and things sure yeah
which is of what no we don't have one uh-huh
you know my wife and you would probably love to go eat together yeah oh definitely well when we go someplace they have to have good french fries
if they don't have good french fries you know if it's one of if it's a place that has other things if it's not that then we go to chinese food you know i order
you know a beef and broccoli or chicken and broccoli or something like that you know chicken and cashews and she orders bean curd
uh-huh yeah she normally picks all of our restaurants though yeah
well we really we really don't do that often i guess recently we did
i get when we got engaged last summer we went for fine dining because we were sort of celebrating and we went to the annapolis area which is
annapolis maryland it it's state capital but it's also on the water so there's a lot of restaurants there it's a
very trendy resort type town but the my wife lived in annapolis for a short time and she really liked this one restaurant it was it's french
but it was really good everything that was very garlicky and their big specials are things like very fancy omelets or very fancy crepes
and then they also have a lot of other french oriented meals and i normally get something that's crepe and very american and then she gets something french yeah but yeah but
yeah definitely yeah but most of the time when we go out
we either go mexican because she just has a need for either some type of mexican chips or mexican pizza or something like that or french fries
you have to you have to have french fries with just about every meal unless you're eating something other you know some other
yes yeah we just had salmon last night for dinner but also the spices here old bay is a spice i don't know if you're even aware of it it's what they used on the
if you ever hear of the maryland steamed crabs
okay well old bay is the spice they put on
the steamed crabs well true male marylander's have old bay on just about everything they put it on their french fries they'll put it in their potato salad they'll
they'll put it with just my wife loves old bay with everything so if we have french fries they have to they have to have old bay on them
right yeah well see i grew up in pittsburgh where heinz ketchup is and my family is big ketchup yeah
um-hum
right
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah we do the same
uh-huh
no you get a couple yeah
it's not a real meal
um-hum
yeah we're the same because i'm in graduate school and we're living off her salary
and my and my part-time work you know it's not our the restaurant our favorite restaurant in the town of salisbury where actually we live you know where my where i'll return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for under fourteen dollars
and that's you know that's the two of us having unlimited french fries
and it may be a mexican pizza sometimes both together along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for vegetables except when she's having french fries
then i'll order like a vegetable soup or something you know but she'll just have the french fries you know
no in fact we're very environmental so we very rarely eat at any of the fast-food restaurants just because of the styrofoam and the plastic waste
and whatever we very rarely will eat at a fast-food restaurant i will i'll eat at one more often because of graduate school and being on the road more
but yeah but she almost refuses you know to do that in fact we're at a point now where if we do a salad bar at the grocery store
we save the same plastic container and we yeah we take it with us back to the store and bring it home yeah and we take yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
well that's a really good idea
yeah
um-hum yeah we we've used the same you know tin bottom with plastic top
probably for the past oh i don't know six months
yeah so we're very you know we try to be very environmental and in fact it's terrible now because i guess we've donated money to a number of organizations and you know we're in school i'm in school and we're
barely surviving here and we get calls now from like world wildlife federation like demanding a hundred dollars
yeah and when you say but we're in we're in graduate school we can't afford that you know they say well how about twenty seven well how about ten you know yeah so
uh-huh yeah we do all we can now
but that it you know i think that also goes along the reason why we pick the restaurants that we go to you know we really -ve we really look at restaurants now there's one other little restaurant in town that we'll go to that is
sandwiches and chips and a pickle you know but you still and that's five fifty
but if you go to a fast-food restaurant you're going to spend four fifty and you're going to produce a lot of styrofoam and a lot of plastic so we you know we'll go there instead of you know just going to a fast-food place
uh-huh
yeah
i do too
um-hum
yeah i agree yeah
no uh-huh
oh
oh
jeez i'll tell i'll tell laura about that
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's because that's really see because a lot of times we'll order a pizza we'll just get a regular cheese pizza or for we just recently got married so my wife
got a heavy duty mixer like a kitchenaid or something like that it's called so she's make she makes dough pizza dough and freezes it
and then takes it out before i get home for the weekend because pizza's probably one of my most favorite food yeah and she'll make that for the weekend and she'll make you know we'll have two pizzas mine will be regular tomatoes and
mozzarella and monterey jack cheese you know sprinkled on it and her's will be you know something
more gourmet but more you know with yeah more with what you like and i she loves broccoli and spinach and i think she i don't think she's ever probably thought of that
uh-huh
yeah so it's just regular it's just tomatoes uh-huh
hello
have no hope for solutions but i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue i have worked with
a little bit with refugees from southeast asia who've come over
you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there and seen you know heard about some of the problems that they've had and i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be because i
in general like a smaller rather than a larger population to the land area and
i'm in california which has a lot of immigration probably more than any where else in the country though i'm not sure if that's the case
uh-huh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
i don't either it's a really delicate moral issue because if you have
well i guess the one thing i do see that is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation
to get them on their feet because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in and you're dooming them to being underclass people
you know you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever and i know that the southeast asians the hmong people that i've done some work with
feel really quite hurt and unsure of themselves when here because they're coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they're coming from the middle ages basically and they're being plunked down in plunked down into america
many of them had been promised by the cia during the war over there that because they cooperated with the cia and they helped the cia out that when they came here the cia would help establish them in america and the cia of course isn't doing that and
and they're incredible victims of crime and part of it is this lack of lack of basic information being dissimilated and i'm not saying it's easy to do and i know there are a few people who are trying but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on
yeah exactly i mean these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what america's like and it's i
i couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i until i met with them and i realized that they some of the information that i just you know don't even realize and know is information
they don't have and i never thought well i guess that is something you need to know you know people getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on available land you know like the median strips on freeways
because no one's using it but then someone comes along and says you can't do that you know why can't they have no idea why not some of them you know the ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now but when they initially come over
yeah because they're farmers these are all farmers coming over and they're being put in the middle of the city
i mean they're nomadic farmers you know they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside
these are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before you know these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war
and they have you know so i do have a lot of sympathy for them and i feel that america could try a little bit harder to help people adjusting to the american way because if they don't you're just going to produce
you know you're going to produce an underclass you know you're going to get a situation that i think a lot like what happened to the blacks being sort of led out of slavery and then
then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then and there was no real up upward movement and not being yeah
well i wasn't helping them i worked with them not to help them but actually for my own purposes i'm a linguist and i was doing a language trying to learn their language a little bit
and i actually i mean helped them in the sense that they received money for working with me but i didn't i didn't i wasn't a social worker or anything like that
i do have friends who have tried to do more social work
you know by explaining to people how the language and what the problems learning english might be and such
because all the models of teaching english are based on teaching english to spanish speakers or to other european language speakers and people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are
oh you are uh-huh well you
yeah it's not they're not withholding information they just don't have that information they haven't the foggiest idea
yes
and spanish is pretty close to english really and spanish is a lot like english
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh i'm sure it would
um-hum
yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure very much and i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the asian groups are having a lot of trouble i mean and part of the problem is that
a lot of chinese and japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth they became a very successful immigrant group
but and but a lot of people coming over from vietnam right now coming from war torn countries are
are not having the same success i think some people have just assumed well why can't you be successful the japanese were or the chinese were or something and it's really much more complicated
yeah the times are different yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah i think it's a wonderful thing to do and there's a lot there's a lot more i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it
more of the volunteer network service because everyone gains from it
would be would might be really useful
um-hum
yes
um-hum
yes i've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country i mean and they're highly educated people but of course if you're educated and you don't speak english no one thinks anything of you
um-hum
yeah i do too
well it's been good talking with you
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i rather enjoy the cosby show my wife and i both like commish
it's either friday night it's either tonight or tomorrow night around here at least
i guess it depends on what channel you're getting you know what system you're getting it through
we always enjoyed it seems to be kind of halfway between
something like all in the family and hill street blues
it's a good show
you tend
yeah
yeah
he tenderhearted fellow
yeah i guess that's what first drew us to him the
but
yeah
yeah
yeah i don't know we
watch commish any chance we get
used to be a big fan of star trek but that's kind of it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against anything
spiritual
but
anyway
yeah i used to be a used to be a real big fan of star trek
pretty much yeah i always enjoyed the show anyway
and star trek's in a the star wars set
the one of the first star wars movie
i think i watched it something like nineteen times
but
no it
we don't do a whole lot of tv watching but that i don't know if you heard him or not they got a twelve year old twelve week old baby
uh-huh
yeah that between that and school it's not between him and school there's not much time left for watching much tv
yeah this one here is our first and we're both full time students so
yeah
what are you hoping for a boy or a girl
that that's the best way you haven't found out yet or anything have you
yeah
that's the best way
i mean it's like finding out somewhere in july what you're gonna get for christmas i mean you know it's not as much fun oh
anyway
yeah
oh i'm about half kid heart anyway
i
well
the new cartoons don't seem to be worth much but the well a couple of the ones disney's doing aren't too bad but
oh yeah
yeah
the worst of the violence in the flintstones was when somebody gave fred a poke in the snoot
but oh shoot i mean blowing up galaxies and putting a curse on the whole planet or you know or on all the you know everything of this species you know just all kinds of crud
yeah everything's mutations and killing and
gone are the days of those things they use what was it i turner broadcasting network used to
used to do the saturday morning and sunday morning cartoons the old cartoons they used to put between the first and second feazure feature at the theatre
those old little ten minute jobs where the real ballooned looking art work you know and
it's a two story house it it's a first home and it looks like it's going to be the last i think we're going to demolish it
we've got two children and it's
they have scraped the plaster off the walls you know with riding their little toys through it and stuff
you know
put dents in the tiles just multitude of them i mean even places it's past the dent stage we're talking some of it's been peeled away you know i don't know what they
i mean it sounds like it's just the pits but it's not all that bad i guess but you know they're just real hard on it
definitely i can see why people wait until they get like in high school or maybe junior high and then they get another one
i know there's a lot of them
yeah
because they're always
because they're always ruining something
how old is your child
well
some appliances breaking or something
and you said you were in colorado springs
are there a lot of trailers around there
and is that what you're in
well then that's why you're doing this then isn't it
okay well
i'm not in ti
i had a friend that had a roommate that worked for ti and she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off
and passed it on to people that were interested
i know i've been talking to people in ohio and virginia
and i think california
yeah it is
how does she get to work
uh-huh
i had a room
and i wish we could down here
well sometimes but i tell you i'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work but if i did it it'd take me about an hour and fifteen minutes
i would have to get on one and drive or walk to a you know there's one terminal close to us and then they'd drive me to the main terminal here then i'd have to go to downtown dallas and then walk over a couple of blocks and get on another bus to go to my school
so that's too much
yeah but there sure are a lot of people that work down there
definitely and i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial
and i mean all these people were standing up that was you know during the workday all along the streets you know just
all around these vacant buildings there's a lot of vacant buildings
and they're just being demolished
and they stink and beer and wine bottles all over the place huh-uh
um-hum
you know i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand
it's gotten big
i think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty something like that
and i didn't realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from dallas
you know i know now
but i didn't i'm from kilgore texas it's in east
oh where are you from
are you
so why'd you move up to colorado
well it's real pretty up there i have a friend in denver
what do you
what
they're not owning homes period
uh-huh
it wasn't such a bad idea
so have you got land
i did that one year i lived with two other girls and we all taught
it was a two bedroom so we took turns
you know
having sharing the bedroom
i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom
and then we had two baths it was just one the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in
that was in the seventies
uh-huh
uh-huh
so have
have you got it underpinned
are you required to by law
we were down here
yeah
well i bet it's not bad
okay
but how much is yours when we bought ours were paying three hundred and twenty nine dollars
for how many years
oh so it was still a lot cheaper
so it was still a lot cheaper than what we did because ours is thirty years
and we bought one of the cheapest houses you know a tract house
which probably didn't make much difference
in the price
so if the economy gets better are you going to get another one
another house
no
but you wouldn't take that mobile home right
you would
it'd be cheaper to move that than buy another one
ti would pay move you
so how many years you been up there
do you snow ski
it's real pretty i went rock climbing one time
yeah my opinion
is not quite well enough formulated for real debate but above all i really believe
that first of all people are innocent until proven guilty and secondly that in some sense there's a sort of sanctity of the body issue in that i don't
really believe that other people would have the right for someone to under go a blood test without their explicit consent
so i think that pretty much clearly leads me to my conviction that i do not believe that spot drug tests or required drug tests should be should be
you know mandated however they could be done with the person's consent
right
and in the case of driving it's not a it's a privilege to drive
and there's certain things that go along with it but even then they don't force you to take any kind of test if you simply don't take the test then you just you know
yeah
right in that case because it clearly endangers someone in that case
um-hum
ah wow
well as far as i'm not sure you sort of seem to be kind of saying that you have the right to pursue any kind of substance that you'd like except for in certain
circumstances like driving is that what you're trying to say
right
well not having alcohol prohibition and tobacco prohibition i think those are more historical artifact of
the link between the business and the government though because there
yeah
well i'm i guess we should get back to the drug testing issue
yeah well i'm trying to think of more coherent thought it's kind of difficult to have a debate
well what are your hobbies
well that sounds interesting what kinds of sweat shirts and t-shirts do you make
okay
is it silk screening or
oh i see
well how's it going
well that sounds great
well somebody has to do it
give you a little christmas money anyway
well i kind of have hobby fads i guess when i was growing up i was into coin collecting and that dropped off about the time i hit puberty i guess and then
my hobbies in high school went just to the sports
now my latest one's is classic cars i've
i had a sixty six mustang that i was rebuilding but i almost had it done and i went on went ahead and sold it
but it was fun i really enjoyed it
oh you just
no you just kind of all i did was i bought the car and then
you know you can i
was just in a supermarket and i seen a magazine for
you know basically it was called mustang magazine and so i bought it and they had
some names some companies that sold mustang parts and i just started ordering some parts and you know basically you know i what i did was
i redid the whole interior i didn't do too much to the engine because the engine was pretty good but the whole interior and then part of the exterior just kind of do it
well we lived we lived in south dakota and i bought it up there -fore i moved down here
so it was it was kind of rusted out there isn't too much rust on any vehicles down here
well gee i guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies that about covers mine and t-shirt making about covers yours
in new mexico
okay
yeah that is that's interesting how many music boxes do you have
do they all play different songs or do some of them play the same song
well that's neat what's the most expensive one you bought
oh really
well that that's interesting it used to be teaspoons was the thing
yeah that's interesting music boxes
well
well how was europe
was that in high school or was that a college thing
i bet
right
that's where a camcorder would come in handy
well that sounds real neat
so you haven't been back to europe since though huh
there you go
well does you husband what does he think of your t-shirt and
does he help out much or
well pat what do you wear to work
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah my schedule yeah my schedule's pretty similar i teach so on the days i teach i teach a couple days a week so whenever i teach i try and wear a tie
but that's i wear normally just wear like
khaki pants and a shirt and tie i never wear a sport coat that's ridiculous but then most of the time you know then i just have to i can wear jeans or
or just casual clothes i think they i think they frown on shorts and sneakers but i think i could probably get away with jeans and sneakers
yeah i could well if i don't have to see students
and i'm just in my lab and no one sees me then i'm probably okay
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
right um-hum
yeah well that makes sense
uh-huh
yeah as long as you're clean and yeah that makes a lot of sense
uh-huh yeah that's true
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah that would that would
um-hum
yeah and you don't have to worry about fashion and stuff too you know buying nicer clothes and things yeah hey that makes a lot of sense
um-hum yeah your
um-hum that's right where the uniform as a waitress now your uniform really it might be a little expensive when you first buy it but you know that's it doesn't it's made of polyester so it doesn't stain like cotton or wool would you know
um-hum
yeah um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah well that makes sense yeah that makes a lot of sense
um-hum
uh-huh yeah
um-hum
that's probably the people that probably the people that are prone towards getting dirty
yeah with the type of job that you have you might be getting dirty either manual label labor where you'll perspire heavily or where you'll come in contact with oil and things
right um-hum
yeah
yeah that's what yeah i find too if you're a programmer do you get cold does your how's your air conditioning work
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
oh see yeah because my office is really heavily air conditioned because i guess they keep the air conditioning on all the time where they don't in a lot of the other offices because of the computers and
right um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah see sometimes my air conditioning gets really cold i think it's probably because my office is one of the only ones air conditioned in a
a large area you know probably that's why i get because sometimes boy i'll get i'll freeze it's so cold in there especially when it's ninety degrees outside
right yeah and blows on my legs man one time i left i thought i was going to i thought i was going to freeze the one day i wore shorts to the office because i was just going to be in my lab
and i wanted to be comfortable because i thought the air conditioning would be all turned off you know and jeez if it wasn't the air conditioner wasn't blowing it wasn't fifty five degrees yeah
that's true a lot of those nice looking legs yeah
we recently we decided we'd buy a sewing machine because that would be a good investment you know and we could make clothes and save money so she's made me shorts
well of course you know she makes shorts and she says here i made you shorts and they're a nice material nice checkered plaid material here but
color you know but i was just crossing through to get my mail and stuff
uh-huh
yeah
just when they go to play golf they wear those funny clothes hat's true
um-hum
um-hum yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah but they have that dress code i you know i also know eds
eds i have some friends that interviewed with eds and you know they interviewed while they were in college so they didn't really have a suit with them and the woman said to them well your second interview would be
you know which is popular with the kids and she says oh and you know i wouldn't put the gel in my hair you know in other words you're to borrow a you know a two or three piece suit
with no gel in your hair you know and that would she made it pretty clear during the you know the first interview how they were supposed to dress for the second interview you know
so i thought that was really funny too you know
um-hum
um-hum
i don't think my hair has probably changed in
ten years
um-hum
he he's into what
oh really
uh-huh
well you know my dad was the same way i thought it was really funny back in the nineteen seventies my brother came home with cowboy boots on while was growing up in pittsburgh and my dad called my brother tex for about the next four weeks
yeah i thought it was just so funny you know my dad we're not in texas
and she and we're all short the whole family's short so she said well sam if he wears cowboys that gives him another inch and it just may be
i guess i've always kind of liked golf i worked on a golf course at one time and that's how i picked up golf
and
i don't know it's just a kind of a challenging game
um-hum
i haven't gotten the chance lately though to play i'm trying to get back into it
so i got to start all over again it's not like riding a bicycle you do tend to forget
oh yeah
okay
yeah i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago it's probably up there to twenty now if i was ever to start again
yeah
i got to try and get out there i
i know with our long winters i enjoy watching it i don't know if it's just because i like the game or i just like to see the warm weather
um-hum
yeah that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every spring to
to get back out
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah you always work on trying to improve each day and
yeah i know what you mean i when i used to golf out there i'd putt well but i wouldn't chip well one of the two
or something would go wrong but
i always managed to get near par anyway
oh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
do you have long waits to get on the course
yeah
yeah okay yeah
i just moved into this small community so i'm
gonna try and get in one of their golf courses here
i'm hoping it won't be i was from the
twin cities area
yeah
are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather
yeah
well i wish that's all we had
oh
yeah
oh i see well at least it that doesn't get in the way of golfing so
that
now that's what they do here sometimes you hear about it where they'll take the orange ball out there but
if you got
well actually i don't think they're out of line devil's advocate possibly but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether or not you agree with that law
you're still circumventing it you are legal in your circumvention of that law
bryn mawr stereo dealer but
then why not pay the sales tax to pennsylvania corporations have to why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax
yes
i i'll agree it it's not your responsibility but
is it also legal
for you to do that from what i understand from various net readings it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state
tax schemes in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get with some with something like that do your arguments still apply
which is exactly what businesses do at the present
and i
i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having to pay sales tax on it
that's my understanding of the way the way it works usually the person ordering it doesn't pay but the accounting department will suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay
and there are some substantial nasty penalties if you if businesses try to avoid that
a as if
no businesses if
purchasing things mail order if i if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six motherboards from say utah
i might buy the motherboards from utah but then still have to pay some pennsylvania sales tax my accounting department will at the end of the month
yeah
is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just to do just that in order in order to gain the revenue that's being lost and i don't know if i agree with that but it
a variety of boats at our disposal i worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats
couple of guys restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and
got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and
we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice
chambers that keep it afloat or keep it upright again this one you had to work with you get out of the water again and get it upright and sailing was kind of nice to
learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind as it were attacking back and forth and
more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing in and soon as the front came over
it's a nice hobby to have and nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change i guess
what are your memories of boating or current
right
it's true
yeah i remember learning how to ski oh i guess i was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres
turtles in it and i got all ready to go and i was down in the water and set to go and a and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back it didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where i let go
and the boat went off without me and i reached back there and
pushed him away and got out of the water a while and it didn't even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and
so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and i'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier and i had let go before then and
before they took off this time and swatted him away so i moved over a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and managed to get up didn't go very far but i got up
and it was a nice long skiing career but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me i've
done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and i
i know how
you can get injured doing much more than that and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess
managed to get a hold on that craft yet but
yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of
work your way up to it and turn around real quick you know grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around but i don't know maybe someday i'll
yeah from everywhere too not just from mexico you know just everywhere
yeah i
all they you know thinking that they're going to have money and jobs and success and everything and then there is no jobs and they end up homeless and not knowing anybody and no money and it's terrible
yes
really and true how do you figure
did you really
well
and then they're treated rotten the actual native americans the indians well they've got they've got the worst deal around
i've never
i've never been out there
uh-huh
yeah
yeah oh and still are
you know don't have good jobs and living on reservations alcoholics and oh it's terrible it makes me really ill but i've never even been to colorado
yeah
that's true that's true well did you start with ti out here and then go to
and oh okay and then went to colorado
so
so do you see a lot of well let's see what's in colorado do you see a lot of immigrants of any kind like we do here
uh-huh
oh okay yeah
yeah
yeah but then you know too on a it's of course what i think about when we talk about immigrants i know they're coming from everywhere but i think a lot about
coming from mexico because i guess i'm so close to that and if they close the well the borders are closed basically i mean they're but we get all these people that come in illegally and stay
well no that's true it's not but it is i mean they're coming i mean we've got
they're supposed to have all these laws passed where people aren't supposed to hire illegal aliens and all this and whether that's working or not i don't know because i don't hear anymore about it
yeah
the whole kitchen crew and the busboys and everything were all illegals in most of the restaurants i worked in as a waitress you know it whether that came to a halt i don't know
in california i know it is
is it too in texas also i didn't know
because it's pretty scary when you own a home and you know
you could
you could not
huh-uh
oh it's horrible isn't it
um-hum see and they put their children to work and everything don't they
no
and no one and see americans wouldn't do it wouldn't they wouldn't live like that
they wouldn't do it
you couldn't get the street people i was just going to say you couldn't get these homeless people probably to do that
i see them on corners with signs saying i'll work for a meal but i'll bet you if you stopped and you offered them a meal if they'd come and do your yard they'd get out of it some way they just really
that's right
that's right
i know it
oh yes how well i know i was laid off last year but i was i was lucky because i was one of the first groups to go
well in division one and i got went right to you know they have the job centers for us and everything and i just
oh boy i worked hard through i went through the j o b's and found this and was versatile enough had a little bit of office experience and they hired me and i was just real thankful and now there's nothing
for all the people who are getting laid off now there's just nothing
you know i know colorado springs has been hit also
i'm in i'm in payroll division nine yeah corporate payroll so
it didn't for a while there were a lot of rumors flying and i still hold a red badge and it's still i'm still under five years so if they had a layoff in division nine
oh i guess this is a topic near and dear to my heart since i am a am a healthy eater
especially like good prime rib so if it's nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that and i live here in rome new york and there are a lot of good restaurants around here
uh-huh
uh-huh
really
well no i i'm in upstate new york and it's actually very inexpensive i there's a there's a place half a mile from me here that
has fantastic prime rib for eleven dollars a whole meal you know a potato and salad and soup and the whole nine yards so it
right
uh-huh sure
uh-huh
no i'm not into the don't do the raw fish like that but i do like a seafood bar like a raw bar like oysters and things like that
that they i go on i'm an officer in the air force and travel quite a bit on business so i find myself down in melbourne florida about once a month once every two months or so and
and maryland's great you get the crabs it's like i can't go anywhere where i where i don't enjoy myself so
that's true
yeah well yeah it's really strange that seafood is so expensive because when you in reality
we've managed to figure out how to get at just about everything else but not seafood
what
yeah i like yeah i'd make a wicked chili and around here the big spicy thing is like buffalo wings
right
sure
yeah
uh-huh
my generally my scalp will start i can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot it's like weirdest sensation almost like a tingling but
i don't know but yeah well there isn't too much in the way of restaurants that i don't like things that are kind of oddball like thai cuisine i never been
well but that stuff is goes one notch beyond my tolerances so
well i find that lately that so many people are working you know they're working waitressing jobs or waiter
okay i do a fair amount of cooking
and i love having guests to dinner
i probably do that about once a month
and
i usually prepare something depending upon the guests you know if i like to prepare chicken that seems to please everybody pasta or a casserole how about you
um-hum well that's about the way i prepare most fish
i made scallops the other night that was unusual and
basically i found a recipe to make it in the microwave
and you sprinkled the you swished around a little melted butter and do
oh i do not know microwaved them for about
nine minutes no four and a half five minutes and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top very simple but very nice
so if you are looking for a fish recipe that was good
sesame seeds and bread crumbs
and my husband liked it
and no unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive
fish items
but you know i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store
one of the things i love to do eat out how about you
do you have any particular places you like going
uh-huh
yes i've been there
and i kind of kind of like the black eyed pea but i don't think it's a chain
oh
oh
yeah
yeah i don't feel like they are very healthy and i always feel like the home cooking places are the healthiest meals even though i tend to have chicken fried steak when i go to them
oh how was it
um-hum
yeah i tend to i get teased by my family a lot because i like experimenting on
on food and sometimes i go for fairly exotic
things and my father teases me about gourmet cooking
last time we had some friends over for dinner i tried the dessert that sounded wonderful in the recipe and it was just total bust
i was sorry i didn't have some ice cream to fall back on
oh my that's ambitious
hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
huh
see i am not that's interesting one of the things i don't make is dessert
experiment for this company we had about three weeks ago it was just a total fiasco
everything else was fine but that was a fiasco
yeah
yeah and i also don't have much of a sweet tooth so i can live without live without desserts for the most part
yeah
do you cook for yourself or do you cook for others
yeah
well when i was single i used to i think my favorite meal was a
a baked potato
and
oh yeah
oh yeah and i mean i never put anything other than a little butter on it if i had or if i had a little cheddar cheese sometimes i would grate that up
and amazingly satisfying
yeah i didn't say it was nourishing but it was satisfying
and
yeah
yeah that but you know i never really enjoyed cooking for myself so i ate very simply and i was
that's why i think that's one reason i like having people over because i could try things i mean i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that because cooking is a little bit like being in a chemistry lab
and
sometimes it blows up anyway
i once had a an old boy friend over to dinner when i was just briefly staying with my parents
and
i had this wonderful recipe and you were supposed to make a toffee like substance
for a pie by boiling evaporated milk
three hours and it does turn to toffee inside the can
and the only problem was when i opened the can
it just flew all over the place it was on the ceiling and on the walls and on me and the boyfriend
thought that was he was supposed to be there at six o'clock not seven o'clock so just at the time all this happened the door bell rang and there he was
i really don't remember that was about ten years ago i just remember
how embarrassing it was and i have made i have made it since i've i and several times before and i never had that problem just that one time
and he was a gourmet cook he was kind of person who
but i do enjoy cooking so i was awfully glad i was given this
so you keep a budget
that's your budget eh
yep
yeah
wife and i
a lot tighter and we've actually worked out a very extensive year long budget
so we know exactly what we're gonna spend when and when we're gonna have money and we've worked out a cash flow
we just bought a house which is another reason why we're really keeping track of the pennies and that stuff
this detailed budget and in some ways it's really kind of nice because there's not much of a worry or not much a discussion or any
real conflict over whether we should do this or that or we always have a there's a sense of confidence a little bit because we both know that we're going to have money to do what we said we're going to do
yeah we as my brother told me when he he's in accounting and he suggested we do this as we were
making these big financial steps and all this stuff and he said well you just do this and you fight once and that's it once a year and that's it because you've worked out the budget and what you're going to spend
ah
doesn't sounds like you guys have gotten something worked out that's gonna work just fine
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yes
yeah what we've done see we've only been married three years and i
my wife isn't real good with checkbooks and math and all that stuff and so what i did is i just gave it all to her and i said you have to do it everything
and then i come in and help her
and
oh i agree with you
it's amazing will rogers who was in the twenties and thirties if you hear the guy that gimmicks him and uses his same material it is pertinent today as it was then
yeah
um-hum
attorneys yeah did you catch that the defensive driving course you can take to get out of a ticket was recently changed from two years to once every twelve months
it was also noted in some journal that the percentage of ownership of the driving schools by legislatures has greatly increased
yes they're not down there to live off the salary of what they're paid
yes
um-hum
um-hum
and won't get reelected
i agree with you a hundred percent
oh i think all the
all the way down to dog catchers of the city yes sir limited turn
two
um-hum
you seen the benefits that
yeah
and legislatures in warshin get after they've been there a few terms is unbelievable they get their salary for life health benefits for life
oh have you ever noticed when
what
right
they tried that in washington or was it or oregon
but speaker of the house was from there
and if approved it he would not have been eligible to continue representing and being speaker
and so the voters kicked it said no we since we're the one with the with the gun right now we're not gonna vote out having the gun having the power
so when i don't lbj's a perfect example of how somebody can be broke and get into politics and come out rich as yeah
i don't think one of the question was could they legislate laws to keep politicians honest my opinion no because they won't pass laws against themselves
um-hum
let them
um-hum
well what kind of pets do you have
are you're married
and newly married
oh
sounds like us
only we started off ours with we had we had pets before we had kids that's why i thought when you were saying you know we're going to have one in two months or something
hm
yeah
yes
that's easier
are you going to get a dog
that's what that's what we have is two dogs
big dogs
and we got one right after we got married we both decided we needed a dog we went to the pound and we got this mutt
and he's been it was alright before we had our kids it was he's just he's a real hyper dog he barks and jumps a lot
so we had him for a year and then my husband decided after we had him a year that he'd wanted for his entire life to have a siberian husky
you know this was your dream of your life to have a siberian husky
so we got the other one
for him and to keep the first one company when we were at work all day
so we have the old the older dog's a male and he's
he weighs about forty pounds and then pepper is a year younger and she weighs
about seventy pounds
so we have two massive dogs
go through lots of dog food
absolutely
i never wanted my husband wanted indoor dogs because he'd grown up with them but i can't stand it indoors
i don't they shed and you know the mud and
oh yeah
goodness
oh my goodness
sure
they're going to run you down
goodness and all of them were in the house
hm
i see
yeah
hm
okay
oh when i was growing up my folks we had fox terriers which are little bitty
they weigh about ten pounds
and so we had we had one for a long time
she had four or five litters she always had to look we always kept them in the house when they had the when she when the babies were little
and the rest of the time they were outside they had a big we had a big kind of a play house and part of that was their dog house it was kind of cordoned off
so they had a place to stay out there and then they had the yard and they had a little run that they kept them in when we were trying to do stuff in the back yard and didn't want them out
but we had the same kind of situation at one point in time we had the mother the one of her last
her next to last litter we kept we had one the one we never could get rid of
he was a real dumb dog nobody wanted him the puppy was just one of these dogs just as dumb as a stick
and we have him
and then our female she had another litter we didn't think she was we thought she was too old to get pregnant again
turned out she wasn't
and she had her litter i guess her last litter had like
four and two of them survived and then she didn't make it
two days after the they were born she had a she died
she had some kind of an infection from it all she was just too old
we had to feed the puppies we had to get up night and day with those just like with a baby
and bottle feed them
and we just
oh
weren't they messy too well did she did the mother survive
so you could still feed it but she kept them clean
oh she didn't she didn't do something
oh no
yuck
oh goodness
what's a mess
that was like oh boy they are so messy when they're little too
we were giving them a bath about every other boy we were giving them a bath at least once a day but they were so horrible
because they would roll and everything and oh
yeah
oh i guess i had fish for a while when i was a kid too i had a fish tank
and i had a few until
well it wasn't really an aquarium it was an old you know how you used to have these
this was a box and it was originally it was it was made like an aquarium i guess except it was smaller but it was its original use was to put in the refrigerator on the shelf had a little spigot at one end
we outgrew the need for that
it worked except the fish could swim
flip out of the thing but
yeah
those have been i mean and our dogs now our dogs with our kids i have two little kids three and a half and one and a half
so we built the dog run down the length of our back yard
because the kids were i mean we couldn't even let our older son until he was about two i guess he was two when we built the dog run we couldn't let him go out in the back yard
because it was we have a deck with a rail and he could go on that but the dogs were so big and he was so little
you know they just even walking by him they'd knock him down and the whole the whole back yard had poop in it all the time
it was a mess for the little one so
now we have a back yard and a dog run
oh that'll be nice
yeah back and forth
three and a half
yeah
or probably he or she is old enough to where they won't tease it too you know poke on it too much
yeah
because that's hard ours our kids have gotten
over it with the dogs behind it they have the run it's kind of like a wire run
so they go the first thing they do is they go out there and play with them but boy the little one still he just wants to poke
my older one our older son's pretty good about it he'll pet the dog you know
and he's three and a half like you're saying and he he's pretty good with them and with other people's dogs and cats that he runs into
but boy the little one still just wants to poke and
and see if the dog will back off you know and
yeah i think it is too it's gonna get better
yeah
yeah
i think if we didn't have pets if we didn't already have our dog and cat now we wouldn't get them because the kids are so little
i think when they're really little like the eighteen month old it's not fair to the animal
if they're out very much
yeah
that's
yeah and not get mad at the kid that's the other thing too that
i always felt pepper the siberian husky is really sweet she can i think the kids could walk up and
she's real good natured about it
yeah
well i think that's about all my pet stories right now so
okay well it's been nice talking to you
okay bye-bye
uh-huh was this spiegel by any chance
but well and did you have any problem obviously had no problem with returning it
oh well
um-hum
did
did you return it because it was defective or because you just didn't like it
huh
well i know what you mean because a couple years ago i remember i was in one of the nicer department stores and looking at it was one of the designer t-shirts or some sort of thing like that and the thing
it was very expensive you know as they always are and it was a piece of junk you know stitching was terrible i think that they were trying to just you know play on a name
um-hum
no we don't i've been to one of the nordstroms in new york
nice store
do you really
do you have lord and taylor there
we're originally from saint louis and we came down to dallas and they have lord and taylors here and i look at a lot of their house brands and i am very impressed with the quality of some of the house brands in some of the stores
does nordstroms carry their own house brand
um-hum
um-hum
do you shop by mail quite a bit
it's not as
um-hum
that's the only problem that i see because my sister gets tons of catalogs and passes them on to me and i look at things and they have some gorgeous clothes but the problem is that
you can't always go by sizes you know you'll go to a department store and try on three different sizes in three different manufacturers and they all fit you know differently but that's the main thing is that i can't tell
whether the thing is going to fit or not
and so i tend not to mail order
but
well personally i always try on before i buy anyway i just it amazes me when i talk to people that they buy like they buy a bunch of clothes and they don't try anything on they take them home
oh okay well that's a different story right
i hear about that too and that just appalls me i mean that's stealing really
is probably the ross perot candidacy i think that has some interesting effects to it at this point with the
level of
outrage that the public seems to have the voting public seems to have with the existing candidates out there and i think that
that is certainly something that we haven't seen to this level before
big political issues
um-hum
yeah
yeah
it and it usually you know it's a big deal until election day comes around and then it you know it fizzles out and we end up with the same people
and you have to wonder whether is this going to be something that is really going to result in
well the media keeps saying that he's supposed to drain it away from the democrats but i know that there's a lot of democrats that don't like bill clinton
i'm one of them i'm not happy with bill clinton at all but
i you know i'm more concerned about democrats saying they're unhappy with bill clinton and then they go and vote for ross perot and then we basically split any protest vote
against bush more or less in half you know i mean you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me that's not a going to be a wonderful feeling
but
i think it'll be interesting to see whether it turns out he gets more than twenty percent of the vote if that i
yeah but i you know it'll be interesting i don't i agree that i don't think that
um-hum
it's legal down here
i know they've done a few most of the time they'll get real close and then
they'll pardon him or
it hardly ever gets to that point i don't think they've done one
in a long time but i know it's legal and i know one just about happened recently but it never went through
so they try but you know very few actually go
um-hum
yeah
yeah there's always those loopholes
ooh
was that was that on purpose or was that a snafu
uh-huh
yeah
that was his dirt huh
yeah
well i can i can vouch for the fact that the appeals will go through and go through and go through
and yeah it drags on for about forever you know i guess i'm about your opinion of it i have nothing against it philosophically
in terms of if you're absolutely sure i mean i would feel that you better make sure it's one of those cases that has virtually no possibility of
you know you pretty i mean supposedly you get through the courts you're not supposed to have any reasonable doubts anyway but i guess it would have to be one of those extremes in the first place but there's enough of them
but i i've also heard that these things cost so much in the end that
that it really doesn't save you any money if it's a money thing and as a deterrent thing i don't really think personally i don't feel that capital punishment as a deterrent is a is a big deal i don't think that really works that much
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
it's
yeah
oh down here it's not all peaceful either though i don't if you've been following any of this stuff course we had the big snafu right now with the mets thing but there have been a lot of
course i don't think they've they that then actually down here there's more publicity going on police screw ups and
beatings and everything than actual murders and the with the gainesville picking up people seemingly
well you know you last night i was listening to the ten o'clock news
and for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings the number of drug deals that were going on and crime and it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah i did too i remember i used to work at kentucky fried chicken and i just couldn't believe you know that now i would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one
and because of the crime that they would just kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there in their cash drawer
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah oh i understand what your talking about
so yeah i have you know a real problem even though i live further out in the suburbs the crime follows you anywhere it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this
so but i just think about all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum yeah so i don't know you know it's asking about what kind of steps we can take
you know just as citizens to try and protect ourselves i know i have you know a home security system plus i have the special lights on the outside and i have
yeah that
yeah by themselves if you if there's some kind of movement then they'll automatically come on but i mean it's just that i constantly think about keeping us safe and protected verses
two
one of each um-hum yeah
no they're teenagers now
yeah
oh wow yes that's a problem yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
it's different yeah living down here now the nice thing i feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this
i feel like that there's going to be less crime or your neighbors going to be watching out for you because it's practically it's in their backyard too
um-hum
oh goodness
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my goodness
um-hum
uh-huh
oh goodness
someone did yeah
um-hum yeah i know that it's a real problem it doesn't matter really where you are anymore it's more of a matter of what you the steps that you do to keep yourself safe
and so that's what i try and do
um-hum
really uh-huh
yeah you know i was going home the other day and i saw a guy who looked like he was breaking into a window and i thought gee whiz you know i don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's the person who lives there
you know and i was thinking well i need to call the police when i get back home and because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live and i thought no you know
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
in half that time wow and that's so scary so scary you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe and somebody could break in and well i have a dog that's the one thing that i like is
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
oh yeah oh yeah so that's we a little dog now but he is just as vicious as if you know if you if somebody and loud
you know and i thought that you know we'd have to have a big dog but we don't need a big dog we got this little bitty dog that part dachshunds and part cocker spaniel and he he's very protective
yeah very protective
um-hum
that's right
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum oh wow gosh well it was nice talking to you
okay
okay bye-bye
okay
bryan you've said you have one child right now have you had any problems with day with child care services
um-hum
did you utilize that full-time while you were working
um-hum
um-hum
what type of costs were you facing excessive or
um-hum
um-hum
yeah we're at a stage in our life where we don't have any kids
yeah but we're approaching that point where we're going to have make a decision as far as
does my wife continue to work or do i continue to work to
make ends meet and do you put child in day care along that lines and the reality is that we'll probably have to have a child in day care
and been thinking about how much that's going to cost it's
rather frightening figure you really cuts into your income
one of the things we have at our my company is day care reimbursement program we actually put money away into a tax free
program
and they it's you're reimbursed out of that out of that funds provided it's used specifically and only for day care
it's probably one of the few programs that i've seen that accomplished that
it helps out a little bit
yeah
but unfortunately i'm not you know able to tap into that until we have kids so that's down the road a little bit
but i do have some brothers and sisters who are
struggling as it is right now to make ends meet
and they're also very uncomfortable with the idea of day cares
but they're forced into that situation right now
what's
you know most people i know who have had to make that decision
the spouse usually the mother in situations that i can think of have been in tears they've dreaded the moment
for throughout most of the pregnancy knowing that they'd have to eventually go back to work
and when the time actually came to send your child to day care
it was
basically a very traumatic moment
as she dreads that date too i imagine
but unfortunately it is a reality you just can't get by without
well very few people can get by without two incomes
least especially in the early stages of a career
um-hum
do you find any that there would be any benefits to a day care such as exposure to unlimited basis
exposure to other kids
developing social interaction
so
i guess i guess i'd have to go with i i'd be for it
kind of a delicate subject i guess but i would i would probably go for going ahead and doing it you know if it's got to be done for everyone
right
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
and then i kind of hear it goes into like this is just something i've heard that it kind of goes into like just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold that it kind of affects that too
oh i didn't know that
yeah see things like that so
yeah
right uh-huh
see that's
yeah that's where i kind of get into cause it's just kind of gets into your personal life you know and
it's like what's kind of next
the what
huh
oh
yeah
right
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
we haven't either
i just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way
yeah
right
right
yeah
lee
okay
oh wow so it's getting warmer up there then huh
it's cooling off down here it's going to get down to probably around sixty tonight so
yeah just as beautiful during the day though
i work down here for pratt whitney
and i heard about this over the technet
on the on the computer there at work we get electronic mail all the time
not news groups no not really i'm an engineer there
okay
yeah and what do you do
oh okay
okay well it's getting kind of late so you want to get started here we're going to talk about taxes i guess
you probably talk all night about this okay
okay then you want to go ahead and start or do you want me to go ahead and start when we
okay i'll let you go ahead and start and then i'll press the one now are you ready here we go
um-hum
yeah
right well the thing that makes me angry about paying taxes i don't mind paying it for services you know for defense
the country and for services like roads and for sewage and for basic water and stuff but when we got to pay for some of these people that are on welfare and stuff that's when i get i get pretty mad
i mean i think a lot of that is wasted
yeah right i
yeah
yes
yeah that's true i'm not sure what to do about it though you know this is a big election this year and everything we all these guys running for president and
i
um-hum
yeah
what's that
no i don't i don't think we are
i don't agree with that
oh you mean by us paying taxes is a poor step we are doing that indirect oh yes i agree i think that's the way the well yes i do agree with that
when they can just sit around their porches all day and still get a check at the end of the week i think that's pretty pitiful especially when they're able bodied people
yeah well the you know the thing is we get these people in there that are like career politicians and they're grieved by so many people
and they're
okay lucille i'm ron moore
and our okay our topic was did you hear our topic all right basketball i guess i'm probably a lot like you i'm a dallas maverick fan
well -fortunately i don't expect a great deal out of them they just have too many problems too many ailments too many hurt bones and maybe too much age at this point
you know when roy tarpley just now he messed up on them it just hurt them so bad i feel like everyone else i feel sorry for donald carter and the owners of the team and the management of team and everyone else it just seems like
they were just getting themselves in a position where they could be a final a final team playing for all of it national championship or the world championship and something like this happens
yeah i think at this time we're just in a rebuilding type of phase you know i think
that probably would be evident with the more and more the more and more young guys they draft
oh gosh i'm so much of a magerick maverick fan i don't know probably the boston celtics i've just always liked the boston celtics they have a
they have a similar situation now that a lot of old guys on the team and but they're still playing good ball but i'm a i've always been a boston celtic fan too but
you know i've lived in texas since seventy four so being a transplanted texan in the dallas area i have to stick with those dallas mavericks
yes we do you know
yes i go to a few games i haven't been to many i'm not a season ticket holder or anything i was a season ticket holder of the cowboys for years and
oh you bet
i don't know if i'm afraid to say that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good but and that can really help the team but they do that they trade the nucleus of their power right now
well you know i feel like the best they can hope for this year is probably ah an opportunity to make the play-offs i like their coach i really like richie a lot
and i just i think he deserves a good break he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club and i think donald carter the owner i think with all he's invested he deserves a
a healthy team for one year and a good break also this thing with roy tarpley it just upset everyone i think fans owners management everyone
hate to put it that way i just would not believe him anymore
there's an old saying you can you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink so and i think tarpley's just a sad case but to be making ah a million dollars a year that's pretty sad
oh i think you're right everything just been put out of perspective now you know you take a young kid roy tarpley's age i'd say he was twenty one when he came into the league and now he's probably an old age of twenty five or six
and making all that money well that's quite a that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they need at that point in their life i think
so
so i think you know it's created by
so how do you feel about it
yeah i myself almost am in favor of it
i work at honeywell and i went through a pretty i don't know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i was brought on
i think that's pretty standard at least at honeywell it is i think it's important to insure the quality and
and
i don't know almost the goodness of character you know and that kind of thing where do you work
oh okay oh okay
hm
oh great
right
um-hum
yeah
yeah and that definitely happens you know i mean those the drug tests assure they're accurate but there's always that margin of error
and that's something to be aware of
you know i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for honeywell and
you know i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something
i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for
i don't know what program are you in over at carnegie mellon
oh okay great
but
they even for interns they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so
right
they essentially no i sure don't they essentially
they essentially made me the offer and then and then
did the drug testing thing after that
so it was one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests and then they essentially give you the offer
and then at that point they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
so there's some noise on this end i'm actually in a mall calling so
but so
yeah that's a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave if you fail i believe they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself
and then maybe give you another chance to go through it
but you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know but are you working right now anywhere or
okay
oh okay great
yeah that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was going to honeywell a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there and he's doing an internship with ibm
and
they basically did the same exact thing we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug tresting at the same time so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process but
no that's one thing they don't do is drug testing while you're on the job i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it
you know so
that's good i guess i don't know i mean
i
i have gone to a couple of parties since that time and while i don't do any drugs myself i've seen some people who work there
you know smoking a joint or whatever and
you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up
you know but
no they don't they don't really do that
yeah
yes i did this summer did you see it also
well i
i saw i guess i've seen all of kevin's movies so far
well probably i want to see what the reviews look like
well sometimes it's a matter of what the movie is about
even if it doesn't get a good review if it's something i'm interested in i'll probably go see it anyway
and it says basically that this is probably just about the best one that they've ever done
sure it finishes by if this is indeed the final voyage of the original crew star trek six is a worthy valediction
well that can be the case or it can get a great review and be something that i'm not interested in then i'm not going to see it
no i've been reading all the reviews about it but i've never seen it
well
it's called hook it's
well the newspaper suggested that it's perhaps too sweet a movie and that the action sequences might not be as good as other spielberg's movies but it might not be bad overall
no
well no et is going is to stood as an instant classic
no that's the one with demi moore
yeah i've been reading about it but i wasn't all that interested well jeff daniels is in that too isn't he but i wasn't interested
well sometimes there two kind of movies i like to see the ones on the big screen like star trek where you really have to see them on big screen and then the others like say the butcher's wife that are interesting but you can rent them later and watch them on tv without any harm
by watching on video
well you know star wars star trek those kind of movies you've got to see them on big screen or else they lose their effect
well i i've enjoyed star trek but i got people who are friends who are fanatics i have a friend who took off work last friday just to be sure to be in the first group to see it well i'll see i'll see it eventually but i'm not going take the rush
no i think it'll still be playing next month
oh no i'm just it's just interesting to watch
although there's a big story in the paper today a debate between two of the writers one saying the original crew was best and one saying that the new crew was best but you know the debate goes on i suppose
oh boy
where in europe
where in europe did you go
wow
that's not
you say you were there for five years
oh five days uh-huh
uh-huh
i'm sorry i interrupted you was always also saying that you'd gone to rio
that's wonderful
um-hum
so a lot of your big vacations have been international
do you like to travel domestically as well do you do you take vacations around the country now
uh-huh
yes i can relate to that
oh yes
did you ski when you were there
in vail
uh-huh
it's true it's true
because i'm the oldest when i left
my family went on some really fun vacations so it's more the things that i've done with my husband and more recently our child that
that we that i could probably talk about
i'm thirty six and my daughter's only
i mean when my mother was my age i think that i was probably twelve or something like that
it
right
at any rate we've really enjoyed camping vacations i think that that's probably the thing that we've done most each year probably four to seven times a year we'll take short little vacations maybe three days maybe four days
and there's so many places in the san francisco bay area that you can camp that you don't really have to go very far you can drive as little as an hour and get into a redwood forest and feel like you're just
it is really nice to have that very close
there are some places up the coast near mendocino and in marin that have what they call environmental cabins so
you can rent them fairly inexpensively and stay a couple nights and feel like you have a little beach house getaway
so we've done that a few times too you know it's very rustic you don't you bring all your own things and you bring your cooler almost as if you were camping but there's a stove and there's a
a table and platforms for your bed mattress and that sort of thing so it's somewhat set up
those we've really enjoyed i think what i'd like to do when our daughter's a little older
and if we have other kids its the kind of club made med vacations that my husband and i enjoyed several years ago because there's so many different activities
yes they call them club kids
yes they have all kinds of art activities and sports that are tailored for kids and babysitters if you have children that are you know
well what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody i think they should i know i had a job until let's see
a year ago this past december i was working for pie and they closed and naturally while i was working for them i had health insurance
but for me to try to get it now it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at pie
right it really is and i think you know i think the god the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high
well the thing is you know jobs are so hard to find you know and then what you can get out here in anyhow in the valley where i live at now they don't wanna pay anything for health insurance at all
no benefits you know
yes i mean you get a job now and
the wages are really low and
yeah and they don't want to pay any benefits
so you just you know pray to god that you don't get sick
um-hum
um-hum
no i don't understand that either
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well i know the plan that i had with pie i could go to any doctor and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know then i just sent cards in and then
they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that you know
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's true that's true there
well
yeah right
um-hum
but there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything you know that people that's on unemployment
i don't know
yeah probably so i don't know but it is it does seem to be a big problem
you know i don't know what they're gonna come up with but
i sure wish they would come up with something
and like i say and i'm at the age too where the i'll be fifty seven in june and the people don't wanna hire people this age any more
and i worked for my previous company for twenty six years you know so
it's kind of hard you know so
yeah now i do think the government though is gonna have to do something with this problem because it you know even to go to a little doctor out here just to ask him anything costs you forty bucks
you know just for the visit
and then he then that's not counting what medicine you're gonna buy and everything else you know and he might tell you well you know now you're gonna have to come back in a week and then that's another forty bucks plus whatever else he decides to do to you
you think he's worth it
i think they'd be better off trading him off for two million and a half dollar a year pitchers they can win some twelve games each
that's true that's true
i think you're right i think that as long as they keep that management team i don't think there is going to be a winner i agree with you
yeah
well i'd stay for five million bucks a year
well i don't either i think you know the whole
pro sports have gotten out of control and watch a game on tv they got so many ads to pay for the thing if i can fall asleep during a football game wake up and not have missed a missed a down for crying out
and that's the way baseball's going turn into it is they have gone up to last year ninety seconds between innings instead of a minute and
they keep escalating the salaries as they are i think they're going to wind up with as much you know advertising as they do playing ball and it's going to eventually kill the golden goose i think i
oh i enjoy i enjoy them both i
i refereed football for yeah for
well i think amateur you know high school and college is a lot more enjoyable to watch than you know football than the pros
they're just sitting around i last cowboy game i went to they were sitting around between plays so long i don't see how they can break a sweat for heaven sakes you know just waiting on edge
and it it's too bad so
yep
yeah then they got then they got another six more commercials
yep but they won't they want the money you know the
yeah they're greedy and they you know they all admit it's a business and that's what comes first and that's probably what the
is a major problem with the rangers they make money and they don't as long as they make money
hello
yes
good did you get
situation that we aren't going to see a winner this year but
as long as
uh-huh
i do too
um-hum
why is it you know i'm in that same i think if it's
and he goes out and commits another crime or kills somebody i you know i feel the same way i don't think i think that person is beyond
rehabilitation and he should be
taken out
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
right yeah
yeah you don't hear you don't hear too much of that of those cases
yeah
yeah
that's right
huh
right
huh
yep it sure is
um-hum
see the only thing i don't you know i don't understand i guess i don't understand our judicial system as it is right now because i
you know if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death
how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal
and get stays of execution i mean how you know is there
um-hum
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah
um-hum
hm
yep
yeah
hm
yeah
yep
what do you think about
convicted
uh-huh
yeah that's one of the that's also that's also for me invasion of privacy that's also a one of my pet peeves
okay
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
oh i see
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well you know the person to talk to isn't here right now wait a minute i think they're just a minute let me see if they're here and then you leave
and see how long yeah see how long they'll wait but
yeah
yeah right well i
yeah well one of my
tad t a d okay one of my things one of my pet peeves is security numbers
and that is
i'm an adult but i'm going back to school and everywhere on the campus where i write a check it's they want security numbers on everything and i just go bananas
because it's just it's number one it's none of their business and it and it doesn't they want it they want it to be put on your check
right
exactly
and plus in california they have this new thing where they have the magnetic stripe on the back of the driver's license i don't have one yet yes
yes and that's another thing so they think they can plug you in for a profile see and i
in a reader
or something right exactly
but see what's happening though is that it's starting be to they're going to try to integrate it into the stores too
so but the stores can't get all the information
right
but the yeah but in other words so they can they can go in and get the card and get information off it
but the police reader could get more information you might say
but i just i don't like the i don't like the idea of business
and information you know and in the world is coming to is information
oh exactly oh yeah
yeah i did
are you an internet man
yeah
yeah
so do i yeah
okay
i see
yeah
yeah i have an account at school so i'm able to do that
oh i see
so you have a free you dial in free yeah
yeah what is it is it eight hundred number or you just happen to be within the boundaries
oh okay yeah
yeah
okay
you can go first or i will
okay
down in the south we have a lot of shrimp
okay and i have shrimp that is steamed in beer that i cook
and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert
yes and what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your like your rice steamer your rice cooker
and you place the shrimp in the
in the rice steamer and you put a bay leaf and put some red pepper over it
now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can or you can just get some you know regular red peppers
cayenne uh-huh
and you put a little bit of that over it now if you use the dried kind
then you would only use two of them and you put that in there and then you pour two bottles of beer over it
two pounds
that's the jumbo shrimp in the shells leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up
and you pour the beer over the top of it and you cover it and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil
and the shrimp turn pink then you remove it and you put it on a platter and then you serve it with melted butter and
i usually put garlic powder in mine
and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it
but then the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave and what you do is you just wash it and you core it
and in a like a oh what do you call it like pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave
uh-huh but it's got to have one that has a cover on it
and you put about two tablespoons of water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt
and then you just set your cauliflower in there and then you cook it for seven minutes on high and you rotate it one time
uh-huh when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off
and you just set it in there and you microwave it on high for seven minutes and you turn it one time and while that's cooking i take mayonnaise about a cup of mayonnaise
and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder and i mix it all together and i shred up some just regular white cheese
and after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that and you cook it for another three minutes on high
you know just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it and it's done
it is good but it looks i mean what you can do then see is like what i usually do is i'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle and then i put the shrimp around the outside of it you know on my platter
and then i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that
and you know you have all the different seasonings and stuff and then i just fix little individual cups for them and they have the garlic bread and it makes it a real nice looking
you know
right and usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it you know and i'll lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that
okay it usually serves six
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah have you ever had crawfish
oh you ought to try some crawfish they are good but see that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over
you know even if it's like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking
you know they want it from down here
because just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out you know and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is
but
it's similar uh-huh
yeah it's not exactly i mean it's got a taste of its own you know but it is it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it
it looks more like a crab
uh-huh
but
no
let me think of
but you know it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would
but i mean they're fantastic tasting they are so good everybody it's the season for them right now
louisiana
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yes
yeah you know
you buy it you buy it as a seasoning
huh-uh i cook mine well do you have a like a black iron skillet
oh okay well i guess you could cook it in that too but i don't know you know i never have i use the black iron skillet to cook mine
uh-huh but it really it's not it doesn't burn or anything like that the blackening is really the seasoning
i mean there is it's a blackening seasoning
you know i mean that is a seasoning that's really it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it
because it's called
what it's called is blackening magic and it comes in a bottle and
well i'm trying to see it's got a picture of dom de luise on it
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
but
uh-huh
yeah
but you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it i mean your pan it does have to be really hot you know when you put it in but it's not like it's burned and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning
and it is so good oh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well have you ever thought about coming to louisiana you know to visit
yeah you ought to come down you don't even have to go all the way to new orleans you know if you want to really get some good food
i mean you don't have to go that far south
but
of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as i'm concerned and fact is we're going to take a vacation this year we're going to go to new orleans again and
we're only going down there for the food though
yeah we go to the french quarters and stuff like that and i have some friends that live down there
and so usually we go to we don't go to the tourist ones we go to the ones that they tell us to go to you know
and we went to this one it was called the back porch and
and usually if you can find somebody of course now when you go down there you know i mean they've got just there's no where you can miss
i have never gone to a restaurant and not just been so full it's unreal and i mean it's so good the seasoning they it's just unreal
gumbo
no gumbo uh-huh right
uh-huh you can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i'll tell you what
hum
yeah
hum
hum well i think we're on maybe i guess we'll find out so in maryland are you are you a skins fan
yeah
oh okay so you were out there in san francisco
oh yeah
oh
yeah it's other than the big catch with the 49ers and the cowboys back a few years ago i like san francisco
but i don't know i never really was a cowboys fan until i moved down to texas yeah i'm in dallas
and i guess when you're down here in dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the cowboys because you know this is a big football territory down here and
unfortunately of course the cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years that i don't know everybody's kind of they're still behind them but it's not like it used to be
a philosophy for oh i don't know probably the last you know twenty five years except for the last about five or six years they always went out and tried to draft the best athletes
and didn't really put them draft for any particular spot but they would go out and try to go for the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche
and then about five years ago four or five years ago they started going after specific players or positions
you know like the press would get down on landry and this is when schramm was still there and they'd go after them saying jeez what you really need is a defensive end
and so they'd go out and try to find a defensive end when they when they drafted somebody and he didn't workout at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else
and so i think it was kind of interesting i think the decline of the of the cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with not drafting people the best athletes
yeah
but
yeah
they still have some draft picks that they got no actually they picked up some from minnesota
i think it was minnesota's run yeah
that's okay they i've got a friend that lives right next to the cowboys' training camp
and he gets he sees them out running a lot and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys and they're all they're all thinking that man they really got something going this year
but i guess when you have a whole bunch of professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes
you know i guess it's the same way with baseball or anybody you know spring training until you actually start going out and getting
getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good
yeah really
yeah really
yeah they did as a matter of fact
yeah
oh okay
jeez
well course
yeah oh yeah
yeah course then you're not that far from philadelphia
oh okay i it was buddy ryan the one that i can't
stand too much
yeah really
oh
um-hum
actually you said you lived near baltimore you're out i used to travel out that way a lot and actually i used to drive a lot between baltimore and washington and
no
oh okay
yeah
i used to go out of bwi a lot
oh yeah
is that near the what do they i forgot the name of it is it the wharf or the inner harbor
yeah
great
hum
yeah
i tell you what i there's the colts still you know still to me are the baltimore colts you know
oh okay
jeez yeah so you know did you graduate from purdue
delaware oh
there's not a whole lot in delaware
yeah that's true i take it you're an east coast type guy
boy me too it's fly by the seat of my pants
in the old days when my wife and i both worked we probably a little bit more organized with it
because we would divide up the bills she had her own checking account and she would take responsibility for paying so many bills and i had my own and i would take responsibility for so many and
and generally entertainment expense so everything seemed to work out pretty smoothly
but that was for about the first eighteen years of our marriage
then she dropped out of the work force and
we have two children both under four so
yeah
be yeah they'll be four and two in april respectively
forty two yeah most of my friends have children who are having children it seems like
um-hum
yeah
yeah i think when we were both running separate checking accounts i think there was more of a sense of respectful responsibility
now it's my paycheck i put it in and i pay the bills and it doesn't i'm not being critical but my wife kind of has
the sense that the checkbook is just a blank check
you know and it's unlimited funds not that she goes out and spends it unlimitedly but it's almost that attitude
yeah right yeah that's yeah that's kind of how it comes out
um-hum
yeah well how do you manage control or limit your spending or you know do you
in our in our case it's more of a philosophy like you know for the next few months we're really going to watch it and we'll try to control the big
um-hum
well that's how we both are
yeah we
yeah we went through a period well we went through six years of infertility
and it was expensive we were writing out checks for you know eight hundred dollar prescriptions and medical procedures and all of that
and then we got to the point where we really decided we probably couldn't have children so we sort of indulged and we
leased some expensive cars and took a vacation yeah it
well that's what exactly what happened yeah
thank you same to you
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
you may assume that being from utah a member of the mormon church and we do a lot of missionary work and i spent two years when i was nineteen in argentina
and i'll tell you that gives you a different perspective of you know some of the things we have here in this country that people really don't appreciate
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh sure you bet
um-hum
yeah so
well i think it would be a good idea is a it is kind of a delicate time but
by the same token at that age they haven't really settled down don't have a family or other commitments as well and so there's some divantages to going at that particular time in your life
yeah
um-hum
yeah that's certainly my was my experience just
and having a gas fired water heater you know things that we really appreciate are not commonplace in every in every city that i was living in
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
okay
yeah it
uh-huh
yeah that's what mine is
uh-huh
now i've got a portable cordless is that what you're using
okay i got a i i'm using a cordless
right
uh-huh
okay
yeah it is
dogs and cats
that your cat your rex
uh-huh
oh really
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh
oh
this guy at that i work with raises birds he has a
a macaw
and parakeets and something else he one of those parrots
yeah a i think it's a cockatoo
did it really
um-hum
those are expensive
did she ever get it back
oh that's
uh-huh
yeah my daughter had one i wouldn't have one flying around my house
yeah
boy that's a shame
uh-huh
um-hum
don't you miss them now i mean
because they're they have such personalities
um-hum
yeah
right
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah right
yeah right
yeah
yeah you know you think you're you think that's what you want and i really gave it a good try
this is a fifty pound dog i'm going to pick up a leg at a time and wash and set it down on something clean while i got the other three you know and then i'd let her in the house well still even putting her feet in the bucket of water and wash them real good
she still would come in so fast and so heavy that she'd dig her paws deep down into my carpet you know and just take out running to and she would
oh she was ruining my carpet and i thought gosh i love my new house more than i love her i think you know i just really have a big investment and i don't i just
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
but now see i have always felt that i could always smell cats
cats to me i used to have some friends' house that i couldn't stand to go in their house i could smell their litter box i thought oh my god i couldn't stand it and i don't know how they stood it i guess they didn't smell it
oh do you
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that's right
well i wouldn't either
uh-huh
well i know is there're supposed to be is it chihuahuas they're supposed to be good for asthma they say chihuahua dogs are supposed to be good for people with asthma i always heard
oh yeah and don't i think they're using you know they're using animals in old folks home now and some hospitals because it's supposed to make people
brings your blood pressure down you know dogs are always so happy to see you come home you know they always are just wagging i don't care how grumpy you are or what dogs are glad to see you
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh
see i was thinking about buying a horse maybe i don't want
uh-huh
just to
oh
uh-huh
i think i'll just go rent a horse if i want to ride one
yeah
no i mean well i do enjoy my dog she's such a
oh she's my best friend and when i lived in orlando she got paralyzed from her waist down and waist
and i thought it was
we almost had to put her to sleep and i just cried for two days but i think what i ironically what happened was she had fleas
and i think it was the stuff i was putting on her that paralyzed her but
the fleas i think's what brought her back is she had to scratch so bad that she started using her the doctor was just amazed at a that she came back because
he really was going to was going to do surgery for fifteen hundred dollars or put her to sleep and i was going to have to opt to have to put her to sleep even as much as i loved her i wasn't going to spend fifteen hundred dollars on an experiment
no but it was just that spot that they put on the back of a dog they used to use it on cattle and so i started using it on her and i'd take to her to the vet once a month and get that spot put on her
and she wouldn't have any fleas never had any fleas hadn't never any then all of a sudden i took her
i was living in orlando and i put her in the vet while i came home to dallas for a while and i took and when i picked her up she had fleas again
and so my daughter came down and visited me from dallas and while she was there the dog got paralyzed
and so i took her back up to the doctor and
anyway he said it wasn't that but
another doctor told me that there had been people the pet owners had been getting permanently paralyzed from petting the dogs that had that spot on them
so i thought well so i can't find a vet that'll do that for me anymore put the spot on her anymore and i don't want it anymore anyway
but i do fight fleas oh gosh
yeah
oh i moved back in eighty eight the december of eighty eight
yeah i lived here before i'd worked for ti for seventeen years and then i moved to orlando with mark and marietta
and let me talk about fleas we have nothing compared to fleas down they have down there
and they have them year round at least they die out kind of in the wintertime here in the yard down there they don't they're are just and they are big suckers i mean big
and they are just almost impossible to get rid of it costs a fortune if you have a pet you're going to have fleas down there
and i just had my house treated and treated and treated and treated and i did all the things you're supposed to and i couldn't get rid of
dining out seems to be a something we do off and on
through our lives i guess as economics and as kids come and go and situations change we used to do
quite a bit of dining out before the children and then as they came along and additional expenses sitting came into every dinner out
that halted a lot of it as well as just the oh i guess the lifestyle changes a little bit slows down a little bit and
now even the atmosphere that we would seek when we go out is often more quiet and
a little bit more subdued not smoke filled or bar dance floor type yeah so
that those type of qualities have moved into the picture and then there's some economic concern but usually it's if it's going to be a night out it's going to be a decent meal and
and fortunately for us there's not a whole lot of places in the immediate area that's totally really expensive you have to go a ways to get to a really
high dollar hundred and fifty dollar dinner type deal which they're forty to fifty miles away and they're all around but they're just a ways so we can do a good
twenty five dollar night out and have a decent steak and it comes out okay
we look for i guess service you know i'm not i'm not in
eating at mcdonald's long enough the fastest the speed of it doesn't bother me you know i'm not looking for fast food at that night so the fact that it took them twenty thirty minutes to get it there that's okay i'm
that's twenty minutes away from the kids or however long you know you're out for the evening or it doesn't really matter that they not get it there right away but
have a little chime little hard time finding a place that'll cook the steak just right i have to remember how to ask for it for this given restaurant to get it just the way i like it without too much pink in there and get it cooked good
yeah there seem to be quite a few quite a few
um-hum steak and lobster type
yeah they do oddly enough even being near the gulf they tend to advertise the main
the whole east coast seafood for some reason it tends to be a draw i don't know particularly why i mean to me it tastes pretty much the same once you do to it whatever you're going to do to it you know like
yeah crab and lobster and
yeah they withdraw from that i guess you know you can ship stuff anywhere pretty much and
probably i'm not a big fan of that so i wouldn't be paying much attention to it
right
um-hum
right
right
uh-huh
right
there's a one place that
really not sure if the marketing concept is carried throughout it's chain but in this particular town i live about two suburbs north of dallas actually and in this particular town we're about two miles from this
this steak house that has a
oh i don't know a motif to the entire shopping center it's the anchor for this entire strip shopping center i guess and they'll the entire place is
has covered walkways all around to all the little shops that are they're not
they're not even individual shops in some cases some cases are just kind of you they put it all out in a little store shed out on to an area and then they put it all away at night then there are there's one two whole rows actually of
of just what we would call a stall of flat concrete place with little posts and they're all marked off with little lines and so if you want to rent this little spot though the farmers bring their stuff down and have a farmers market type
so we went to this steak house once well several times but the most particular time that we were away from the kids and had a good length of time and it was on a friday night and we knew the place would be really busy but we
we got there about six or six thirty and put our names on the list of the waiting list and then we walked around the place that has
there were still some farmers there at the time there was a lot of hand craft type stuff being sold there was a blacksmith and he's showing off his little traits and things that he could sell as well as
the hallways between the places that were of business the hallways were decorated with old pictures and history of the of the town as it were
we killed about a an hour or so doing that because it was about an hour and a half wait to get into the restaurant and then about thirty minutes worth of a meal or so thirty or forty five minutes there and then
came back out and walked around a little bit more and went home so it it's quite an interesting deal they don't even take reservations because they're so booked like that
hum
right
i guess i'm calling to tell you about my exercise program which is a little bit lacking right now i've slacked off in the last six months but for several years i have walked three miles a day
are you and that my walking was a fast walk to get the heart rate up to an aerobic level
and i in fact i was enjoying it so much that i was doing it like seven days a week and i pretty i pretty much had to cut that back though to five
i well it was about three
but and it was i was it was so much fun to watch the progress because
as i went along when i started at first i had to i didn't have to use my arms all that much to you know get the heart rate up but then after about
four weeks then i had to use them all the time and then i had to i found that i had to raise them above my head and kind of down my back to get the heart rate up so it was very it was progressive
yeah i thought well now i guess probably six weeks before i had to do my arms the whole time the whole twenty minutes
oh gosh yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i think may be you like doing it alone you like doing it on your own time too
um-hum
i think so to well and i was very pleased when during cold weather and i haven't lived in charlotte north carolina a full year yet but
when i lived in a colder climate i had access to one of those schwinn bicycles
the ones that you know you have to use your arms also and so on those days i did thirty minutes on the bike now that was a little boring because i did it alone
and you know you can't read very well if you're using your arms and
you can't put a book on that on the handlebars but that was i was very lucky there but here i have dogs that i take on long walks
and that makes it a lot better to have their company
but as i said i'm not doing it quite as well now because we're in a temporary situation and what i had also found that i guess it's like certain addictions
once it well it it's easier to quit if you start
stopping shall i say and if you skip some days then it's awfully hard to get back to a regular routine
um-hum
sure
yes
yes
um-hum well and i had support from my husband too which is very nice he felt that i needed to put that first and i don't believe a lot of woman always have that kind of support
hum-um yes
hum-um
then you thought yes i've had those and i think they're excellent
um-hum oh i'm sure oh my gosh yes i think it's wonderful i've had it and on a regular basis and
i found it a lot more fatiguing than my walking program in fact
yes well it's been fun talking to you and i wish you lots of luck with your endeavors
that's okay it it's more concentrated so they know where you are
if you bring your bags back to the store to recycle
then they'll pay you a certain amount of money and that's one thing that started in the community
um-hum
um-hum yeah i know kroger will do it and i think albertson's does it sometimes i'm not sure
some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the
the community like through the schools or things like that
the can different can banks around the city
that you can go to and do that
one of the ways i don't know if this would be helpful it said on the
the computer what do i think would be helpful and i don't know if it would be helpful or not but i know on monday the garbage men pick up like just
any limbs or any extra trash that you might have
and that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a certain
colored can to put them in or something in the city to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever
yeah
yeah
yeah
do that
recycling minded as i should be but that goes out with the trash and it really could be recycled
so
did you
tell me
um-hum
now do you have to take like labels off of those jars
uh-huh
yeah
take them off yeah
soda both liter sodas can you do that okay
right
i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just get it into different categories like that and
i don't know what it would take to get my children to start working on it i
i have two older ones that probably would go along with the if i had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project you know
okay
yeah
uh-huh
oh
do you have any interest in gun control do you would you like to start first go ahead oh yeah that's right
yeah i guess i would pick a five i'm not quite sure i share an interest of guns and i have some guns and i have two brothers-in-law who when we get together we go plinking and one of them hunts and so it's talked about it
i don't quite understand the nra's cia type stand it seems to me they'd be
guns can become an a hobby and it they take the approach of too hard nosed on it and i don't quite understand i don't i mean i my brother-in-law hunts and he doesn't need a automatic or semiautomatic gun to hunt
and i don't quite understand the uzis and all that i think those should be banned i think that oh yeah hunters should get whatever they think they need but heck we've had hunting rifles for a hundred years and so
they're certainly not uzis and things like that you know
oh that's
oh yeah that i think that's great that's a great attitude
no
right
right
they had twenty twos
yeah well i agree
right you're there you go i think that's a that's a i
you've eaten raccoon and possum
oh my goodness and
oh yeah
yeah
oh yeah and i
i don't
i don't know why the i always said i'm probably a five although i haven't really that's not a very well thought out since they gave a number system
my brother-in-law one of them hunts and the other one is a real collector and we get together we go shooting and i've been a lot of plinking and as a kid you know as a teenager we'd go to the rifle range and everything and shoot twenty twos and everything
problems we have in society is like today some teenager locally here in the metroplex
used a twenty two whatever and it's on the news if you listen to the news tonight and went after his teacher and fired three or four shots at the school now
to me gun control is not going to control it but the parents you know a teenager you know below eighteen or whatever the age should be right guns should be an adult should be responsible now i think that if you have a gun an adult
then you have a responsibility for whether you call it locking it up or putting it somewhere where absolutely no teenager can get to it
that's oh well that includes little kids too yeah
yeah
right
i'm not sure it should be part of a crime bill i think i think guns need controls intelligent controls but i don't think it has maybe a one percent relationship directly to crime
buying uzis and all that may you know i think that the cops should have the best weapons and whatever they need but i don't think the average plinker or hunter needs to go out and buy be able to buy that i don't think he should
be allowed to buy an uzi or something
oh yeah
i know it's shooting against people you know they go out i i've seen them on tv and they actually have these little clubs where they go out and practice shooting each other you know i mean yeah and i think it should be in the hunting realm
i don't know why the nra doesn't have nice range you talk about a range you're right ranges are hard to we have them here in arlington i have one here in fort worth i go to but i would think the r nra would take the positive side and open up some nice
yeah
well my
my brother-in-law's in san antonio and he they're closing the ranges they're slowly but surely closing so when i go here in fort worth it's in south part of fort worth it is run very well of course it has guns to buy
but they have a state trooper i guess he's in his spare time he's always there with a forty five automatic on his side so that that's the only range i've been to that has a cop there
right no i think that's the i've seen him there are some real amateurs that yeah there's some real amateurs that come i saw one time when somebody came with a
non-hunting one of these and he was just you know moving it around waving it well pardon me
no he's just there to tell everybody hey this is where you aim and watch it you're endangering the rest of the people
and of course when you go and take your targets down he's there to make sure that people that's what it was people did not totally unload their guns when you when you take your targets down you walk in front of your own guns
and he would just look over everyone's shoulder and say hey your gun's not unloaded you know you have to unload because you walk out there in this particular range in fort worth now the other ranges it's always somebody else but
the inspector would come by and say or the rifle range owner would come by and look at everyone's gun before he would step in front of you and so you need some sort of common sense as well as expertise with a gun before you put a bunch of dummies out there in front with guns now
oh yeah that's great yeah
that's a good question yeah the i own i have girls so they haven't been in does scouting have a gun section where they teach them twenty twos and all that oh that's great that's great i think that's the way it should be
they just plink
yeah
yeah i again that's why i don't think it should be part of a criminal or a crime bill because they
yeah but we have to look ahead because we we've had the two hundred years worth of or longer rather we came over with guns four hundred years i guess you might say and i think we have to look at it as it's not going to solve it next week we just got to look
for the next ten or twenty years you know what kind of gun not controls gun legislature should we have and then it'll slowly change it's going to take twenty five years or so
maybe to get the guns into a controlled atmosphere where the true hunter you know it has a registered gun and people that allow other children to get access to a gun should be fined you
yeah
we just went through an experience
both my parents passed away fairly young and
but he always maintained his own apartment he lived in the city he lived in rhode in fact we live in rhode island i work in the massachusetts plant but i live in rhode island
he's always lived in the in the city and he's always been kind of independent he's
he got around yeah because he lived right down city in the in the
port authorities right there so he used to take the steamer down to new york and you know i mean he went
yeah he went everywhere he wanted to go
no and then about a year and a half ago he started having mini strokes
he
he still didn't want to give up his apartment
and
finally a year ago last thanksgiving my wife tried to call him and he wouldn't answer the phone so we kind of expected the worse so i went down
and he had another stroke and i found him he was just he was just standing in the middle of the room all covered with shaving cream he always trying to shave and he didn't know who i was so we brought him up to stay with us
and he snapped out of it
he
he was probably
say ninety five percent himself
and while he was in the hospital he had a massive stroke
and it crippled him
so he didn't have the use of his arm or his leg or and then he lost the ability to speak
and we're not sure but we think that he was
very hard of hearing to begin with his almost his whole entire life
so we figured that his hearing deteriorated even further and his eyesight
we did as much as we could for him and then it got to the point where we couldn't handle him anymore
my wife couldn't she couldn't get him up
so
the alternative was to put him back in the hospital which we did and they took care of him you know and he slowly deteriorated and
and then they said that there was nothing more that they could do for him and he had to go into a nursing home the doctor said that he couldn't come back with us
because we couldn't take care of him
and we started looking around and they said no the first nursing home that's closest to you that has an available bed is where he's going to go
so we didn't have much of a choice
well at least up here so he went in there anyhow and my wife went in there every day to see him and you know she
at first at first no
you get them in you do what you have to do for them and that's it
so i would go on weekends and she would go during the day to visit him and they had a laundry you know they had the whole facility was there but
closed up most of the time so she'd go in and she'd do his laundry for him and she'd go in and feed him and
and it got to the point where they we knew them just as much as they knew us and they really cared for him at you know he was in there for almost six months
with the nursing home right and it was run the nursing home was run by
regular staff but it was owned by seventh day adventists
which was a surprise to us you know we didn't realize that they had i guess
but most of the people were
well they didn't have anything to do with it they owned it
but they
i suppose they cared how it was run but they had an administrator that ran it and most of the people were
but i think only because my wife spent so much time there she was there i mean every single day during the week and then on weekends we would go in the both of us
and she would do things and she would donate little things and she'd help clean up the tables and you know that type of thing so
they'll be abused but you hear horror stories all the time
but if you care
then it makes a difference those people
that have a lot of visitors
and we had a gentleman that
yeah in fact
we go down to see him she goes down occasionally maybe once or twice a week just to see him
and i'll stop in maybe once or once or twice a month on the weekend i'll go down to see him
yes but he gets out he can get out you know he can he's got a lot of friends and they take him here and they take him there so he's not as bad off as some of the people because some of them are in there and in the six months that my father-in-law was in there
i've seen a lot of them that didn't have any visitors whatsoever at least while i was there
yeah they just
yeah and we had an old dog an old shepherd they were inseparable my father-in-law and the dog we brought the dog down there and it was nice and all the old people oh look at the dog and
well most people don't do that you know they don't they don't they figure once you're in there you forget everything and that's really not the case and it's sad
i hope that i never get into that situation where you know the kids will say well okay dad you know here you go
i think i'll walk off into the mountains somewhere or out into the
but yeah and you know and there's something to say for that i think
right they do and the people that
that have families that don't
okay what do you do this weekend
hum which is what do you plan have planned for your yard
um-hum
hum what part of the state do you live in
oh okay
okay my wife and i we live in dallas too
yeah just what that area we're planning on moving to flower mound and we're going to be getting some
seems like it the place we've been living at it's we're just leasing in
the in plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content
i mean just scratching two or three inches was just a chore
it was it was
it's horrible
it's a nightmare but
yeah
i know right where that's at
um-hum
really
golly
is it is it limestone under underneath or
how do you put trees in there
hum
oh
yeah
um-hum
oh yeah
oh yeah we tried planting tomatoes last year and it they turned out pretty poor
it it's amazing we also have roses and i mean they just grow so beautifully
what type roses
oh hybrid teas
yeah we have a few of the real short stem they're kind of like the bush roses but
i don't know i think it's i think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a it's a really old bush and
but i i'm amazed because the sun is so intense and the roses just seem to survive just fine there
um-hum
and
yeah have you have you done a done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not
yeah
yeah just if you want a lot of you know light for underneath
that may be the all right because we had because we have some we have some old fruit trees we have a plum that's just about ready to go so we may just be
getting rid of that but our peaches they seem to be doing just fine but they really need pruning it just seems like they that
that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough but the way they behave
i don't know
but
but what kind of what kind of what kind of grass are you growing
bermuda
yeah
oh i've been trying a mixture of the bermuda and the rye
and but i may be working like a fescue in because of you know the type of weather
it seems that bermuda's fine but it looks like it would hold the soil but it really doesn't
a lot of a lot silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well
but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime
but boy once it gets over seventy five degrees that it just dries up shrivels up and dies
but
yeah
my parents-in-law they're building a house into the side of a hill well it's already been built and everything
they've been living there for about three months now but this is out in west texas but the wind there has been so bad that
i mean they've tried to plant grass and they just have some problems big time problems they just they just washing
watching their lawn just blow away oh yeah
but it's
but it's quite an undertaking they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property
on a on the side of a hill it's beautiful i mean you can see the house from
you know miles away but it's you know
it's a pretty neat little job but they save a lot of they save a lot of energy but
just you know for them i mean they they're going to have to start gardening it's going to be from the ground up
i mean the whole way
and they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed
it's amazing i mean they have the all they have are mesquite and cottonwoods
and it's all on lake greenbelt that property out there and
i don't know that what they have they have all the water they want they can they can actually they can pump water i mean they have to get permission but they can pump water up from the shore
but
that's for like an additional they have to pay like some kind of fee per year
but
they're right now though i think they're just they're trying to get the trees planted and everything
but man i just think of all of the money that they that they're going to have to spend just getting that
but the taxes alone there lake greenbelt and some places they really they over tax
and i mean your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes
it's ridiculous
yeah no it's not it's because even though it's far out there it's just that lake greenbelt you know they have to
they try to do it just from the selling the water but
the water usage you know they try to limit even though there's three or four streams that flow into it
people still use it enough in like in towns like clarendon and other areas that where they irrigate
they huh they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming but the irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years
but
i don't know i just came back from there and just the air is so dry i don't see how anything can survive out there
they're pretty smart they're smart they're about the smartest tree around they don't they don't even start growing until may or april
like after it's been raining for a few months they say the roots have developed so that's all they work on just a leafy they don't do anything
um-hum
i know my wife and i we planted on the
on the south side of our of our house we planted some gardenias and they did real fine during the summertime it's just
but during the fall when it stopped when the rain let off just a little bit it i mean it just dried up
and so i guess it these plants they just they don't it's like they remain
good
cross-stitch and needle point uh-huh
and you do crocheting
well i don't whether we can call it a hobby or not and many years ago music was a hobby to me
but as i have gotten older i found out that music has taken over about half of my time
and now that i'm i retired about not quite a month ago that'll be i guess most of my efforts
well i
yes i play violin in three different symphony orchestras a local one here in state college and then one in altoona which is oh forty five miles away and
and another one at the lockhaven university which is about forty five fifty miles away
and i formed what is called a state college municipal band oh about ten fifteen years ago
i play trumpet in that and conduct occasionally once in a while
so i'm pretty busy in keeping that band going and trying to keep my violin playing up to an acceptable level of these other orchestras
but i don't
um-hum i have so little opportunity i am hopefully the next year or so going to rebuild my station and get back on the air a little bit more consistently
i do have the equipment but as the antennas blew down the last few years i just went off the air and that was the end of that
it is it's a very interesting thing to talk to people all over the world it's what it amounts to
depends upon the frequency and how good of an antenna you have and how conditions are about every eleven or twelve years conditions change
man i have at one time or another talked almost not every country in the world but in all areas of the world
i oh i have when i was really active i had well over a hundred different countries that i had talked to
yeah um-hum fairly consistently yeah well tell me about this work that you do and do you display these sell them or how do
um-hum
you know that sounds exactly like things that pat does
that is a shame
um-hum
yeah and this is something that you would make into one square and hang on the wall is the way you do it uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
where do you get the information to that enables you to do these different pictures are they already worked out so that you know
um-hum
yeah
hum
yeah i can hear him
uh-huh
right
and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him
oh my
yeah so the convenience
right
my grandmother lived with us until august and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home she has leukemia
and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in dayton and were several thousand miles away
so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home and my sister being on the other end found one
that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and tv set so
yes and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
so she didn't have to be transported back and forth so she's been there since august the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well it's not her favorite place to be in she'd much rather be here with me but
when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her and i've got little children here who needed me here
she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day
so
she was falling down and hemorrhaging and you know all kinds of physical problems so it just became too much for me to handle even though i would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh
yeah
yes
well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions it sure wouldn't have been granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now
well we enjoyed having her here but we feel she's much safer where she is now she still continues to fall but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her
and i know she's eating the right things and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her so
it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
so i think she'll adjust
well they just kicked it off down here in sarasota county
they've got these on it's county wide program now and what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage yard trash
plastic cans and glass
and then paper
which in the paper it's just newspaper and corrugated cardboard is the only thing you're supposed to put in there no slicks
yeah
um-hum
yeah
oh what is the name of that company it's not amway but it's the other big vitamin company shaklee
okay and she's just shaklee crazy you know because it's her business and everything and
they don't want it to change their lifestyle and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything which that's what recycling at home sorting does you know i mean it's a little extra work and
it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do what they do here in sarasota county is they've got
okay you put your garbage in a garbage bag and you set it out by the curb if you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container
or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub and it's about a foot and a half deep and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long
this is a little container and they have another one the same size that one's red and then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods
and so like
you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans otherwise you got bees and ants and you know and if you've got food containers or anything like that it's a big problem so not only do you
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
-is is true this is true
um-hum
yeah they've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here if you wanna have a nice garbage can you know and it's on wheels and it's big
yeah
well i think in i think in the city they do but out here in the county you have to rent them
and they just add it on to your water bill or something
east of sarasota um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah about an hour about an hour south of tampa
those guys they just kind of get into
so i'm listening to that i kind of got an idea that i thought would be good was and this kind of fits into the aid program the welfare program that's going on right now
they're a lot of work that's for sure yes
yeah
uh-huh
yeah right yes
uh-huh
ah
well i think i've had it once and it's been a few years ago but i do recall that it was quite good so
yeah so that is her specialty i like to bake also i don't bake so much now that my children are grown but i do enjoy baking and i guess i always liked making
well it's interesting that yesterday i had lunch with a friend and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend for friends of hers for a
one of her acquaintances one of her old friends i guess had been in town and they invited two other couples over and so there were seven of them but i said well what did you have and she said what she had just mexican food but you know she had you know guacamole and
i can't remember all she had but she also had made flan which is actually spanish i think have you ever made that or had it
it's it it's
actually not very difficult to make but it's very high in cholesterol i'm sure with all the eggs that are in it but
she said that she and her husband had traveled in spain a couple of years ago and flan is almost a basic with every meal that you get there
yeah uh-huh it's just very customary to get flan so if you ever run into that you'll sort of be aware of what that's all about but i would never have thought of making that as part of a mexican dinner but
i tell you it that i my it's one of those things where it does require some real planning and it's you know you don't just make the dinner you have your house to clean and you know the whole business that goes with that
oh
uh-huh
oh
oh wow that's such a nice thing it's i you know until well we my husband and i've been married twenty six years and until last year i had never had another person clean my house and then i got so involved and so busy i said
uh-huh
you don't have it yeah i would i
uh-huh
right
quite large yeah
right
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah what is it about the vinegar that makes the crust better
ah
interesting
yeah boy that's the that's the real secret
when i was visiting my mother-in-law in michigan and she lived very near an apple orchard and
we just had we could take as many apples as we wanted from it you know according to the owners and so i decided to bake about four pies ahead you know and freeze them
where about
uh-huh well we lived in plymouth for four years
yeah in fact i we were there from seventy three to seventy seven and i was i worked for the little the weekly newspaper there the plymouth oh what was it called crier and
my husband is from the upper peninsula so he was born and raised up there and that's where my mother-in-law still lives so are you originally from michigan or uh-huh
i'll be darn and
okay
and i told her when we got married that i am going to earn so much money and she can spend it on what she wants but if she ever spends more than i earn she's got to go to work she's never gone to work yet so
so it worked
so it's so you know it's really great
um-hum
yep
um-hum
um-hum
yeah you live right in new york city
uh-huh
uh-huh so your rent is quite expensive as compared to what we're accustomed to back here probably
oh i see
oh yeah
retirement investment programs very much so
nowadays you sound like you're fairly young so i you know i keep telling my kids for god's sakes get involved in it because when they retire they should have a half dollars
um-hum
i'm fifty eight so
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
so i just took on another mortgage don't ask me why i really don't but it's tax
i've had no i've had four no not all at the same time
right
it's i'll start off here i don't know i get probably most of my information either from the newspaper or from cnn
i like cnn because it you know repeats it well headline news repeats every half hour and so it makes it really convenient because i keep a rather hectic schedule
and but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from
right
um-hum
right
yeah i know the my only major objection is that i don't think american media spends enough attention on our closest neighbors like mexico and canada
um-hum yeah
right yeah i mean you know canada's going through a lot of problems now with quebec and everything and
it's amazing that you know i listen to dc area and the washington post you know i mean the most they'll give it is maybe the back of the a section
you know
um-hum
yeah definitely
yeah
um-hum
right
right exactly yeah i spent this past summer up in canada well part of it touring
and you know i was amazed because i'd pick up a local paper and i'd read about all of these you know really interesting things going on there's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a canada you know in the next five years
you know because of the problems with quebec and i had never heard any of that before
um-hum
right
oh yeah
um-hum
yeah i've i guess i've never seen the tv show i used to get the
um-hum
yeah
yeah it's i don't know it's you know i lived in basically it's a suburb of washington dc
a lot of the problems that dc has to deal but you know
you know trying to kill others kids and you know it's outrageous you know
like you hit the nail on the head probably that all comes from you know lack of a good family structure
for this people you know they just
yeah i don't you know
figure out which is which
but i don't know you know it i don't think there was much of a problem until crack started hitting the streets really
yeah because that's cheap and incredibly addictive and
you know that seems to be the target choice of the you know poor inter-city people
cocaine and marijuana i don't they really were after that i don't think they really touch that much
well that's true that's true
a pretty nice car
um-hum
yeah but doesn't help the home mechanic that much unless they've got a you know some way to decode all that information
um-hum
um-hum
hum
right
hum interesting
yeah
yeah i think that's probably the key thing you know the key thing so you've got
single mothers who are trying to raise kids and you know are off working all day and the kids are on their own
you know that much guidance they're going to get into trouble and
you know now good stable family structure keep them straight or you know father figure to look up to or anything
um-hum
yeah about somethings but i don't you know
for the more important things about life i think a lot of kids are missing
they're out for the quick buck mentality
you know who they gets defined by what kind of tennis shoes they wear
and you know they don't have
really kind of deep personal values anymore you know what
so what's your favorite team or do you have a favorite team or
bengals
yeah
i was pulling for the bengals when they lost the super bowl
two years ago was it
yeah i pulled for them for the sole reason because i didn't want 49ers to win
anybody who plays the 49ers really
yeah
yeah that's true my favorite team is are is are the raiders
yeah i mean i've liked them ever since the season that they won the super bowl last i think it was eighty four i think it was
and i pretty much like them ever since that
and they haven't they haven't produced since then but
but
least i've stuck with them i'm loyal
yeah
yeah what other teams do you like up there
or do you not watch much football
oh really
every sunday and monday
oh that's right
yeah me neither it's kind of like they gave me the topic and i'm like football jeez it's been a long time
did you know that they're playing a game today
yeah
they're playing it right now
yeah the temperature's just not right
yeah
we usually don't we usually don't have very cold weather down here you know during football season it gets colder later on in the season
but it takes a good while for it to get cold
but couple christmases ago we had a freak storm
and i live near the coast actually i live like right on the coast of north carolina
and what they called it like a winter hurricane and so instead of bringing high winds and destruction and rain it just brought a lot of snow and basically it rain it snowed only on the coast but not inland
yeah and so we you know because being near the water we get less snow than anybody else
and this time we had a bunch of snow we i had fun playing in the snow playing football in the snow
and so i mean i had never done that before and it's so much fun because you can hit harder and land harder and it doesn't matter because it's snow and yeah
yeah well we had like layers of clothing to keep away the snow
yeah
but the snow also helps you know and it we had like one foot deep snow in this in this open field and so it was a little hard to run but when you got hit and you fell you didn't really feel it
you just felt the hit of the person but when you hit the ground it was you know just snow it was it was pretty fun but it's a lot better to play it in the cold weather that's true
well right now we're having nice weather i probably say in the upper sixties maybe lower seventies right now
yeah especially at this time
yeah is it very windy up there now
yeah we had some pretty strong winds pick up this morning and they've been up been with us all day
well
yeah this is the first time i've talked with someone up north really mostly i've been talking with people in texas
yeah nice talking to you too bye
yes
i
yeah i suspect the apathy is due to something like people just feeling that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why bother voting if
if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh bush is going to win either way why bother voting
that's right i think that's and the other side of the coin is people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not going to win so some are saying dukakis is certainly not going to win why bother voting for him so
i think that's a big a big a big reason for it how about
that's true actually i never thought about that that's a good
that's true that's true
um-hum that
i think on the local elections it's actually i think i think people vote in the larger elections because
they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know
and i think wrongly figuring that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that they don't have
that it doesn't matter as much whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true
i think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level
right
right but
yeah that that's possible i still think that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well
i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway
you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under i would guess
that portion of the population is massively under represented and
hum what do they have to do with one another
oh so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever
oh i didn't realize that actually that
just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away
well that just seems to be a person who just doesn't care about much of anything around sort of you know doesn't sort of likes rights probably but doesn't like responsibilities
no i think
i mean that's what it what it boils down to is people like to you know people say well i don't want to be on jury you know i don't want to serve on jury duty i don't want to vote i don't want to do this and that well then they could you know i
put them in the reverse situation in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty and they don't have the right to vote i suspect their opinions would change very quickly
it turns out
that's right but it's the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if now the next election they have if only half of them are actually going to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in russia
right
now if things go the way that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but i think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of
only half of them will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement so
you know i think i think that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who are really out to make a statement because you know when
when you've got an underdog candidate who represents something and even if he doesn't win a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does i think make a statement to everyone else
i think that
yeah i think and i think that's real important
that's probably true
yeah
hum that's good that's actually real good
i said well the female who i would most rally behind right now right i don't know much about her politics that's about a way the way she makes speeches is a is a local person for you is ann richards
i don't know her politics i just know that i saw her speak in the eighty four democratic convention and right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president i would have slapped down my vote for ann richards
that that's very good that's i like that so i would i would i would vote for her without and i suspect she could get a large voter turnout
say i would think that people like that i think inflammatory politicians are or emotional politicians you know certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out i think
i would hope
um-hum
no oh i've heard of it but not necessarily i've heard it's very controversial though
um-hum
hum
yes
um-hum
that's what
um-hum
hum well they're elected as well so
so
so they're going to be
but
well in some sense they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you don't want them to have you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge
but on the other hand
right
that's right
um-hum
i've had one idea that i think is completely undoable but it but i think but i suspect it would work and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win
to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else
um-hum
that would be interesting yes i think that would work in some places yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
comes back in the yard so you don't have anyone do your yard you do it yourself yeah we do too
isn't that the truth all flyer's on every door everyday that's right well we my husband does the same thing he does the yard and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower but i keep putting off learning
that's right but i had recently gone out and planted mums so we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at calloway's
and put out yellow and bronze and they just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town and she says well those are gonna die just the first frost
i haven't gone out to check yet
oh listen but the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here i guess it was about four years ago and we did not know in august to put down the whatever it is for grub worms
and the next spring i guess in that march every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed we'd have big whole patches come up have you ever seen it
what grub worms do and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it would just come off in the rake down to the dirt so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares
and wet it and put it down and rope it off everything it took a lot of money and a lot of time so the most careful thing we do on our yard every august is put down that diazanon
oh yeah we found them
yeah we found them we dug under there about an inch and you could see them they're real fat old white things and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
yeah but in but in the um-hum
yeah june bugs is what i'd heard them called so anyhow occasionally i find them in the flower beds they said that every yard has some but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem
so that's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah i bet you did too and put those down in the spring
or the fall yeah because i started to say you can there's different times they say it's okay to do it
yeah
yeah keep it well my out here you know we don't have as many trees in plano at least the area where we're over by collin creek mall and but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died and all those
variegated things died so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly and they just live yeah you can you can stand those
um-hum
yeah
well it's kind of like one of these it's
same way um-hum that they warned me of that one finally and i said you know you need to either read neil sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery
yes and my backyard we had it really nice and then my husband wanted a labrador puppy and so it was about i guess he's three now so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my
bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio so it's like our backyard is just kind of like as long as he won't damage it fine and if he'll if there's anything he'll hurt we just don't put it out there anymore
um-hum very much very much
you did
huh
uh-huh
so do ours yeah
what did you grow
that is amazing
yeah
and i guess i'd fall in the same category that i don't think there should be any restrictions i think that if unless a weapon is self-propelled or has to be towed americans should be able to own it
uh-huh
um-hum
absolutely
i agree i think parents should be held responsible if their child gets a hold of one or either injures another person or themselves
i also am in favor of a check i think the criminal record system in the country should be brought up to snuff so that they can run a computer check as easy as they do when you run a credit card through so they can see if a person insane or is a felon
it wouldn't do any good right now because the criminal record systems are a mess you know i mean there really isn't any system as such but if there were and if the government were to invest in that then there wouldn't be any problem they'd
they'd be able to identify those that shouldn't have
well there isn't any computerized system that can tell you know
yeah i mean in virginia has done it by the way reason i i'm a life member of the gun owners and i am sure no member of the nra so i i'm kind of into this but virginia does have an instance check system
they do have their records within a state computerized and it seems to be working well
and if it could be done on a federal
the only state that i'm aware of
that's done that
well
yeah it really you know it's it should be done on a national basis because on the statewide basis you just get those that have violated state laws but
yeah and some there are federal you know violators too
so it would require an investment on the part of the government to bring their records up to shape but i think it's probably a good investment anyway
yes um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yes
um-hum
you know in that case in particular that fellow that did that had owned those guns a long time
so i mean it's not like he went in and picked them up and then went off on a shooting spree
and
that's right
unfortunately whenever something like that happens people tend to blame the gun and not the person it is it's it is the person
um-hum
but if it
um-hum but if there were a total ban you know who'd have the guns
it wouldn't be it wouldn't be the people who'd go to buy them honestly
right
that's right and gun control laws don't stem them because they don't they don't most of the criminals don't go buy their guns from a gun store anyway
they get them through the through the black market
well it's certainly a lengthy subject and there's a lot of
there's a lot of discussion about it and what and now and then it becomes a heated argument in both sides but
but i i've i just feel that the founders of our country the people that wrote the constitution didn't intend for us to not have a means to protect ourselves either from without the country or from within the country
no i don't i used to i used to now i'm just a target shooter yeah i used to go
um-hum
uh-huh
well that's a lot of it i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she won't quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system
where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera and then for some reason
taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form
causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what she's buying and then at the end of the of the period pay period
if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and it seems like the problem that we were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about
and those are the ones that will kill you know the accident the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month
um-hum
um-hum
but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldn't like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you
right
right
well that's true what we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely
and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month
and
yeah we're not there yet
um-hum
uh-huh
that's right that's right
um-hum same here yeah
well i could say it's kind of you know that's good you may you probably have a little extra than you have to have
to you know what i'm saying and so that that's the difference there where sometimes like i know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday
then i think if we could really budget we tried one i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years
we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener
so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're gonna spend going out for fun this is how much you're gonna spend it's kind of hard do you
yeah
oh how nice
uh-huh
i think so too
so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that that's excellent that's what i'm working toward i think you're probably much ahead of me there and i'm working on it
yeah
that came up yeah
uh-huh
well that's the best thing to do my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after so
rather frugal well that that's gonna payoff on retirement yeah well it i guess we've completed do you think we've been here ten
especially since the things that i think that our taxes are going for are i guess in my opinion not the necessarily appropriate things
i think that we should be emphasizing things like more like education and less on programs which are permanent black holes which will never
do anything but continue to be
sponges for money
i mean we need to do programs which are more on the concept of
well like one of the concepts they had before was trying to renovate the housing
but then turning the housing over that now see i agreed with that one and i'm not very often into those kind of those kind of programs but that one made sense
help these people to fix their houses to improve their environment i mean projects were the most idiotic concept in the world
you they had no sense of ownership no sense of responsibility
well it was like it's just a place for you to stay and you had no feeling of responsibility ownership concern in fact it was it was it was almost insulting it was it was so embarrassing
that i you know i don't know exactly what the motivations were but basically they were destroyed they were they you know people would strew feces across the
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
and it was all legal
yeah
right
other countries
um-hum
well if it's nothing okay
right
well i what it really comes down to the fact that
we don't have enough balls to actually make these programs work
part of the symptom of a democratic system is that it kind of freezes itself up
you very seldom able to do anything that's strong on either side whether it be left or right
i mean i mean sometimes i say you know even though i tend to go with the with the conservative line i sit there and i say you know at least if we did something
it would be better than what we do now
um-hum
right
yeah
oh yeah
i'll let you go first
um-hum
yeah i spent a couple years down in plano texas
and i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death for the plano school system
and the tax was administered by
payment every month and a tax payment every month
and the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was
getting as a resident of that particular county
and that's the way it worked here in maryland we have
a certain portion of your property taxes goes to education but also a portion of the state tax that you pay
goes back into the county that you live in
to pay for the educational system
and so it works out nice it makes it so that the
whole county now i know the concept of counties in texas is quite a bit different than it is here in maryland like collin county would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of baltimore county here in maryland
i mean the counties are much larger
you know in the whole state of maryland i believe there's only like fifteen counties
and so you know each county has their own school system an and it works out real nice
the flip side to this is are we getting what we're paying for and i don't believe so a lot of things have come to head recently and i heard a report because of
the emphasis that the president was putting on education
you know him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something
and then at the end of school year they would be tested and then they go into the fourth grade and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing so when they came up with these this nationwide system of public schools
they gave some figures out and since it's inception they've the price has gone up per the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty three percent
and so they're actually spending thirty three percent and that's real dollars you know that adjusting it back to the days you know when it started probably you know seventy years ago
and what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty three percent improvement in education
we've actually gone backwards
yeah
yeah well they they've been having some problems even here in like baltimore city which is a pretty good sized city
they've been putting a lot of stress on it and of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to you know do everything they're supposed to do and of course they've been cutting the teachers salaries because they say we don't have the money to do it and
all the services are costing more money and everything but the a lot of now is being put on you know when children used to be taught
you know like each child is individual you know they're not all the same
and
some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade and then all of a sudden everything clicks in you know and then there are some students that you know read well at five years old
and you know seem to excel and so that the you know one of the things i heard proposed on one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed
some kids
yeah
and
and on top of that they make the child feel inferior
because he's not as good as another kid his same age i mean it's like
you know that's ridiculous
yeah and you know i have i have five children total and i've got two out of the house already and i have two that are in eighth grade this year
and prior to their
when i when they were in elementary school they were identified as being slow
and so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade
and
it wasn't until the last two years last year my they're a set of twins a boy and a girl last year the boy twin started doing real well
and it everything started to click in for him and he knew what he needed to do and this year it happened for the daughter
she just has been
really doing great this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything and i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path i remember when i was in school i did horrible
up until about
yeah about the seventh eighth grade i started to come around and realize an and basically i got interested in math and never really did well in english but you know once you got interested in something
and things started to click in place
um-hum
yeah
jeez
yeah it is my children had a real culture shock when we lived in plano i guess i don't know if you've heard about the plano school district but they're they really stress academics there
and when we moved back to maryland i moved to a
and it's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point
and we lived you know in the northern part of the county we went from a
middle school in texas that served fifty five square blocks to a middle school in maryland that served fifty five square miles
and it was just a complete culture shock because i mean they they're riding on the bus in the morning with other kids that you know are a sleep because they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores and you know it's
had to learn how to drive a tractor
they actually had to take a driving test on the tractor i mean they just couldn't believe this and it was great they loved it
i mean they really enjoyed the courses
and it you know it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain a drain
but up here they seem to have made it a lot of fun for them and they seem to really enjoy it
it's kind of interesting because nearly thirty minutes ago i was reading an advertisement for the new infinity i forget what model number it was but one of the features they were touting was a freon free air conditioning system
yeah this is the first i'd seen of it too actually i was kind of i'm kind of surprised that
has become as much of an issue as it has because you know we know these things are designed to be closed systems either whether the problem's due to leaks or due to failures i would think that
yeah if it was designed with reasonable prudence stuff wouldn't get loose and i mean you don't want it to it's not cheap and the thing fails when it does
so i'm kind of surprised it became as much of an issue as it has
um-hum
yeah
so what do you what do you see as the other biggies being in that realm you know what else could be something that is a bad thing
yeah i traded cars recently and went from a car that got seventeen miles per gallon
of worth of on premium and didn't really wasn't happy with premium wasn't high enough
to a car that gets about twenty four miles per gallon on the cheapest garbage you can put in it
so i probably contributed my share there and kind of interesting course there is talk about legislation that would ban
the manufacture of an engine that required leaded fuel at some point and
this i believe has i read has put the general aviation world going nuts because
a general aviation engine can cost in the neighborhood of thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars to overhaul and if it flies a hundred hours a year
that's moderately high so the amount of dollars spent per unit of pollution saved
are very tiny as compared to a car where it's a relatively inexpensive engine and it's running for a lot longer per year
so it's a question of now apparently the epa thought about this again and decided that
these that general aviation engines won't count
and they'll allow them to continue to burn leaded fuels but there's some concern over if this is the only market is anybody gonna wanna bother making leaded fuels
it's an old joke about the finest congressman money can buy
sounds like another issue
you know i've always viewed it as the pollution issue as a property rights issue if somebody dumped their garbage in your front lawn
regularly
you'd have legal recourse but if he dumps it into the air surrounding your house you really don't have any
and i think therein lies a big part of the problem is that it's viewed a little differently from physical pollution
i kept a monthly budget for so long i don't have one now but i sort of know where it is i know where my expenses are and how much i have to cover them how about you
uh-huh
yeah
do you
yes
i keep hearing that we're supposed to pay ourselves first and set aside our savings first are you are you able to do that
back when we were i'm i take it you may be past raising a family is that true
that back in those other days we couldn't do that could we
like doctor bills and things like that
are you planning ahead for retirement through your savings and things
yes
um-hum
um-hum
he keeps saying well we need to sit and find out how much we want and i think that's true but like you said it's hard to do
one of the things that we've done towards that is buy nursing home insurance
have you all thought of that
um-hum
um-hum
oh that's sounds
that sounds good
um-hum
um-hum
i know mine i'm we've gone through some mergers and my retirement has
so
no because of the changes that came about in the government requirements and then in merger requirements
but you have to be so careful of what it will pay and what it won't pay
oh no it's an insurance policy
um-hum
it pays a set amount
and
and you talk to your insurance agent about there's special companies now that are doing it
and they set them up i know ours is a set amount each year and it has a maximum amount over a thirty month period
and it you know it has you need to read the policy and look into what it covers
i guess i'm conscious of that because my mother's in a nursing home
and i think we learn from our experiences
yeah it does
but
i think one of the main things that we in the past always talked about was not having any major expenses to budget for when we do retire
oh yes
oh yes
you know
it would sounds like we do
and you're leaning more towards investments and things like that to do yours then
well we do that too
you know you can't then the insurance policies are just things to kind of buffer in case of unexpected things
oh yes but
the investments are something that you have to plan for and get your
well guess it's logical to ask do you exercise any
i'm about the same way i do a little bit my job kind of hinders me from
exercising i'm a night operator here at a
industry down here and i don't really get out a lot during
because of my job to exercise
right
it is
um-hum that's the way i feel i'm used to being in pretty good shape because when i was in high school i stayed in pretty good shape playing a little basketball and stuff like that but i've gotten now i'm in college and i go to school during the day and work at night
i can tell that i've not really done a whole lot
well i usually i'm i usually play at home we live out in the country so me and my brother'll play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play or a lot of times we're up at the church we'll play volleyball
stuff like that
oh really
oh the sweating to the oldies
right
oh really
right that's the way i am i just want to sit down and relax too tired to exercise
i did i started riding my bike about a couple of months ago and i'd ride about two or three miles a day but it'd last about a couple of weeks and it got real cold for a little while so i gave it up
walk around
right
right i've noticed people doing that down here too i'll be in town or something and people will walk around the mall
it is it's fairly safe
uh-huh
right
right i used to do a lot of swimming we have a swimming pool and but it's an old concrete pool we've been having trouble with it the past few years
so we haven't got to use it much but i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that
right
right you can't do it year round
right that's the way ours is
just in the summertime
no
i'm from laurel
yes ma'am it started about yesterday i believe it started raining and got real cold
oh
right
okay what do you think of the public school system first off do you have children that are in it
oh okay well then you should be a good one to know because i my children are grown now i now have grandchildren in the school system so
i don't have first had experience right now with it so what do you think
right
correct
yes it is i agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because
our grandchildren we have a fourth grader and then we have one that's in kindergartner and i know the fourth grader
is doing stuff that our children was doing were doing in the fifth and sixth grade
you know it's amazing to me and stuff that i didn't do until i was in junior high which of course shows my age
right
now
yes
i have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms
and are you do you find that
uh-huh
um-hum
be um-hum
uh-huh well i know that this again this friend is in the plano school district and she teaches
it emotionally disturbed children and she says she has some six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade
and she says she's getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them on even though they're not ready but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money
when they're passed on or something i didn't quite understand it
and
very good discussion or on child care
they're all grown up
oh well you know all about it then
it's been quite a few years i have grandchildren but haven't really been into selecting child care for them so and it's been quite a few years since i've had to think about that
no my daughter that has three stays home with her children and one my daughters has one but an aunt keeps the baby
but i would i would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays but i would imagine it's very hard
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
oh well that's good
i've always thought you know it would be really tough what if you had a fire or something with babies
you would have to be able to have enough you know you'd have to be able to get them all out
uh-huh
oh well that's a
i hadn't thought about that but i was thinking oh my gosh if they had very many babies they couldn't possibly get them all out
but you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out i guess
oh well that's neat
well do most of your day care workers really care about the children or is it just a job for them
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hm yeah how old a group how old the children go with this center where you work
um-hum
um-hum
you've got the little bitty ones those are the probably the best group to have
and they're fun
babies are fun and they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet so
um-hum
um-hum do you think there's very many really good day care centers around your area
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
sometimes it's a have to
i hear a lot of the girls i work with constantly oh i wish i could find someplace i really felt good about you know
most of them don't really feel that it's a great place to leave their kids
and it's really bad you know one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place and then they called her one afternoon and said well we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here
lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today and we just now found her
they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon
and so immediately she says well i can't have any confidence in them anymore if they'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they're one short
but one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus and this was four hours later you know
so she has switched to a different center now and
i have to agree with you there i think that for once we should we shouldn't even be at these mideast talks because with the exception of our hostages we really don't have
to much of a real we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding who's land it is just let these people fight it out
you know we've got so many domestic problems and what does it cost to keep these people over there you know
oh so how about the soviet union what do you think's gonna happen there the break ups
um-hum
that's right that's right
international is important but i mean we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed
you know and then there's the homeless issue and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without
hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations i think and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending
right
exactly
i know it
right
that's right you're either liberal or you're conservative
well i think
it wouldn't hurt and i know the independent party's been trying for years to get a real force in the in congress but you're right there's just too many
issues that come up that our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a democratic issue or it's a republican issue and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel
i think we might have a lot better a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed
he's one he's one of the two huh
well let's see senators are in for six years right and when did you guys vote him into office
oh you're stuck
what experience have you had with family reunions
uh-huh
huh that's really good
yeah my mom my mom's family is all
my family is really scattered out so if we didn't have family reunions we simply would never see each other for example
my parents live in seattle washington
however all of my mom's and relatives and family are from utah
and all of my dad's relatives and family are from oregon so we usually have family reunions once a year and we'll go to utah and
my mom puts a big deal into the family reunion when they go to utah and
she sometimes plans them and sometimes helps in planning them usually southern utah is so hot that we pick there's the
they rent out this cabin that's up on a mountain i mean you have to go up into the hills to get the cooler temperatures and have a enjoyable time
and that's what we usually do and then have of course the food is one of the highlights also
yeah
yeah i know at the family reunions on my dad's side that we go to in oregon we usually
have it at a park and so you know swimming is always part of one of the activities so
oh there's a there's a family reunion once a year
for each for my father's side and for my mother's side i know and my wife also
each family does something
yeah
yeah my grandma also has some
we haven't particularly shown those at the reunions but my grandma has some home movies and we ever whenever we go to her house we like to
see those are
you know nice for memories
uh-huh
uh-huh
do you have any personal experience involving child care services
right
uh-huh
i have a friend at work yeah whose wife does that she takes in kids i think they're regulated by the state as to how many they can take in at one time
so i'm not sure how anybody checks up on that but i think there's a maximum number of kids that they can take care of at any one time
yeah
do you think it ought to be subsidized by the company
something you can sign up for and pay
sure
right no i don't think that the company should be subsidizing services like that
sure
yeah i think that would take care of any questions about competency for people running the show
i think that's a big question
yeah uh-huh
yeah
there are some services that
that are very expensive for typically subsidized by large companies for some of their important employees
where if they can't get there regular sitter or a child care service to take there kids if they reserve slots with these other companies very expensive rates but they can drop their kid off at one of these places for
so it i don't know what it cost but it's extremely expensive and the companies have to reserve x number of slots per year they can't send anymore it's pretty much for their
for their some of their employees lawyers do that a lot i've heard about this type of service in places like new york city where people are real busy but if
if they can't find the regular sitter they if the company has slots available in this service these employees can drop their kids off there
yeah
great
uh-huh do you have any idea what the regular services cost like la petite or kinder care
uh-huh
yeah
yeah pretty much so but other than that i know some also who's claim that after they have their kids or started having kids they're going to quit their job and dedicate their time to raising the kids right
according in putting it in their words
and staying at home so i don't know i guess each way has it's advantages
uh-huh
uh-huh
well a few i guess
oh my goodness i can't you tell me first because i can't think right now
you mean you had the same topic twice
hum
oh now that was great we saw that too
it's the first time i've seen him do a comedy almost type show
which is kind of a change for arnold schwarzenegger
yeah now that was a good show my wife and i enjoyed that a lot i think the kids did too we didn't go together though
and then mom and dad went to see it when it went to the dollar and a half movie house
they used to be a dollar here but it finally went up
yeah
oh yeah it was good show really was we went to see the king i think it's the king mary jo and i did
that's the one that oh i forget the guy's name that stars with roseanne on tv
oh what's that yeah goodman and that was funny now that was really a good show
i mean it wasn't a great show it's just a b movie but it was fun i think i think you and your wife would enjoy that it's pretty light hearted humor and it was it was kind of neat kind of cute
oh it was definitely worth that it was worth couple of bucks just to get out and watch that and it was upbeat movie and everything else
and you know eat the popcorn and all that
that's where they make the money is on the popcorn anyway they charge ridiculous prices they charge more for the popcorn than they do for the movie
yeah i think it's called the king or something like that it's john goodman i think it's you know and he's the main star in the whole movie
and it's funny it really is
you know we rather enjoyed trying to think of a couple of others that we went to see that we went to see one movie i can't remember the name of it now though but it was
oh what was it i can't remember it's just terrible
anyway i long time back for the benefit at least of the subject we're discussing i went to see die hard two i guess it was die harder
and that was a scream and you know i thought that was pretty good and
i don't know i can't think of another one other than that at the moment how about you
uh-huh
um-hum
so she can't really enjoy it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
stallone just did a comedy incidentally that i think's out now
yeah
yeah i'm kind of looking forward that my wife says there's one she wants me to take her to see this weekend
and i'm trying it's about a it it's one that was done a long time ago i think tony curtis
was the star in where the guy dies falls overboard or something and comes back as a woman
and there's a movie coming out gosh what's the name of that
it's already out matter of fact it's been advertised on tv about a guy that falls he gets killed somehow or another and he comes back as a woman
and you talk about funny at least the little snapshot previews that they've shown on tv advertising it are hilarious i mean it is really funny
and so we're going to go see that
now we saw a movie called sisters
what's that may have been almost a year ago now i think about it
that was quite good
i don't know if you've
let's see i don't remember whether cheers no i don't think so you mean christie
no i don't think she was in this one i was trying to remember exactly who the characters were
but it was a real touching show about three sisters
no this was a real sort of serious piece it had some light moments but basically it was a serious piece
i thought it was just called sisters or something like that or the sisters or the three sisters or something
i can't really quite remember and then we saw one some time back it's a shame i can't remember the titles of these for the benefit of this conversation although it may not be that the necessarily the
intent but nevertheless that we saw one here a while back that dolly parton and several ladies starred in
three or four or five three or four women together
yeah and
yeah that was pretty good it was okay you know most of this stuff is b movies anyway
no i haven't
have you seen that
was it really good i have heard all kinds of mixed things about it
are you
psychologist something right um-hum
uh-huh
oh yeah that's right i think it was a take off from true story you're right
yeah who was the guy he rehabilitated he starred in taxi or not taxi
yeah oh yeah it was robert deniro right
did he
well did you ever see speaking of medical oriented movie or at least a movie about somebody got rehabilitated did you ever see the one that dustin hoffman starred in
yeah now wasn't that a good show
i really enjoyed it
oh man i enjoyed that show
my wife and i both enjoyed that
uh-huh huh
uh-huh
oh i see that's good
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
rain man
yeah
right yeah that was one that we really enjoyed i was trying to think of
oh what was that one though
yeah
oh how about any older shows like john wayne movies and things like you got any favorites along those lines
yeah me too
oh yeah
i like almost everything he yeah i really love rue grit
and yeah oh man they i thought they were really fun they were interesting and the one he did with his boys jake big jake
i've seen that on tv several times and that was a lot of fun movie you know i have kind of favorite because i like the musical scores to it matter of fact i had to hunt for years to finally find a copy of the record
because they made so few of them it wasn't really wasn't all that popular and that was not was it hogan's heroes or
kelly's heroes kelly heroes name of the show the one that clint eastwood stars in and carroll o'connor
now that's one of my favorite shows i really enjoy i've been trying to tape that one for years and haven't succeeded in doing so yet
but i finally did find an album i had to look around several different dealers here in the maryland area
and put the word out to find the album that had the movie score on it that you know they open the show with
a movie with a score to that
and then they wind up at the end playing a tune that is just one of my favorites i've loved it for years and i'm sitting here as i tell you this trying to think of the name of it
the kelly's heroes the movie
yeah i remember that
their on there way into germany they make up their own little army you might say they start out small but they get bigger and bigger all the time they bribe this guy well little bribe he's willing to go in on it they've got three tanks that have these huge pipes he puts on the turrets to make
and what
that's right and i bet you like to ski with your kids
oh it's been raining here all day but
oh
oh
jeez i don't know oh i don't know there's got to be thousands
oh good yes
oh good yes
i've been wondering about that
i know i know and we'll i need to give you that number too but that's one thing we should do pray with our kids right
uh-huh
oh
oh
oh
oh jeez
yeah us yes oh
um-hum
yeah tennis
orchestra yes
we haven't played yet this year but we you know the park and rec center that's right beside us you know it doesn't cost you anything if the court isn't reserved you can play for free
oh no he hasn't had time
yeah
they're putting in a new dialogue system at the university and so he's been working nights and you know he's been really busy
but
oh i know
well this is a good stepping stone for him
yeah so we're real proud of him
what test
oh whoa
oh
oh that's wonderful
oh see
now we've i work with a spreadsheet at work i do bank recs on it yeah they are neat they're scary at first but they are neat and you need to be teaching your kids that stuff because it'll really help them
uh-huh
oh
oh that's wonderful
that's wonderful
oh good
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's great did he bring the card his card
oh jeez
okay
dc around here stands for drug capital or death capital
and they're starting to get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
only a couple of not a whole large group of them but just a few most of them centered around drug territory
crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up
yeah that's the latest thing that way there's no damage to the car or anything they just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want
it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here we're from i'm from ohio and my wife's from florida so
right and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school and of course the mayor of dc is having a real problem
trying to what do you do to reduce crime in a in a major city like dc where it's a way of life for everybody it's
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right and they see all their friends and neighbors
yeah and their friends are driving mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and i think to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because
this is the way they were raised
it's the law that's got to be changed instead of their way of life so i don't know it's
uh-huh
right they've always been with us
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
all right well that's an interesting topic
yeah i've got three small children
yeah
well i basic feeling is that everybody performs some sort of public service no matter what career path they take unless they are just absolute dropouts
and part of my reaction is that some people particularly those that are gifted and talented
and highly motivated ought to get on with their lives and do the thing that they do best
you know if somebody wants to become a doctor or a dedicated professional and they're serious about it
i hate to see their lives put on hold for a year or two while they do something that's not down their alley
yeah
um-hum
um-hum well i think i hate to see things mandated for people because i like to see people have their choice freedom of choice let's not get into that subject
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah i think one of the reactions i had was when i graduated from college i was all set to go into military service and do my part
and when it the end of my four years and i got my degree and i started talking to some of the recruiters for different companies
and one of them sat me down and he said hey you know what are you going to do in two years in the military where are you going to go and what's going to happen to you
and they persuaded me that i could serve my country better by going to work for one of the military industrial companies in direct support of military operations
and so that's where i've been ever since and so i don't regret not going into military service
yeah but
yeah
yeah
and everybody has there soapbox i have a lot of people come around to the house trying to solicit funds for some environmental action or preserve some form of wildlife
and i turn them down because i choose to contribute directly in terms of energy and i've been involved in research diving on several occasions to
gain information about the environment and it contributes to the body of knowledge so i'd rather put my money in that form directly and i think a lot of people do things like that
they have their own applications that get them involved in the public
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah well i think an awful lot is available at the present time i have a niece who's with me for the summer
and she had done volunteer work for the sierra club
in years past
and she currently has a summer job with them so she's
she's getting paid for what she used to do as a volunteer but she's getting more actively involved with the sierra club
but that's the thing that she wants to do
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
the last time i went camping was about in the middle of october
and we went up to lake bonham and really enjoyed it had a real good time with the family we do an awful lot of camping
how about yourself
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes oh
very good i bet it's pretty over there
what do you think what kind of camping are you talking about do you go out and is camping for you in a motor home or a trailer or do you actually put up a tent the whole bit
oh okay so you have yeah
a pop up trailer huh how fun we have a tent
and we really enjoy that one thing i've done all sorts of camping i've camped
in the snow on a glacier i've camped
basically almost anywhere even to a point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in
was what you had to use to sustain you for that camping trip and had to pack it back out
we really enjoy it but also while i was growing up we did have a trailer and i've camped in a trailer and in a tent and in log cabins and so forth too so
a lot of different things and yes i to answer your questions earlier yes i we do enjoy fishing and i do go fishing haven't done a whole lot down here we recently moved from
the rocky mountain area up in northern utah down to here because of work and haven't been able to
enjoy fishing like i used to up there which is clear water fishing and streams and rivers
we normally yeah we did we did a lot of fishing but mainly what we did is we did a lot of hiking and exploring and just going out and seeing what there was to see in the area
oh yes that's true that's true and
personally i when i when we were growing up and when we were going camping i thought that was little too structured of a camp ground
you know that was mainly for people in motor homes or
or had trailers or and so on and so forth where you know we really wanted to go camping in a tent and koa is geared for the people that have a hook up
right exactly
and
i started out basically camping when i was when i was in boy scouts and we did an awful lot of that as a boy scout group as i mentioned earlier
we went into wilderness areas and we camped in the snow in snow caves and
and
all right and you got a lot of that in huh
what do you like to do when you go camping
um-hum
tell scaries or scary stories around the fire and so on
actually we really enjoy getting away from the television the telephone
and yes exactly get out getting out and enjoying nature and each company when we're out camping
running water and a and a private bathroom and
yes they really do they have a great time and like i mentioned the we've been camping a couple of times this year and the last time was in october and we went up to lake bonham
and there is a playground for them and so they have swings and they have
uh-huh well we have cable but we only have cinemax and i think our favorite night is monday night and we start out with evening shade
and major dad and i think that's the one night that we really try to watch television you know my husband's always got it on i'm not always sitting down at it
yes i just i love that all those that two hours and now tonight i just finished up with that a woman called jackie did you watch did you watch it
and i like those and we very seldom watch any public television channel thirteen do you watch it much
yes
yes it is now we haven't watched any of those
yes now we have watched some things on that
that male syndrome of flicking that channel thing you know and he's flipping around there and
but our grandchildren like that discovery channel if they're over here because lots of times they will have things on animals and they just thoroughly
you know enjoy that in fact i think they were watching something on
and you know i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else you know with him and but other
yes
yes and sometimes now we're getting that the other football where they play it
it was a it was car races some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down i don't know what channel he found that on
and but he will turn that on especially for if again if our oldest grandson is over here he's ten and they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it i you know
and so and sundays we usually have all of our kids are over on sunday so you know we don't get into that except that sometimes we'll get into the home videos
do you ever watch that
yeah um-hum
kate what kind of where do you like to eat out
yes
do you have you tried mother mesquite's
that's at skillman and lbj there is it's where skillman curves into forest lane and it's real good mexican food a another real good one is
raphael's down on mckinney avenue
they're both very good um-hum
chains uh-huh
oh el chico's or el phoenix one um-hum well i like tia's better than i do el chico's or el phoenix
much better mother mesquite's is one of our favorites but then fajitas are one of my
uh-huh
yes now i haven't eaten there have you eaten there
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i we like for the cajun the spicy we like atchafalaya's out on beltline in addison and it's a good restaurant
the service is great they have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want and the
the atmosphere is wonderful too if you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go
fast food oh i can understand that i can remember when our children were small we lived in the chicago area at the time and we had a lot of mcdonald's when they were first coming out i can't look a mcdonald in the face now
i know
yes sounds like my grandchildren
oh yes
oh no
i like breakfast out
i like the ihop there in plano
oh really oh now that's surprising
because normally they're just they're real good and i like because they they're even if they're crowded they're fast service you know i don't have to wait forever for a table
and we also like owens
country yeah we think it's good
um-hum it's good
yes and we like applebee's
yeah it it's fun i like your up there in plano that country steak house
have you tried it
we like it because it's fairly reasonable and they have we go for the salad bar
uh-huh
do you read for work or something
huh are you in the scientific field or something
ah
well my thoughts about magazines are that they're kind of a quick fix i watch very little tv and i like to read a lot
but if i'm feeling jumpy i kind of enjoy a magazine because everything's short
and you can you know lay perhaps look at the pictures read an article for a couple of pages you don't feel like you've committed yourself to all the time it takes to read five hundred pages
oh yeah your pretty thorough if you're going to it right
oh if you're in a doctor's office and they have all kinds of stuff what are you attracted to
well in the magazine world i guess i'm kind of
i hate to stereotype myself because i'm not all that girlish in the sense of girlish you know i can solder and all of that kind of good stuff
but in my magazines when i think about it i have a cooking magazine i like because i like to cook and there's some this thing called country home which has
it's kind of a mellow thing with all kinds of american and
you i don't know recipes and decorating and all kinds of girl stuff
well the other day i was talking with a fellow about woodworking and that's another thing i love to do
i'm an artist and i'm into all kinds of crafts and things so i can i can saw and solder and all kinds of
you know things that would make me not sound like the typical you know cutesy
but i guess in magazines i you know i run the line i suppose that's true
at we have some road and track magazines around the house my oldest son likes and i'll pick that up too
i enjoy it i like to look at the stuff i'd love to have if i had all the money to buy it
it's kind of like sneaking a peek at the other side i know -at you mean
i'm a big fan of the library i you know i don't really reread books so
with the price of the paperbacks and even the hardcovers going up i just why not use the library they'll even get anything you ask them to find for you so you know why not do that but i am a big fan of the new book rack you walk in
and they've got all the new books and to me it's like a little treasure opening this crispy you know covered brand new book and i'll come home with the strangest things that i'd never would have picked out
because you know they run through the whole dewey decimal system and you know there was one on alpine skiing that looked interesting and one on you know wood carving that looked interesting and you know you just find these things that
-ll it's refreshing to pick up something that you would never go to a rack for i think
i don't know that i have that much more to say about wood about wood carving i'm not even speaking thinking straight here about magazines
any other thoughts on your part
yeah
there are some i'm particularly interested in the crafts and there is one called american craft that lists all the shows and that kind of thing and
craft shows are a lot of fun to go to when it's not some
then i really enjoy it and i'm going to start taking up some pottery which i've never done myself i've gone from woodworking to silver jewelry making to stain glass
so jan how do they recycle in texas
um-hum
uh-huh yeah
yeah
is it is it all voluntary
right
um-hum
yeah um-hum
right yeah
there's a lot of projects where the boy scouts and things and that will collect your cans and it's a good fund raiser for the kids
um-hum
i guess i you see i guess it depends on your landfill space
i know i we're in maryland but my i from pennsylvania and my parents how are forced recycling
yeah all plastic they all plastic has to go into a recycling bin all cans have to be recycled all newspapers have to be recycled
because they're just running out of space and landfills pennsylvania ohio and new york are some of the they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones
so it's really it's really hard on them now up here in maryland though we're just in a voluntary recycling stage right now so
so my wife and i you know we save our bottles and we save our newspapers and we save all of our plastic and all of our tin cans and just like you say we go to a community area where they have it set up and we dump them off there
yeah it's still voluntary
though i think i think we're supposed to have something impeme implemented by nineteen ninety three though
where some aspects will be mandatory um-hum
mostly just the cans
and i and most of the time like i said that's a sort of like fund raiser things that the schools do or that the boy scouts do or whatever
yeah
um-hum cans are the only thing i think you really get money for
um-hum
right um-hum
yeah and i think that's mostly well you know we even before as soon as the community said you know we're going to put up bins for recycling you know we automatically
started doing it was it's one of those things you know and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be separated you know that's
no hum-um
um-hum
yeah
um-hum yeah
right
yeah
how much how well they're doing yeah we do i work in a speech interface lab at a at a at a college
and we do basically the same thing the state of maryland has lost asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations you know if they would definitely recycle their office paper
and the same thing you know every almost every college in maryland is recycling office paper but you know in the giant bins around and it's surprising how much
you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage can every night
you don't notice until you start leaving yeah they don't pick up your recycling until it's full and you just can't believe how much paper that you
reams of paper come out of an office every day they just asked me to recycle
um-hum
right
yeah so i think hopefully if you know i guess a lot of the large organizations probably ti did they advertise on television how successful they are
some
yeah
yeah
um-hum
internal
um-hum
yeah
right yeah that would probably be true
um-hum
yeah because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television you know they'll come up and say you know they'll show you they'll to encourage to encourage recycling
they'll say and here those of us at dalmarva power which is our power company you know we now recycle forty five percent of our solid waste and they
and we do this for the community they put those on so i so i think you know we're probably reaching a successful stage and just with voluntary i think
um-hum
right yeah
yeah i think so too yeah
right yeah we weren't concerned yeah that's true
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i think really probably what hit people's you know i know that here in the up in the
the new england area and also in pennsylvania ohio and new york the just run all of a sudden we're out of landfill
and then they're saying we estimate this landfill will be will be full in two years unless we cut back
and even then you know we're really running out of space so i think that became that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space in some of the more crowded states
so what you know and no other state i'm sure texas probably still has some landfill space they're not going to voluntarily say hey ship your garbage here
so you know realistically you know we really had to start we have to start recycling in some geographic areas it's really tough
um-hum
um-hum
right yeah though well
well in some ways i guess it doesn't become really cost savings until you have an industry around it you know because i know that like in pennsylvania
they require them to put their newspaper for recycling but
the deinking process that they have to they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused
is very expensive and also it produces a waste a liquid waste that they don't know what to do with yet
so even some aspects of recycling
still have cost yeah cost efficient yet yeah
so but others you know like tin cans and plastics are really efficient you know they melt on quickly and can be you know just because of the heating and things yeah and glass yeah
so it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
the water table you know they really pollute quickly and
you know one i was what reading some place the brake fluid you put brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers
that one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water you know like hundreds of gallons of water
so it's one of those things that they really and you wonder you know with all these oil spills
how terrible that is yeah how terrible that is so we'll have to we'll have to keep our eyes on all that i guess
um-hum
yeah i agree
um-hum
i do too
um-hum
yeah it
well you know if they're forced to do it becomes sort of a habit
you know i know that it's really funny my parents are forced to do it and they
what do you think about it
yeah
yeah i especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else you know harm or injury absolutely
and i don't have a problem at all with employers testing in the hiring process
but i don't
i don't have a problem with them too much testing even after the fact but i do a little bit where it where it wouldn't hurt anybody
i don't know sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far
but
yeah
right and then it's not a problem
yeah
oh absolutely
oh yeah
the train drivers
yeah
i wish they would
i wish they would and that i think is even probably more widely abused by you know the masses than drugs so to speak
so
oh i know it
and
no
just
yeah and
now ti has the random testing policy and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool
you know so i've already been tested once when i was hired and once since they initiated this random testing program
but i work with one girl who was tested her name got randomly selected three times in six months
yeah
right
yeah
you were just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it
oh absolutely
there are so many people with their petty axes to grind it could really get out of hand and
yeah
to report it and i guess you'd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something
because i would feel very uncomfortable working with someone i knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol i'd just i'd feel really uncomfortable
yeah we have we have a lot of people who work on the line i'm in accounting so it wouldn't you know they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something but out on the line they've got people working some serious equipment
so
put at risk i agree totally
i was trying to remember there was a court case
here where i live just a few months ago the city workers they wanted to the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing
and the city workers took them to court
to protest saying that it invaded their i guess first the search and seizure amendment
and it's still tied up in the legal channels they haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not
so i'm curious especially since ti a local you know employer is also already doing it seeing what they'll say about it especially since
well it's the whole it's the whole city
seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it
yeah so
yeah
uh-huh
right
whether they're really concerned about their rights or whether they're really concerned about something else
i don't believe that
uh-huh
now is he the elementary school
uh-huh
uh-huh but he is being helped
uh-huh
oh great
oh
i think i read about that in the paper doctor haggard is
is heading that up
uh-huh
oh
right so you worked you learned how to solve your problems your on your own
has he had this since kindergarten or is this something that maybe learning phonetics and then he just didn't learn the right way
uh-huh
okay
you're right
right
good that's great for parents to be involved
oh how great
so she was able to zero in oh
huh
uh-huh
right
oh no
right but that's something that parents i think are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child
so because that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home
but learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that
then it makes it real difficult and this is this to me is the benefit i see in public schools is that you do have government money to fund the kinds of programs
that these students need and i'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem they test kids before they take them
and if they're a behavior problem they're out that and
this is a kind of a rejection type of thing and we get it even at our level in i work a nine ten school
and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the parochial and private schools
so i really hate that for them i would rather they not have that attitude but
that's
right
that's right
uh-huh
no
that's right they can be selective right
right
if you choose the select
top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the to the private school group then i think you would have a more equitable
way and i have a problem when they compare the kids in japan or germany to the kids here in honesty the kids in japan are they have to try out to even get into to which kindergarten they're going to get into
and then after and if you only the in fact they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide
because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and high school and if they don't then when they reach a certain age they just that's the end of their schooling
and they don't ever really go on it's only their top ones that go on like ours do
and so that creates a problem and you can't compare because they go so many more hours
the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education and is that child
that's right
that's right that's right
better coping skills yes
right
right
well and you don't you don't see the parents encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or drill teams or band
it's strictly stick to the educational and it's interesting to see them as they get older then that is the type of adult they are
hello
okay i pressed one so i guess we're recording now
okay
okay well i've i have had some because i was working for p i e and they went bankrupt so
i've got quite a bit of spare time right now but i've been making dolls cloth dolls
um-hum
and
yeah it's a they're all cloth it's not any porcelain at all
yeah and i make the clothes for them
and
no you can get the little curly hair at the craft shop
i made some of them with that hair and then
don't ask me what the other hair i made it look like
it looked i made some of them with regular wigs
i went to the flea markets and bought you know like the wigs for a dollar
then i cut a v shape out of the back of them
and then sewed them on
i have sold five of them so far
um-hum i just have to get a place where you know i can sell them actually
duh
if i would just work all day long making the clothes and everything probably about two and a half days
um-hum
yes i really do and then i also crochet
and
yeah
yeah i tried knitting first but i don't know i didn't like it so then i went to crocheting but now i wanna learn how to knit again
you know
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah i'd in fact i just bought a serger in december
yeah
i haven't done everything on it yet you know but just what little bit i have used it for i really like it
you know especially making the seams and things like that you know it's
it's got such a professional finish on them
yeah
so i like that
and
so i just make clothes for my dolls
just
you know just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and
try to make a doll
and they it turned out really cute yeah you got to have a pattern for the body you know
and
yes
aren't they cute
um-hum
um-hum no i bought a bunny pattern one time but when i sewed it up the face of it looked like a mouse
um-hum
it was too pointed
so i tore it back apart again and i haven't tried another one
no but i bought a little lamb pattern
and the material and everything to make it out of but i haven't made it yet
no i don't paint except i stenciled my wall
um-hum
oh really
oh yeah i
my neighbor did it first and i seen her house and i saw how beautiful it looked so then i decided well i was gonna do it
and it turned out really good
mostly flowers
you know
i've done it in all my rooms
i've put it in the bedrooms in the bathroom
i don't like the idea of you know anyone being able to just sort of go up to a store and buy a hand gun for about you know forty dollars or whatever and go out and shoot someone
but i also think that hunting is a legitimate use for weapons and i also sort of believe that
something ever happened and our government was run by someone who decided to make it non democratic well that's a very farfetched and you know sort of
you know paranoid if you will possibility but you know it i guess it's
i think it's always sort of a bad idea when the only people that have guns are the military and the police since
yeah i mean i
yeah i agree completely there should be a waiting period and they should be able to do a background check on you
yeah i mean most
yeah i agree completely
yeah
yeah that's a reasonable
yeah i don't think so
you need a permit to carry a concealed handgun i think in some states i think texas might be one of those but to just carry you know one in the open or whatever is no problem
yeah although i one thing is i think no matter what rules you set unless you sort of had good enforcement of it wouldn't matter i mean the types of people that cause trouble with handguns aren't the sort to care what the law is anyway
and i'm sure they would certainly attempt to buy them on the black market so you'd need you know a good method of ensuring that they weren't available there which
given the success or rather lack there of the police in controlling the market in drugs i sort of wonder you know really how effective it would be but i don't i don't mean that
yeah
yeah i mean i don't mean it as an argument to not have waiting periods and that sort of thing but i just you know i just i think it's
something to be aware of that it probably would not be the ultimate solution that would solve all crime problems
yeah
do you do you have any sort of
you know real life experience with you know either people owning guns or people being you know assaulted with guns or anything like that
yeah
yeah
yeah my dad hunted when he was young although he didn't
by the time i came along so we didn't have guns in our house he left them at his parents house so you know i got to see them or whatever
but i do another student who i didn't know personally
you know robbers said you know i guess he was on a motorcycle and he had a his motorcycle helmet on which saved his life because
they said you know we want your money you know we have gun or whatever so he was like okay here have my money you know i'll lie on the ground i'll do whatever you say i'll i'm not going to put up any fight whatsoever
and apparently there were two guys and one of them was really kind of jumpy and the other seemed kind of relaxed so he said to the relaxed guy hey you know please tell your friend not to shoot me you know but apparently the other guy for whatever reason shot him anyway
and
thanks to the fact his motorcycle helmet was made out of kevlar which is the same thing that bullet proof vest are made out of and so you know he was shot in the head but he was unharmed you know i mean i think i think he might've gone to the hospital anyway just to you know be looked at but
he didn't even have a concussion or anything like that
but
so it's kind of scary
living at houston's got a lot of crime
okay jerry i guess tonight's topic is about personal computers and level of interest and your expertise
okay
well first of all you want me to start off
okay real fine first of all yes i do own a pc here at home and i also have one at the office
and my level of interest is quite high with pcs and i was really i am really interested in them however not to the extent as i was about two years ago when i
basically knew about everything there was to know about different things and that was the time when we were shopping for one
and i think we got a top of the line at that time but as you know pcs change quite rapidly
and the technological advances kind of outdated our pc where i can get the same pc i got two years ago at the fraction of the cost
and i also enjoy using ours at home and we used it for a number of different things
plus i get in a lot an awful lot of good use of the one at work where i work lot of analytical testing reviews
lot of different things i use it at work so i enjoy pcs and they make my life and my work a lot easier how about yourself
um-hum
wow all right
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh yes
oh yes
yes
oh wow well
well that's great
uh-huh
right
great
we do an awful lot of that too with ours
oh yes definitely agree with that
uh-huh
yes
wow
yes
yes has to you have to have that to support unix
um-hum of ram
yes
wow okay
you say she's a programmer also
uh-huh well great well she probably needs that kind of a powerful machine to do her work
repair parts for cars or something
huh
nope
no lemons huh
well that's good
oh that's good
well it's been difficult i don't know i haven't really returned anything because there's a lot of
actually i have tried to get it fixed for example i've had a
i guess a vcr
and
it was brand new
and pretty top of the line type of vcr and i had problems with it recording things
it would it was strange you can fast forward play through it and you'd see this picture on there
but if you played it normal it would go in and out between blue program screen and the actual
thing that was being recorded it was very bizarre
and the maintenance said it was due to weak signals
i'm saying well you know i'm paying this a lot of money for this
vcr and you're telling me just because it hasn't doesn't have a
you know a strong enough signal it'll do this
and that's strange because if it's if it's not strong enough then why is it that when you go slow motion or freeze frame or fast forward through it you can see the picture but
when it you play it normal it goes in and out that's very bizarre to me
and i have the worst time trying to -st get him look at this problem and it ends up that they you know they just concluded that's all that's wrong with it and that's nothing wrong with the product and i said
well i don't know it's hard to say it's there's nothing i could it didn't seem like there was much i could do about it
no i don't know
things like that with all the electronics in the cars but say it gets a lot better gas mileage and
but then when i give myself a chance to think about it a little bit more i recognize the positives as well
positives for sure are technology and
some of the changes that the computer age has brought i think that kids growing up today are just
very much more facile than i was as a kid in terms of the use of computer technology and you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
um-hum and the earlier you learn
yes the younger you are probably the easier it is
some of that i think probably we take for granted you know the changes have happened so rapidly that it's easy for us to forget how quickly it has changed
i think probably the other thing i that came to mind is the increased awareness on our part of the criminal element if i can put it that way you know you don't
you don't casually let kids play in the street or you know ride their bike to friends if you're in an area where you're at all concerned about
abduction
i think it's changed i think that in the last twenty or thirty years there's definitely been an increase in that type of crime
and i'm not sure why you know certainly a question that we could spend hours on you know whether there is a change in
in the way a lot of individuals grow up whether or not there is you know more mental illness or something that causes that sort of
thing to go on i don't know
but you know kidnapping is a strange thing you know what kids today are not nearly as free as i was when i was a kid in terms of just being able to go to the store by myself or riding my bike around the neighborhood or
being informed at a very young age about going to a shopping center and what to do if a stranger approaches you i mean i never had a concept of that as a kid so that's certainly changed a lot in the last ten or twenty years
huh
uh-huh
it really does bring us together as a global community doesn't it
um-hum
that's a good point
uh-huh
i think that's something that is a political influence as well you know probably people feel it on a personal level more than they might
on a on a global level you know just being informed about what other countries and
other cultures are doing
in a way that we might have not been informed before but yet politically their activities aren't
influencing how our leaders direct
legislation as much as they could
it's still really focused on our interests you know what i mean
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
mcdonald's
burning up the
what else has changed social changes i think that there's probably a greater awareness sensitivity on the part of men and women to what the other
is adjusting to in life
do regular exercise
have you have you tried you know beginning something and it hasn't worked so you've
stopped after a while or just try to get
well that's good i mean at least you've given some time to it every day it's not as if you're not doing anything
it is you know i think the problem for me has always been trying to find a time of day that's going to work
i think probably the best way to get it done is to do it in the morning but i'm not a morning person
and if i try to wait till the end of the day when i think i have a little bit more time i don't always have the energy level
yeah
you get home and you start fixing dinner or whatever
i've tried to do a combination of stretching and strengthening because my problem has been
keeping strong i think enough i tend if i don't
i tend to have over stretched muscles in fact it's called a hypomobility
but if i don't keep strong enough i can pull a muscle more easily say if i go on vacation
and pick up some heavy suitcases it might stretch a muscle that
would not have felt injured if i had kept the muscle strong enough to really support the joints so
that's
i'm definitely going to because i work at a hospital where there is a physical therapy department and i've used their barbells for a long while but i know i need to get more regular and do it at home so if i
purchase my own i think i'm more inclined to do so and they're a good price
see i can't do that
yeah and
that's exactly the same with me
oh so you've thought about that as well a bike exercise
um-hum
uh-huh
well
right
feel it in your neck in other words
uh-huh
it's interesting some people choose to go to classes because they feel that will maintain their motivation they've either invested the money in it or there're people there that expect them or
whatever but i think it's just the opposite with me i need to have the flexibility to do it on my own time and yet
it is beautiful um-hum
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
needs to be more flexible for your schedule
um-hum
hi ed
hi
oh
who wrote that
huh
i see
well that is
all right
that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that
yeah
explained like
supposedly scooped up by the triangle yeah
yeah on that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the amelia earhart story whatever happened with her
i think that would be i am sure there is something out there that might be a
i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years well whatever this is one aspect of it of course you know it is so weird cause no one will ever really know it's it the
so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things that is for sure
yeah
right well i just i guess haven't read i mean usually i just if i find a good book i will sit you know for two days until it is finished if it's that good and i think the last one i read like that was scott thurow's
and that was presumed innocent
and i just really liked the way he writes it's just
incredible
yeah
that was good i think and the other book i am trying to think you know like was in the last year and i think i did read tom wolfe and vanity you know bon yeah
yeah i that was really good the movie was nothing compared to the book and yeah
society's ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things and
and so it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
yeah
oh
so what kind of dining out do you enjoy
uh-huh four children or
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
so that has a children's menu or uh-huh
well i don't have any children and i'm a newlywed
so right now i guess my favorite type of restaurant is a place that's fairly quiet and has a pleasant atmosphere
i sort of like the either an old country look or dim lights or something just you know the
well i enjoy steak and ale yeah that's that seems to have a pretty nice atmosphere usually not i don't like noise i just hate it when restaurants are like bennigan's and
that's the other one that i really like yeah i haven't the in plano i haven't oh yeah
yeah i've been to one here in dallas
yeah they are they really are i've only been there once but almost a year ago and i wanna go back i'd thought about it ever since it's not on our side of town
yeah
yeah exactly
uh-huh
yeah i like to have a choice of fish or chicken and italian food mexican food
you know something
yeah something that i wouldn't
that takes more time to cook at home
i'd say well one thing is the price i don't like it
yeah if it's overpriced or you know i mean if it's i like to still be able to get a meal for well i'd prefer five dollars or less they that's unusual these days if you go out
uh-huh well let's see there's one up at see what is it just as loop twelve turns into thirty five it merges it's right there it's sort of a restaurant row in dallas there
and then there's also one down at the marketplace west end marketplace
and we found out one day by mistake that lunch is about half as much as dinner is and you get almost the same amount
yeah um-hum
so i'd say that's the first thing i look for is price and then atmosphere
yeah how about you
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah so what would your favorite place be or one of your favorites
or some of your favorites
no i've never heard of that
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i like chinese too
yeah and sometimes you can you can often get that at a good price
and some of them have good atmosphere too so
hum
uh-huh
yeah some of them don't
yeah
yeah
right
yeah i'm sure it does
yeah -at's what i found too
so
well
camping is a pretty vague term it seems to encounter or cover a lot of different kinds of
of shall we say over night trips or sometimes not even over night anything from no provisions to going with what you can carry on a backpack maybe even a tent
go up to state parks with six shelters and little screened in areas and then travel trailers and all the way up to conference center type campings that have you know air conditioning like hotels with
so i've been through most all of that i've not done much of the no provision survival type but i've done backpacking in tents and state park shelters and travel trailers and camping with nice air conditioned rooms
one of the times that we were at a state park we went up into oklahoma and went to a place called broken bow and
rented a few canoes with a church group we were with bunch of college age kids
worked our way back down toward the campsite that we were at
and you just never can time those things right with the water the way you would like them to be we got there and the water was really low we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and
at one point even though i know your not supposed to do this i stood up in the canoe and reached my paddle up as high as i could and i could not even touch the branches that were over the
so it was you know ten or so feet higher just a few weeks ago in fact a few weeks prior to when we got there and the
camp the people at the campgrounds told us that asked where we were from and we said dallas and they said oh well we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that rage of water
well that's encouraging but they said oh you have nothing to worry about you'll have the opposite problem you may die of carrying your canoe and sure enough it was a little bit laborious instead of a six to eight hours worth of canoeing we ended up only
surviving about half the trip and it took us about ten hours so we got in our car half way and went and got the rest of the vehicles and brought them up stream and
loaded it all back up and went back to the campsite exhausted but i have had better camping canoeing trips as it were like the guadalupe down in south texas it's got some real nice
canoeing water in it have you been camping much
um-hum
hum
um-hum
yeah
i wonder if being from
dallas area i wonder if it's just this area that's doesn't encourage that type of camping i seems like back packing goes well with
mountain and sceneries worth seeing by foot where as here your looking as you know you can go two hundred miles and your probably in the same kind of environment you were in when you left so
unless you go over toward east texas where there's a considerable amount of woods or if you go
extreme south part where there's some things worth seeing by foot the majority of camping experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where you're looking at the state parks all seem to have something of a
a either a lake that you'd go canoeing or skiing or whatever kind of sailing boating you want to do
but there's not a whole lot of trails built in a lot of state parks there are in more of the eastern part of the state where there's woods worth seeing but that's interesting i hadn't
all the people that i know that do back packing usually go up to colorado or go up somewhere and you know get away from the state to actually do that kind of camping
that's not too bad
that's not too bad at all
um-hum
yeah
huh
yeah that would be one of my very first experiences of tent camping if it were with a group of people we went up to a state park that was
oh the campsites were
not perfect but they were you know basic rail road ties and laid in sand so it wasn't just the actual terrain and it had a somewhat level and it had a place to stick your tent and some
you could drive a stake in fairly easy and get the thing nailed down but that's usually a little windy on a lake edge
and the very first time we went up there with this group of people we all set up these tents most of which were borrowed and we were having to figure out you know how this particular one works and how this one works and it's eleven o'clock at night and it's you know your doing it by the head lights of the cars and
and about oh a little after midnight we got all these tents set up and i laid down inside one of them and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the tent said asked if i was doing all right and i said
huh yeah doing just fine you know it's a little windy but i'm doing all right and
and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and the winds were just terrible and
then it started to rain so we didn't get too wet but it rained just for a little bit then went on and so after all that was over we put them all back up and
woke up a little late the next morning but when we finally got back from that outing one of the parents of one of the kids had asked how it went and said that he was listening to the
the radio and they clocked a ninety seven mile an hour winds on the dam right in front of that lake and there's really nothing to stop it it's thirty or forty miles wide it's a huge
lake right on the border of texas and oklahoma there and
and it had a the little part that we were on was the peninsula with no trees so we were just stuck out in the water with nothing blocking us from this wind it's a wonder we didn't lose a lot more than that but i'm sure that was just
the top speed of the wind but it did manage to take all our tents out
yeah
yeah that's for sure
yep
that's true
on that same lake there's another portion of it that's
real carved out the
shoreline is
up against rock and it's pretty far cliff i'd say shirt or forty feet worth
and the campsites are up top and then you go down and there's a little path where the little rail road ties again will try to stop the erosion on the path and little stair steps all the way down to this beach
and that was a that particular campout
i mean i really can't see how it was i think the more interesting part of the question to me was the effect that it had on the us
you
yeah good point but i was you know i was while i was waiting for a connection i was just thinking about it i said you know the
i don't know if without the vietnam war if we would have had you know all the hippie era the protestors demonstrations
you know and the effect that it had on rock and roll and you know all of the baby boomers i mean i think it you know has a profound effect on all of us
right
right
yeah likewise
wow
oh well see my the
i had i had forgot i hadn't even thought about that in a long time i had two numbers the lowest one i had was like a sixty eight i think and then another one i had like a one thirty seven i think you know
yeah but you know none the less i was busy going to college when that was happening you know
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i think that i think what it showed though was that you know america was is not invincible and all powerful and you know it also shows that
even with the kind of money that was thrown into it and the
armaments with the way it was waged which was not an all out war and i guess that's the other thing too it was never a declared war so you know it never did really have the backing of the people
oh and i agree with that but it was it was such a limited you know one hand tied behind your back
yeah
right
yeah
why was that
yeah
yeah good point
oh really
really how interesting
oh right but i mean you know they took you know all the data that had been produced from back in the late eighties middle mid to late eighties about
yeah really
hum
really
well what kind of fishing do you do down there lisa
bass
is that right how'd you do how did you do
huh
do you is it a two day event or
hm
um-hum
huh how do those tournaments work you know i've seen them on television and stuff
i see
do they have men and women's divisions or is it just all everybody
i see
so it's the you do it as a joint combination
uh-huh
i see do you do you fish for a particular team like ti like you were telling me or
um-hum
huh
that sounds fun
do you fish for anything besides bass
um-hum
yep
mainly salmon and steel head king salmon chinook and
i enjoy a little bit of trout fishing fly fishing out of float tubes on high mountain lakes i enjoy that that's probably my favorite
that's a lot of fun that is a lot of fun
but the king salmon fishing too is fun too we i got to alaska this year most of the time we just spend fishing around here but
that was a lot of fun we got into some really nice fishing
one night i went down on a river called the kishloff river
and they were catching red salmon they're smaller salmon
and it was just great it was about every fifth cast you'd hook one and
and they were anywhere between eight and twelve fifteen pounds and
it just wonderful the water was very swift and fast and so the fish were even with twenty pound test line i was breaking them off you know quite frequently
so but that that's probably the best fishing i've been in my whole life was that night there
yep have you ever
have you ever been salmon fishing at all
um-hum yes uh-huh you troll with them troll for them yes
huh
uh-huh
the biggest problem is you get hooked on it now you know so i can't i can't make it next year but in ninety three i'm sure trying to go back and
you just it's almost like you can't get your fill of it is it is so it's just nothing like what we're we've got around here
and there was three of us in the boat fishing and probably every five minutes somebody had a halibut on
it was great they weren't very big the biggest one we caught that day was thirty five pounds but it just lots and lots of action
and so i really enjoyed that
just the halibut that's they bottom fish for halibut but no i haven't have you
uh-huh
yes um-hum
i've heard that sailfish are a lot of fun to catch
well do you have any television programs that you watch regularly
uh-huh
no
uh-huh
oh you will
relax
well i watch i like news programs like you mentioned and sometimes i will watch like the cable news network evening news program
yeah i like that i watch that a couple of times a week
it comes on like at nine o'clock at night and i really don't have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly i have seen that
murphy brown that comes on monday nights before and it's kind of cute and but i don't
uh-huh
oh the
uh-huh
right i know who you're talking about i haven't i have seen it i think maybe once
well i we really don't watch
too many programs regularly my children like some of the morning children's shows when they're home they i just have one son who's in kindergarten so in the morning they will like to watch like
eureka's castle it's called it's just like a sesame street show but
and they watch a couple of shows like that
but i don't watch any daytime tv at all
and
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh that's nice
uh-huh
that sounds like a good idea
i notice that since we moved here that we did get the cable tv and when the newspaper comes out on sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed
and i record some and then we have just totally cut down and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because
there's always plenty of things that we can record and then watch and then record over it something else
and so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved
uh-huh
well that's probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is
the movies and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies
right and so we have really enjoyed that and it's really nice not to be running out some of the video rentals can be expensive and
and
um-hum right going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something so we i have and it's so convenient at home and you can do it anytime you take the notion
and so i have really enjoyed that but there are i do have friends that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and
they are either home watching it or definitely recording it they have some programs that they won't miss
yes well and things are repeated
so often that
the only one i've ever seen and it'll be showing again
pretty funny
but tv is something that we try to not deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say
um-hum and we don't want our kids to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your spare time
so it's a little bit
something we try doing and there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day
and you could say oh that's a good program for them because it's educational but still you want them to go out and do other things even if they're good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them
anyway
well
yeah that was pretty good i like that and i guess it's time to go
yes nice to have spoken with you too bye-bye
so i guess right now what's most important for me doing is coming up is we have a really good stock program
where i work and it's gonna give me about a three hundred percent return
this time around on my investment
which is definitely helping since i'm gonna buy a house
yeah what they do what they do is it's a purchase program
where you get the stock it's on a one year cycle and you get it at eighty five percent of the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year
so like the set price at the beginning of the year last may was five sixty four a share
stocks trading about fourteen now
so and you so i'll get to buy it at five sixty four and turn around the same day
the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your income so you got to kind of you know be willing to squirrel away at whatever you wanna do
yeah
that's with interleaf
interleaf
desktop publishing
so
but you know
yeah benefits other than salary
right
right
yeah we we've got a 401k here
but i chose to go into the stock program because you can't lose on it and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the house i would be putting money into a 401k
but you know i'd much rather get the eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house
but yeah you know medical is good you know we get a good program here what's basically a hundred percent coverage for about twenty bucks a month
the health coverage they've got you know the stock program they've got 125k selling it for twenty bucks they do put it in the you know dental is like you know eighty or fifty percent depending on what you're doing
and you know you the 125k means i can pay that piece out of pre tax money rather than post tax
the only problem with 125k is you got to say at the beginning of the year i think i'm gonna have a thousand dollars of expenses this year and then you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you don't use the thousand dollars it goes away
so at the end of the year if you haven't used it all up it's you know the feds take it or whoever takes it just disappears
but you know if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars a year of dental and miscellaneous medical and deductibles
so i just have them pull you know five hundred it means i pay like you know as opposed to paying like you know eight hundred dollars i pay or five hundred i pay like three hundred because it's on pre tax
yeah i'm here
yeah
yeah
i don't like working in an organization where you're really deep in the tree
because then you start to feel like you've got no real you know power to change anything
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah but there's two sides to that because also you know i've seen a lot of i knew somebody who worked for digital and for two years he worked on like you know the tape driver for one tape drive and that's all he did
there we go
the bermuda grass is greening up
in march it sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of april so
so i think we're a little -head ahead of schedule on that
yeah now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny
well yeah but i'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend so
yeah
yeah
well that's good
on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy
yeah
yeah that's true
of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high
and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable
that it doesn't vary very much
i mean any other time of year that's not the case because it could be very warm or very cold
uh-huh
right
right
and i thought well gee i've never known it to lightning at that temperature
that's right it probably was a lot warmer up high
sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that
twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing
the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees
because the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away
nope
not too challenging to the brain
nope
bye-bye
okay
i do have friends that have children yes
they
i think that's correct there i relatively not existent from what i hear from my friends it seems like
even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally
and it's just a matter of trust you know i think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and underpaid
and i think that sort of goes hand in hand so it's difficult for them
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i'm sure that's true
um-hum
right
right i do have a friend that she and her roommate became live in care givers and they loved it they had stayed with this family from the time
these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school
and she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a good job
so i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the finances to be able to do that
yeah
yeah i think it's just a matter of priorities it's
you know a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way but you still have to be realistic as well i think
yeah
um-hum
yeah and that's sad to have to admit too but
you know it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home and i think that's one reason why i continue to be without children i
it's just such a such a responsibility and when i've had friends that have said
when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed and realize that that's true so it's such a responsibility
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
yeah most of the time
yeah oh sure
sure
right
but you know it's funny i did i had a friend that said you know before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other and she got older she said but you know but we never do those things anyway so
the thing about the child care i
and when i seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know to someone else and
it's just i can imagine how emotional it must be and you know multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation you've been placed in as far as child care goes it's just a scary thing
um-hum
that's a big plus yes
right
right
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
right
yeah
um-hum
you know taking care of a baby i know is not an easy thing but when you have them in their little feet are moving and you have to chase them down constantly i'm sure that's a whole new ball game
is that that's something all together different huh
um-hum
oh of course not
uh-huh
no
that's out of the question i'm sure
right um-hum
that's amazing it's amazing that people actually the stamina that you must you know draw from yourself to deal with it must be interesting i guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought maybe
uh-huh
and now it's just it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly i'm sure
well are your are your children now do you feel comfortable with them coming home and after school until you and your wife get home or
no yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
and it's the one that's they're going downhill is it is it the one that needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or on the more mature one
how unfortunate
well i you know i'm living in a dream world what do i know as i said i don't have kids and i'm an only child so i've never been around children
so i'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned but i do hear my friends talk about it
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
that's like world war three every minute
i don't know i have to admit i was a i was selfish as a child i didn't want a brother or sister and now that i'm older of course it's different you know i think about wouldn't it be nice but anyway
yeah oh i have wonderful friends that's true my best friend is a is one child of ten
so they just sort of you know adopted me as their eleventh child so that worked out pretty well she never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them so i guess that's an alternative you could just
have a whole bunch and by the time the little the youngest ones are there you'll have old ones to take care of them
yeah i don't know it just see when you see all these horror stories on television about child care and
gosh i just i was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories and of course people are denying it
and it's just frightening it really is
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
oh my
i'm happy with it i'm happy with their school it's great good teachers good curriculum
they learn a lot they have no problems but i do live in the better
and well in the best part of the city though i live in you know the real richy part i guess i'm not but everybody around me is and but the i have friends that live in the other the
less fortunate or whatever you wanna call it part of town and their schools are kind of rundown and
older and they don't really
but you know i'm happy with what they're in so
um-hum
wow
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
also the family environment
you know you can come to south tyler where i live and you have got room mothers in every room you've got art mothers you've got every holiday there's parties
all the kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something you can go to north tyler to the schools and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is
you know
that has a whole lot to do with it you know as far as their learning i mean if the parents aren't
you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning
you know they really don't have much of a chance at all and
huh
i know what they're learning and if they're up i call and find out you know is she having problems does she need help with anything no she's doing fine okay you know
and i know kids that their parents could really give a rip and the kids are not motivated
they have no motivation from home so they just go to school and you know eh you know i'll get through the day and bring homework home and there's nobody to sit them down and say you're going to do this
just you know they take a notion to do it they do and that doesn't work either you know they have to have guidance and they can't just have it at school and then come home and there's nothing
you know
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
well i usually keep up with news by watching abc news on television and reading the papers here the local dallas morning news and then i also take the wall street journal
yeah well i well i at the office i generally catch the wall street journal at lunchtime i use part of my lunch period to read the wall street journal
then i read the newspaper at home generally in the evening i'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning
yeah that's what we do to it we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television so we catch the ten o'clock news but i catch the news on the radio coming
to and from work but radio news is rather short most of the news stations most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour
yeah but i
yeah i have the same situation i tried the news magazines like time newsweek us news and world report and
they'd just stack up i wouldn't find time to read them you have to have time to sit down and concentrate on the stories or all of a sudden you look and there's three weeks worth laying on the coffee table
and you wind up throwing them out without reading them because it's too much trouble to try and catch up so
have to depend i guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that
i don't think that my children even read newspapers other than the tv guide section of the there's is all strictly television news
oh yeah
yeah
right it's the same thing with the news magazines like time and the other magazines it's hard to celebrate to separate
the news from the comment because in the way it's presented their opinions is printed or presented as being the news
and so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news
that's right that's
right
well so many of them also come through and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time whether it be the homeless or
cancer or whatever and then they devote an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal axe to grind
and i particularly the local television i know the wednesday's child bit
and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something i'm not saying that's not important but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects
yes so
yeah
yeah
yeah we
and my wife and i feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own it's always there's something going on all the time you don't really have time to sit down and
and thoroughly read a newspaper as a matter of fact i read the sunday paper this evening we had such a busy day yesterday
nice talking with you same to you
have you had to return anything lately
did you think it was the mechanic's problem or well with the bolt
did you have to pay this fellow
no i was doing some thinking about products and have they really changed
i think it's hard to say cross the board that you're not getting what you're getting what you pay for anymore
i just recently had an experience with sears do you have that down in florida
well sears is kind of famous for taking back almost anything they're very good about it
i had bought a leather jacket almost about twelve years ago for my ex-husband
this makes no sense the good guy didn't get the good jacket
and i called them up and i said i would expect a winter coat you know we do have in winters in new york and i guess you use it four months out of the year
this guy didn't get eight months out of a winter coat all the stitches were coming out it's a real mess
you know i really expect you to do something about this and i hadn't really hang on to receipts or anything and it took much song and dance
to get it done but i just picked up a brand new leather jacket today
so i'm pretty pleased about that the thing is it only cost about a hundred dollars which for a leather jacket is quite reasonable
but the repair i was going to just bring it in and have it repair the repair would've been about seventy
and i was darned if i was going to do it and i hated to throw it out
so i think if you make enough noise you can get your problems taken care of in most cases
and i think it's how you conduct yourself as well if you're kind of mean and nasty you get treated mean and nasty
but i was very please and it is true i you know generally they back up what they have and
it worked out nicely fortunately and it's you know it's like you know when someone else hits your car it's not your fault and you don't pay for it but you're majorly inconvenienced
but
right well you were talking about boats it made me think about cars i had a ford station wagon that one day just died
and i called up the repair shop apparently this some kind of box in the ford car that just dies and they know it dies
and in every car you're going to have that's a ford car it's going to die and i guess after so many miles
and he told me over the phone before he even saw my car that's probably what it was
huh
and you really don't know when it's going to happen you just know that you're going to be stranded if you get another ford
and
it's kind of upsetting
at the time i knew what it did and what it was called but i don't remember that now
uh-huh
and how did you spend time with them when they were young
um-hum
well
um-hum
how many children do you have oh um-hum
um-hum well i had two boys and i'm a grandmother now so my children are grown also and they live away from me so i don't see them much but
uh-huh
oh i tried to spend a lot of time with my children when they were young we spent lot of value time creating things and
building things together i feel the families watch too much tv today
um-hum
well i tried to put a limit on it when they were in school to so they could only watch so many hours per day of tv so
well we moved around quite a bit so they went to a lot of different schools
no
they did go a year in palestine
but we did move around quite a bit so
but
right
i don't think so either it takes two incomes now anyway
but i feel that i didn't get to spend as much time with my children as i could have
or as i should have i was a working mother and
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
i remember the things that they really liked my oldest son he liked kites he always wanted always building kites and working on those he loved kites
uh-huh
well mine they were in the music end of it instead of sports they did my oldest son did play a little football and soccer but i had them in the band they were playing horns in the band
yeah nobody's perfect all you can do is your best and
uh-huh
well i have three grandsons now and i one of them two of them's in california and one of them's in arizona and i'm gonna get to see them at christmas time so
i it's gonna i'm gonna enjoy that
they're all little they're little kids so but i bought little things for them to work on and to try to keep them busy um-hum
no i'm going to drive to arizona hum
it's worth it to see my family
oh yes uh-huh
i have a sister in new mexico so i'm gonna stop there at my sister's uh-huh
well the they won't be upset with us if we hang up too soon
i haven't done that before usually i talk and talk and talk
yeah when our five minutes are up
oh i'm just a temporary i work for manpower there and
oh
oh that's very few people are interested in that history yeah and chemistry
what are your son your children what are they going into they you said they were in college
oh one of my favorite towns i'm in houston
yeah
has it really
yeah austin is a actually i my brother and sister-in-law live in austin and it is one of my favorite locations it's just i think it's beautiful
how long have you lived there
yeah practically a native
yeah
how hot does it get there in the summer time
yeah
yeah
but
for some reason and i guess it's
not having just the extreme heat i mean we had one year we had in dallas a you know i guess a week or more where it never got
below of that eighty two or eighty three degrees at night and then over a hundred every day and that got to be awfully oppressive
yeah
yeah
you know you know it makes you wonder how anyone ever lived before air conditioning
how much snow did you get in kansas
no
yeah
oh no
oh no
yeah
oh no
did you did you keep it going
yeah
yeah
and it got you know reasonably cold up there in the in the winter time but i have never lived anywhere where i really had to battle snow and i don't think i want to
yeah
yeah
i weight train three days on and one day off
i don't know maybe three times maybe four times a week i play basketball couple times a week i play softball one night a week
that's what i do what about yourself
uh-huh
oh really
yeah what do you ride like bunch of hills or pretty flat
how long does that take you to get to work
how does that work out with storing your bike and showering and all that
uh-huh
right
yeah do you ride a lot of rallies are lot of those around there
uh-huh
well actually my wife just got me into it and i did a did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas at cooper clinic and i learned all the health benefits of
once i got into this internship i learned all the physiological
i'm looking at doing a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it and i kind of
held her back a little bit this weekend she wanted to go but you know she wanted to stay with me
yeah it really is
yeah that'd be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that
oh
i've never really looked into that you know that's my wife would just love that and i may do that sometime there again i'm just kind of a fledgling into this
i've it's kind of funny i'd called this number and i just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up i mean around texas you
you got about five or six if you live around the dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from because they're really into it
you know you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that are above the age of fifteen or something but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here
probably
yeah
there are a lot of a lot of resources lot of magazines and stuff little texas bicyclist is like a newspaper that comes out every month
and it's free you just go to the bike shock bike shop and pick it up and it's got all the rides coming up so i guess i'm gonna be busy about every saturday this summer going to a different ride yeah see a little bit of texas i've never seen before
so how long have you been biking
yeah
have you ever had a it's kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a blood work up done recently or since you been biking to see if it because it really
from what i understand it really improves your cholesterol and you know it kind of knocks you down two the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is
low cardiovascular fitness and also you know the cholesterol it gives you increased hdls and decreases your ldls yeah so
yeah
really that's good
you say you ride about a hundred fifty miles a week man that's hard core when do you get to begin with the winters and all that
or what time of the year do you usually embark on your do you ride inside if you can't ride outside
hm
uh-huh
yeah
right
so you change up your routes a lot and keep a
so what school is it
oh okay
yeah
yeah
yeah -'s true sounds neat it's kind of i was wondering if i was gonna
talk with someone that never -as exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week that's motivating
-'s really good
well
good talking to you and keep up the good work all right take care bye
i guess i've always been kind of interested in space and stuff i've read a lot of the astronomy books and stuff like that
to a degree i haven't kept up as much as i'd like i've just been so busy i barely get a chance
read a newspaper now and then so
yeah
well i wouldn't even mind being a pilot on one or right now but i'm probably getting a little too old for that uh-huh
right yeah well they just made leaps and jumps i think a lot of our technology we have is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel
equipment and stuff that
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i don't know if you ever watch gallagher you know he's one of the comedians and
and you know he talks a lot on velcro
yeah
yeah
yeah now there's a lot of lot of little things that have come up i know maybe some of the big things that
concentrated foods for one maybe i
i don't know it's also just i've often pictured in my mind you know what it'd be like to just what would you find if you just kept on going kept on going
i guess our minds are so
what is it finite
when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object
it it's hard to see you know i always thought well what do you do hit a brick wall eventually it's hard to consider that something could go on
indefinitely
yeah
but
yeah i know it's i think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something and i i'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or like you know
yeah
huh
i think that's what made us progress to the state we are is our curiosity
there must be some betters a better way of doing this a better place to be or whatever you know it's
so you you're always looking for something better
i know at work people always complain to me i well you're always whining and i say well i'm always looking for something better
there's a better way of doing it than what we're doing it
yeah
well they they're always finding easier ways and you know just because they don't talk about it or something like that and
they're doing it you know unconsciously and
um-hum
right yeah
are you saying that there's more bureaucracy et cetera at out in california at that particular school
ah
that seems so wasteful
i was thinking in terms of how would you advise a kid on how to pick his future career i have a son whose a freshman in high school
and he hasn't got a clue you know what he wants to do you know he's good in math and science and he'll you know
his stepdad's an engineer his father's an accountant you know he he'll probably lean toward some kind of math or science kind of thing but he's not sure what i myself graduated with an undergraduate and a master's in art
and i did it because it's just something i love to do and i felt that
i'm not i'm not a picasso so i guess i'll teach and i kind of backed myself into a career that i never ended up really using i mean now that i'm raising my kids i'm substitute teaching because the hours are so good et cetera
but i had never given that much thought to whether i actually liked to teach you know it just seemed that well that's a practical thing you can do with art so you might as well do it
and i guess my advice to kids approaching college would
first of all do something practical because the art for me didn't work out very practically i got out of school when the vietnam draft evasion was going on and everybody wanted to be a teacher there were no jobs
and i ended up taking a secretarial school summer class for graduate college graduates which it struck me as so
so sad you know there's a whole bunch of college graduates who are learning how to type just to be able to make some money
and
hum
to pick so you you're suggesting some liberal arts program where you take a smattering of everything
um-hum
um-hum
oh that
hi
you didn't try we rewallpapering you just
did you use a textured paint or
well did you get good results
yeah
but just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it
well we did a
we moved oh last august and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to i've forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down
and then you can just paint right over the dark
well more or less after about half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the dark it was just a real dark wood grain type paneling
and it was smooth and we would we put this stuff on and it supposedly textured it or did something to it and
but because of the dark behind it was really hard to cover
and
yeah it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we hadn't done it because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to do you know make it and it really was
you know the advice they give you is the job was considerably tougher than we thought
particularly when you try to i was talking to somebody else who had a lot of wood paneling and
they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot paneling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something
have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted
yeah
yeah
oh that's quite reasonable
the problem is have you have you tried matching paint lately
and she wanted to paint the shed it's a it's a wooden shed and she took it and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint
and they got and in fact she put some right she got they mixed a gallon of it and it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint
and it does it oh electronically some something magic
yeah you know they it but it's electronic
you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it and determines the
and it it's really remarkable the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim
and but they didn't occur to them that they could have taken a sample
from i forgotten this is sherwin williams paint or something but anyway it's remarkable that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the
you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it's all white you're all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match
so
gosh
so you so what's your what's the solution then
oh my
well at least you'll get very good at it right
you could go back and paint the whole thing over that's this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do i'll just do a little bit here and a little that
although the it's it we almost one day we painted the house to we painted we painted the whole inside
and it had all this dark trim we thought you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't the mold everything is white in a new house everything is white
makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding like picture frames i don't know what you call that actually that are along the walls that you know up a couple of feet
and my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue
and
the trim is still white
the molding but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive but it makes the room look smaller which is
which is it explains why they why they have everything white but i you wouldn't think that i well
maybe somebody that understands colors would know all of that stuff but
not particularly because the house has so many windows it has the living room has four good size windows
and well of course at night but with the
we have we have we have a soccer field that's oh about a hundred yards from our house
and the lights shine right at our house it's kind of
we didn't know that when we bought the house but
yeah we have a lot of light yeah and well it well it's just i think it's just the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so
anyway it didn't it didn't change but the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away it didn't it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we're
we're really on to that the masking is you have to do that very carefully
that's right you can work yourself to death well i'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend
it's kind of frustrating
well i've got to go to a meeting it's been good talking to you
okay good-bye
um-hum yeah one of my friends are into macintoshes i have a pc my a ibm pc myself
a two eighty six but i'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty six
mostly word processing applications and just as a dumb terminal
but i'm i think eventually i'll start using it for spread sheets and things like that what do you find that you use yours mostly for
um-hum
um-hum
no i think i i'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty six before i move up to windows although you know i do like the graphical user environment yeah
um-hum
yeah i that's what i learned a lot of languages on was an apple two e in my high school
um-hum
um-hum
well do you use your computer for
just things around the house or in the in the
i see what do you do
oh wow and are these like do these programs
are they are they based on a on a
other language or are they based are they based like a lot of the i know a lot of the english as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world
and the teacher just tries to tries to teach english you know through natural understanding
um-hum
well it was just when i was in high school i worked for the community school and they had a english second language class and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know
spoke english not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many cues you can't don't have hand gestures and things like that
um-hum
um-hum
oh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i'd imagine so
so what were you doing when you were using an apple two e
um-hum it it's
yes it it's amazing you know how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much i remember my first computer was a trs eighty with four k on it
and you know and then i and then i started playing with apples you know and those had forty eight or you know if they were really great they had sixty four k you know
all i know i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen k on them
is all and there's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty eight k and there was only one computer that had forty eight k on it at the time
and you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you i'm not sure about macintoshes but i know in ibm's you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time
you know that's your low that's the low end
um-hum
um-hum yeah imagine just to support
all right
okay
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
oh okay
uh-huh
hum
well right now we're having the little bit of spring that we have yeah
we don't have many seasons here it goes from winter to summer usually
i don't know we've got we had one of those blow through tonight
so
it's
it's gotten up to ninety a couple of times
but basically been in the low seventies and eighties
yeah it's not really been too bad because usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier
yeah quite a bit in fact the well the season's just about over for that in fact we drove down to corpus last week
and there were still some indian paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way
funny we drove through san antonio and i spoke to somebody else this morning from san antonio
yeah we're
they had that we came back what day was that
sunday evening and they had a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing we're getting now i guess
yeah this that's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy spring we had a pretty rainy fall last year as well
we had a few down here but not anything like kansas and this is the season for that
they do they do pop up occasionally around here
yeah
yeah i'm from here originally so july and august i'm pretty well used to the hundred degree temperatures and stuff
the biggest problem with the with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil it's that black clay soil
it's kind of you know it's not sandy like most of the state is so it doesn't absorb
the water real well i mean once it rains a little bit it's
it's filled up and everything else just runs off so
yeah
yeah we have it especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years there's a
there's a section in south dallas that has had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain
really
huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
hm
yeah
uh-hum
um-hum
huh uh-huh
yeah
hm
i guess i'd prefer that
to the way
yeah
um-hum
yeah
we it's pretty dry we get some when it's this rainy but it's nothing like i guess san antonio summers it's nothing like houston
for instance it'd be or east texas is a little more humid
huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah probably the pacific breezes make a lot of difference in that
that's nice
yeah my wife's originally from virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me
parts do we were over in the western edge in the mountains
and they have of course some pretty severe
storms winter storms snow and that type of thing
but they're so good about clearing the roads that you know it doesn't usually bother you very much
yeah and their springs and summers are pretty mild too it never gets real hot there
uh-huh
yeah
well funny as we were talking the weather came on and there's a flash flood watch and
well i enjoyed talking with you lisa
uh-huh you too
bye
well since i'm in college i mean
twenty years anyway but i don't know do you do you have an idea of how much
more lax
um-hum
maybe people are a little more open-minded than maybe they used to be
uh-huh
right
right
yeah maybe people are a little a little more free to express their opinions socially free
oh yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right just wasn't socially acceptable
people's views on relationships has changed you know and now we have now we have several you know we have to worry about aids and we have to worry about
maybe people are becoming more aware more afraid of relationships
uh-huh
right yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right it used to be that we were that we were trying to protect morality now it's we're protecting our lives it's a it's a much different we have you know you can't just hope for abstinence
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah i imagine you're right i teach swim lessons a lot and to see what see what kids talk about you know they're open about well you know kids are a lot more educated now than i think that like we were at that age
about a lot of things you know besides what besides what they learn from
from our social environment is their education is just amazing kids are kids are learning you know their math is just every year algebra goes down a grade you know and students learn it earlier
well let's see i see i'm gonna i'm gonna be guilty of not being able to say a whole lot about this i'm not real
and so the money i have left over is pretty much put into investments
so i'm real guilty of not really doing a whole lot of planning as to how i'm going to set things aside it just it either goes into investment or it goes into things that i want
well the one thing i've always done is i've put on my on my from when i started even since the very beginning i always said that i would put five hundred dollars aside every month
right and
right oh it is a budget i mean i certainly consider it to be a budget but i was just under the idea that
i knew i would be able to do that and that you have to be responsible for your own
and i said that well you know if i
if i start making a significant more amount of money i would put more into it
and make a new budget but i've
so although i have not i have not changed that number even though you know cost of living has made it equivalently less
yeah
right
um-hum
yeah
so that makes it a lot that makes it of course a lot easier and i've always been fairly conscientious i've never really
i don't buy anything really on a whim i do buy things
that i want even though i may not they may not be something that i really need but i always find the best price for it and i look around for a long time and let it let myself get past that initial state
right
right you know i don't just sit there oh i like that i got to get it no i say now give myself a little time to sit there and say do i really want it and if i really want it then i try to look for a good price for it
and then i buy it
but i do
um-hum
rock
oh
oh everything
what era of rock and roll or whatever did you
i guess we listen to a lot of things i grew up with the with rock and roll and older brothers and sisters
and so i remember always being kind of ahead of my
you know in third grade i was listening to groups and stuff that you know third graders usually aren't interested in music by that time
and i think now i listen we listen to a variety of stuff jazz or and western or
do you not i don't like the old the old
yeah i
i there
i think country music i don't like the real old twangy stuff like the
you know but it has undergone a lot of change and there's a like there's a guy named lyle lovett that he could be considered
but
yeah see he it's more what do they call it
sometimes i've heard it called rockabilly where it's like rock and roll and or country but they refer to him you know as a country singer but a lot of his stuff sounds really jazzy
they i mean they term him as that but i know well i've watched like the music awards or the country music awards before and they had him on as a new up and coming country singer
so it's kind of i mean but there's a lot of people kind of like that
they're right on the line and you know the
at the i guess the rock and roll side might be so saturated that
you know they're trying out this and we've gone country and western dancing before and
but and it when i don't i don't dance i mean country dance that well but
you know just watching the people when they get out there is when they start playing the rock and roll music while the band's taking a break
you know i mean they get out there and jitterbug and or you know whatever you want to call it
and so i think there's a lot of people out there now that aren't just johnny cash fans or you know or
i don't even know what the
um-hum
yeah
i saw previews of it and it looked more like a rock and roll concert than a
yeah
yeah
and there's still some out there like that too
yeah i do too i do too
um-hum
um-hum
what do you listen to radio
yeah i switch around
well it's funny because my father i'm youngest of six and we all
play some type of music interest instrument and i had a couple of brothers that were in rock and roll bands and
so forth so you know he was constantly having to grow up with us so at christmas or his birthday we're always buying him
tapes you know to keep
okay well basically my habits are totally gone i used to exercise quite a bit and now i have a child and trying to do go to school back to college again so it's
they sure do yeah my daughter
yeah she's three so three with a i think it's almost like she's got this endless
energy i mean it's no longer nap time that kind of thing so
yes yeah so
yeah
exactly so the exercise we can pretty much get from her she always wants to go outside and do things so i'm kind of she's an only child too so it's not like you can say go out and play with other kids so it's
um-hum sure
yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum sure
um-hum -ure
sure
yeah that's about what basically if we can get out and take a walk it's
it's great but most of the time we can't so it's we're too busy doing other things but that also takes into account of walking though when you think about it so it ah
oh sure
sure
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
to loosen it up yeah that's true
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
so oh boy
sure trying to keep up with the nineteen months sure they're into everything
the baby hm
oh he was cranky
sure once you lose that sure that's very true
it wasn't too long ago where i was doing the same thing and that totally gets your mental capabilities thrown off totally when they're
tired and you wake up in the middle of the night and it's my daughter used to be pretty much on a regular basis for that so
so
um-hum
um-hum
sure well it was really nice talking to you then
okay um-hum thank you um-hum bye now
uh-huh
uh-huh
do you have has texas always had capital punishment or they ever had a period where they outlawed it
i see right from day one
i'd have to confess to you that i don't know what the i honestly don't know what the law in maryland is i think
we have
i think we have a capital murder law
i think that's probably the only crime for which you know capital punishment is meted out
it's basically you know it what is the net the net benefit to society if you execute someone for a particular crime versus say if you lock them up for the rest of their lives or something of that sort
and there probably be a few instances in which i would think that maybe it wasn't warranted
that's death right
and let's see texas uses death by lethal injection now right
oh i see okay i see
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
because it's
well because of its colonial you know background and then of course during the civil or during prior and during the civil war it was a border state you know with half the state northern and half the state southern you know in sentiment and so forth
i suspect that like most states you know in the nineteenth century and so forth that they certainly had capital punishment
it's not a quaker state or something of that sort you know like you know pennsylvania
but
and i as i said i think we have a capital murder law on the books right now i guess my feeling you know i can set up some hypothetical cases where
well suppose there was you know a famous medical researcher who murdered his wife
you know now this you know the question is well what are the prospects of this medical researcher making medical break throughs that might benefit human beings in the future never mind that he murdered his wife
right you know and i think i'd have to sit down and say well what kind of contribution would they make and also what
do you i think another element in it in it is what kind of society do you what message are you trying to send to society i mean like the
i'm actually in favor of things like if you're going to execute somebody you i don't see any reason why they shouldn't televise it you know or what have you it's
it you know people ought to be aware of what it is that you know what it is that they're doing and you know what the sentence really means
when you know if you sentence somebody to death this is what it really means just like they show you what prisons are supposedly like
they pardon
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
sure
okay
drug testing doesn't bother me
no i've been drug tested twice at ti and it doesn't bother me
why does it bother you
i know i understand
well that's true i agree that there should be something done about people that drink alcohol because i'm sure that there's people that drink and come to work especially on a second shift or third shift
so i agree with you there but it just and it and it probably is an invasion of privacy
do yeah okay
that's true
i can remember the you know there's nothing worse than a hangover i have to agree there nothing worse
than a i can remember staying in bed a whole day from a hangover and not going to work but i that was years ago and i didn't work for ti so but you know really and truly
there's nothing worse than a hangover and you're right and you cannot perform well
that's true
course through this i think that they've helped a lot of people also
a lot of people have ended up going to treatment you know which is offered i think at most government places i know it is at ti do you work for ti
okay well you know a lot of people have used that treatment and i center and that's probably been a good thing especially for cocaine abusers and stuff
yeah
yeah
that's true
that's true
yep
well
of
getting caught and of course the first time you get caught it's not that big a deal you have to go to treatment and that
oh i didn't know they took you off the job
wow
now i would have thought if he'd have brought in the wife prescription and explained the situation that they might have let him off of that
they didn't
okay
yeah
now see that i wouldn't agree with see i think you got to be able to bend the rules a little bit
here and there too without you know if it's a case like that because look how many people take their husband's or their wife's
medication you know but that's a really good example
yeah and so i would think that either the doctor could get him off with that or that they should listen
i mean because i just can't see that they would do some make somebody go to a rehab or whatever they go through because he took his wife's medicine that just doesn't sound right does it
on that but you but i don't know because i don't know anybody that's had to go through treatment or anything so i really don't know
you know
ooh
oh that could have been his whole career down the tubes
so does alcohol show up in these tests
so it wouldn't show up yeah well it's not that's true see there's the there it is right there it's not illegal
and drugs are illegal so i guess if they made drugs legal or marijuana legal then we the we wouldn't be going through this
you know they wouldn't be testing
which doesn't make any sense either because they say you know it has no place on the job and you can't work safely under the influence of drugs and stuff like that
and so if it was made legal
get hurt yeah
oh gosh i was one of the first ones to go i think
the with the january that they started it up i got called
so i was one of the first ones but did you get tested when you got hired
okay so you were well i got tested before i got hired too so
but
hum
i quit drinking at oh a long time ago quit drinking i didn't i don't smoke i gave everything up
oh i have a lot of friends that just are smoke just you know occasional joint at a party or something
you know and i'm even afraid to be around it
because i'm afraid what if it gets you know because you can inhale it if you're if a room full of it
into my bloodstream
yeah and with my luck there'd be the notice monday you know go take your test and that would scare me
how can you prove it
no not many people could i go paycheck to paycheck barely
so
well this has been interesting
but
huh
sort well sort of i mean i agree with a lot of what you said
oh i see that's how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it
well i don't work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than what's coming in i have to go back to work so i manage
well that's pretty much the way we do or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our children are grown
and so i really don't have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to
you know get things together for them
and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses
are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and i try to keep my mastercards and things paid currently
i don't always succeed at that i usually keep one with a low interest rate and i'd put things on there that i think i'm not gonna give to
and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home and they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to
so i'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead
and we do not buy ah new cars do you get into the car
we do for us very much so in fact we
are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever and i said
look you guys are all into car payments we haven't had car payments for so many years i love it this way
and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked
and it has eighty two thousand miles on it and we were kept saying boy wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it
believe it or not we did we found one newer the worst part is it's the same color
i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and it's an eighty five
and so i said hey this was a cinch we've paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on
generally from dealers and it depends because i don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual
unless we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know we were going up to a larger one
but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying
don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get one shot at us
we will you know
and they say well you're kidding you know i no this is the price we're going to give you out the door we don't wanna hear about taxes
hi nancy well do you do a lot of dining out
uh-huh
well we do some dining out i do a lot of cooking so
mostly like when we go out you know it's my husband and i we don't go out too often as a family unless it's like a fast food kind of thing
but we do enjoy dining out one of our favorite places here in the dallas area is atlantic cafe i don't know if you have you ever been there
have you now that's down in highland park it's highland park village did you like it
uh-huh
oh it is it's fabulous it really is good
atlantic cafe is down on i believe it's on mckinney
and originally the two the guy who owns the cafe pacific and the guy who owns the atlantic cafe were partners in the atlantic cafe and then they separated and the guy started cafe pacific
and i loved them both i really do i think they're wonderful
that's our favorite you know what we'd really like if we just have a casual evening is houston's have you been there
it's wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there for an hour waiting to get in and
as long as you know that it's okay but they have i think one just about the best prime rib
uh-huh
uh-huh
was it
really i've been there for like you know lunch but i've never been there for dinner and it was good yeah
oh that's great that's great another nice place for prime rib is baby doe's
maxwell's nice have you been there
is lawry's i've heard that's real good lawry's prime ribs
i've never been there but i've heard it's real good
yes actually they have one in richardson that i've been to they have real nice lunches have you have you been there for lunch or yeah
really
really
uh-huh
the specials
have you been to biffin's
i keep hearing about it i keep hearing the advertisements of it and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful i have not been over there and i was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place
over near plano super bowl and i've not been there
i've been there
that was nice
oh i've heard of it where it's made it's like it's like a it's all chocolate like made like a paper bag and it's filled with what whip cream and strawberries and something
yeah
oh
oh
oh i bet it was i bet it was
the last time we went to cafe pacific it was father's day and we took another friend with us and
berry assortment it was it was raspberries and blueberries and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom
and you know they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the you know how they do the
plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it and it was outstanding it was really relatively simple but oh it was good it was really good
i was home a few years ago and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and i was really amazed you know the restaurants up there were kind of quaint you know they were real
real pretty
but they lacked the service and they lacked the just the i don't know the restaurants down here seem like they have
i guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good
and i thought i would really miss that
uh-huh
ooh really
oh yes i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them
uh-huh
there's a big difference there
but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline
uh-huh
oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way at least that's for me
yeah
but yeah i've talked to some who's really had some bad experience and kind of knock on wood i haven't yet not bad you know i just i'm just shocked at the end of the month
to see what damage i have did but
i try to keep it pretty reasonable
uh-huh
yeah
huh
and then they have bad drawbacks too i mean high interest it's like paying twice
yes
so but
oh uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh yes we used to have you know like several but right now we're just more or less at american express you know and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in
yeah
pay fifteen yeah yes i know yeah and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time
it sure does
uh-huh
but yeah
uh-huh
yeah well i've enjoyed talking to you
and maybe we'll get to talk again okay bye-bye
okay i'm back on
you say you watch evenings mostly
um-hum
oh so
do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there
which ones
oh
that's a
oh two they're going to change well one they're taking off i don't know what's going to yeah we like l a law we don't watch thirty something but that's kind of young for us my husband and i are grandparents so we don't watch
that type of show but we like l a law we like that we're just i'm sorry they're breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there
i'm not sure i like the new ones too much
i just wonder if they just want to go on to
other projects and not be
stuck in this show since it's gone on for so long it looks like it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things
where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show of course i guess that's not bad alan alda did it on mash and
it hasn't hurt him at all so do you do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour
right which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention
yeah that's always a bummer too sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one
we do that sometimes i guess i'm not into real heavy stuff l a law is about the heaviest thing i watch i i'll mostly i'm into it for relaxation
so i like things like golden girls or cheers or monday night is real good with me you know major dad and northern exposure and oh what's that one with burt reynolds
that type of show is what we what we watch we generally just stay on one channel all for all of monday night just to watch those
just some of the times they're continued but mostly they're just little vignettes a new one we found we really like is that dinosaurs have you seen that is it's really funny they use
like animated it's not like a cartoon but it's like dummies and things that are used and it's really and robots probably but there's always a moral to each story
well you we watched it the times we've seen it it's been like on or excuse me friday night but it's we've only seen it a couple of times but it
it's real the first one we saw they were it involved a tradition
of when a person reaches seventy five and i can't remember what day they call it but
anyway it goes on you know and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all and then when it comes time for him to throw her over well the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her
and she said no you can't do you know he ran her out was running to in a wheelchair to hide her and she said you can't do that this is
tradition this is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the cliff and he said i don't understand it's real funny that they give the teenagers
the as the one that questions the what's going on and in the end of the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff
the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says no you can't do it and then and then oh well we've got to do it it's tradition and the son was you know why and so in the end he doesn't throw her over and of course the town thinks he's just terrible
because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and
he's broken it and then we saw one where this there was a teenage
when a teenage boy comes into his manhood they call it the night of the howling or something like that and they all go out and howl you know
and the son refused to do it he did he thought it was not no he wouldn't go howl so all the all the people that worked with the father ostracized him
it is it it's real interesting to watch the show and the relationship between the family is really now the
now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them so it's our grandson our oldest grandson is the one that got us to watching it but it really is
it moves real fast it's a real short and there's always like i say a moral to it and half hour that that's all there is to it and they
yeah it's it they they're trying to liken the father in there of the teenage son to like jackie gleason show
the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth and i guess maybe there are some parts of that but i didn't really see that in there but what i've read about it they
talk about that but anyway we've enjoyed that and i guess mostly i like the news shows too and the news magazines like sixty minutes or twenty or
prime time live or something like that you know all of those shows if i if i can do it but my husband likes to watch
old movies especially war movies or sports which i'm not
no i don't well i do i like ice skating and i like gymnastics
and some track and field but i and i'll watch snippets of baseball games and i just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing
and i don't ever no matter what's on i don't ever just sit and watch tv i'm usually either doing dishes or i may be sewing or you know i always have or letter writing or i may be working around in the room somehow but i don't
i don't ever just sit and i that's something that comes from your old age you know idle hands are the devil's workshop no it's
right
right
yeah our oldest grandson pulling his tooth he's he wouldn't let us pull it and i mean it got to the point he was eating a pear here and he bit into it and it was just hanging by a thread
and i and i'd tell him you know it's getting ready to fall out and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it
why do i think so few people vote i
i think a lot of it is apathy
for example when things are going good i think the voter turnout is less just because people
figure why bother you know what's the difference especially when two candidates seem roughly equal
and in others cases you know they see themselves as one voter in a million and they think what difference is it going to make whether i vote or not they feel like one vote doesn't have an impact
and i think a lot of cases like a lot of our
minority issues the we had the ten four one verses the fourteen one election here in dallas a while back
and it lost well that was decided by a very small margin
and there were a lot of minorities that wanted it to go
the way that it didn't go
but they also had very low voter turnouts especially like in the hispanic community
and i think in that case they've just they developed a distrust of the system
and so they've chosen not to participate in it
and i think that's part of it
what do you think
oh
i've heard people say that i know it's a real thing and i think it makes a difference
as to how many people vote apparently not being a citizen not serving on jury duty is important enough to them that they don't want to have any say
in politics
yeah
yeah
well
last november was my first election in dallas i've only lived in dallas a little over a year
and i went down this long list of judges that i was voting for
and
i mean i didn't know anything about any of these races i didn't know what the responsibilities of the judges were i didn't know anything about the individuals who's names were on the ballet
and i'm going you know how can i possibly make an informed choice here
so what's the point in voting for these people i mean it you know i get just as good of results as if i through darts at a board
um-hum
yeah you think then that part of it is because the it flashes too much on the personal characteristics of the candidate rather than his
job performance issues
um-hum
yeah
i'd say
yeah i'd say there's a large number especially of urban young voters that don't know what the railroad commission does
and so they go you know who what does it matter who i vote for
i think well that's one thing i've noticed i've lived a couple of different places i've noticed texas seems to have more elective offices than any place i've ever been
well a lot more confusion you know i in other towns i've never been called upon to decide all this long list of judges i've never been called upon to decide
we wouldn't be expected to cast a ballet on the subject
well it does
um-hum
but it also means you've got a unified state government you don't have different departments pulling against each other
yeah
yeah
the big problem i guess with the mass media is you know
i mean anything that can't be covered in thirty seconds or less they're not going to care about it
or if you can't dramatize it and put it on unsolved mysteries then they're not going to you know they're not going to want to hear it
the line what i waited maybe ten minutes in line
it was a minor inconvenience it was certainly
worth it to me i think
i went right after work so that was when the line is the longest
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
hum
so you have to go a little out of your way huh
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah i would also like better
information on
on what on you know what am i voting on and who some just general statements about the candidates i guess this is the kind of thing you expect from the newspapers
and i didn't see much of it
like you know i you saw a lot about the major races but a lot of the minor ones that you're being called upon to decide there's very little information on
as far as you know what is the duties of this political office and what are the characteristics or what are the
issued statements and
spoken goals of the candidates
i'd like to get
yeah
um-hum
yeah well they the dallas morning news did publish a section that covered the major races and it explained a lot to me about the individual candidates and helped me make a lot of
better informed decisions
but still
you know it left a lot of the local races the races unique to my precinct
up in the air there is one thing that did annoy me and that is the my congressman last fall didn't have anybody running against him so basically i had no choice
and i think
in some districts you know there's a party one party or another that has such a lock on it
that you know why vote when it's decided already
that sort of attitude
yeah
well we used the five minutes up
okay
all right bye
okay basically i work for the government and our health insurance plan seems to be okay but it seems the benefits are eroding and the cost of insurance goes up
i don't know why the post people post office people pay one third out of their paycheck for the same insurance that we're getting
right now i'm in we're physicians health plan and that costs about thirty five bucks a paycheck
but yet the postal people will only pay less than ten dollars a paycheck
um-hum
gosh yeah that's a steep one
um-hum
i agree there because i you know saturday afternoon you're playing baseball and you break your arm you don't know what it's going to cost you for the x-rays and everything else like that if you don't have some type of health plan that you can afford
and i know i and when i was in germany i was in the service but at the same time there was an agreement that if you went to a hospital there in germany that they knew they could bill uncle sam for that hospital care
and my brother and my dad are over there and it's a great health insurance plan for them
i think that's going to cost us money as far as taxes if our government gets into it because they all haven't shown a real good record for management of any kind of program
i'm pretty ignorant on taxes but on self-employed do you get any kind of credits for health insurance
you know the consumer is going to pay in the end no matter what happens so
well i know in some of the one of the smaller towns around dallas they started curbside recycling
and that's going really well because they i think what goes on is they get like
they get charged not by the amount of trash they do well they get charged by for the pick up of the trash and not for the recyclables
so it's so you get you pay less to have your trash picked up if you presort all out all your all your recyclables
what are they doing out there
wow
um-hum
right
um-hum
and it's hard to find i know at least here it's hard to find places that recycle and so many things are recyclable like shampoo bottles and water bottles
but no place will take them
and you know i mean they're real specific you know you can do your newspapers but you have to take all the slick stuff out
you know and well what do you do with the slick stuff
i mean they're so specific i mean in i know in dallas they're having a real hard time right now because the drop off sites
people aren't there's a you know what they say that a couple people can mess it up for everybody
and there's some people that are not sorting out like their slick stuff out of their newspapers and all their plastic bottles or their brown glass out of their clear glass
and the companies that recycle the stuff won't recycle it then
and they'll just trash it so all the effort goes downhill
really
that is great
gee i didn't i just thought there was something in the slick stuff that made it so they couldn't recycle it well that's great
oh okay
um-hum
yeah
right i know well i know here at i i'm in i'm in college and
we have more than one campus and i'm on the kind of like an off branch campus
and on the main campus they've got a company that comes in and takes out all the recyclables all the copy paper and all the cardboard i mean everything that's recyclable
hell air pollution tends to be a topic that
some people have a lot to say on and some don't care much for it at all but i found that there's there seems to be quite a bit that the individual can do as far as air pollution and one thing
it kind of hits the old pocketbook a little bit but if you can just keep the automotives vehicles going properly instead of letting them rundown and use a quart a oil a mile like some of these smoke cars do
that would make quite a difference we all seem to have one or more of those things and then we have a variety of people at least in this part of country that love their fireplaces
and we burn off an awful lot of acreage of wood and put it up in smoke and on a
proper day as far as the temperature goes you can have a cloud of smoke hovering other a neighborhood that's just sickening really i mean it may be pleasant inside but it stinks outside
so little things like that an individual can do what else do you think they can do
yeah that's true
yeah that's true
um-hum
no
um-hum
um-hum
make it
right
um-hum
that's true yeah
right
um-hum
right
right it may not be us yeah we have a they happen to use about the same abbreviation for the dallas area they use dallas area rapid transit for dart and
dart's problem the you know the metroplex itself suburbs and all it's a pretty hefty distance from one suburb to the southern suburb so they run
they gather the monies from the other counties and the other suburbs and run the dart system throughout the suburbs to downtown dallas as it were and it's a good
forty or so miles in each direction just about and they also try to run city to city with you know around locally the only problem is for me to go to work i live
less than ten miles from the front door of my place of work and for me to get there
texas instruments thirty thousand people in the whole area right and then my building inside it's fairly large and there's no reason for me to have to go from point a to point b in an hour and a half
when i can roll that old beast of mine down there for a lot less than that
plus it would cost me oh i think the last time i looked at it was about had a dollar fifty one way
and i said no i'm not going to do that fast isn't that bad yet
so that part's one problem i wonder about the whole cfc issue i've read some papers from some
some scientist that don't get published that well because of their opposition to that saying that they're really not sure that the cfc's are the main problem yes we have a ozone problem but is it
um-hum
um-hum
well they weren't negating
um-hum
that's interesting
that's interesting
great
huh
um-hum
right
yeah it seems like i heard that just this week on either cnn or somewhere that they were talking about that
yeah
right
yeah
um-hum where do you live
okay i'm from pennsylvania
right exactly
okay
well i like a lot of folk music and jazz and different sorts of experimental music
yeah some stuff that you could call new age let's see i like cherry riley a lot
and okay let's see well who do you like from that category yeah say
new wave all right okay well who do you like that i mean
okay
yeah i'm not i'm not that crazy about the bauhaus i liked joy division a lot and
oh maybe right
um-hum
right let's see and
um-hum
right
okay
um-hum yes i think
right least the jacksons i can agree with you
um-hum yeah you like stuff like prince
and
his what
okay let's see yeah i think i heard that
once i like what i've heard of the new album
his
like what
um-hum
yeah well that's very good have you heard dirty mind
oh that's a that's a fantastic album it's even
earlier it's one of those where he's playing all the instruments and it's actually pretty brilliant a lot of it's like the dirty side of his stuff
but that's all right too
um-hum
right well
yeah well i think that kind of happens for
a lot of artists i mean you could say the same sort of thing about
right and no it seems that a lot of people a lot of christians seem to sort of walk the line between
you know total depravity and
you know and religion and asceticism you know
what
i'm twenty six
yeah
acoustics
right
okay yeah no i'm in engineering basically
but i'm very interested in music anyway i play some stuff and i'm a radio dj and blah
well just
i worked for a radio station as an undergraduate just the college radio station and had
had to goshen college which is in indiana
and i found it
to be a very
good experience i mean besides having access to millions of records i liked being able to control the airwaves you know
and so now i'm just working for the campus radio station at penn state where i am
oh yeah well i'm into it
really
oh wow
right
super yeah that's kind of the way i did it too actually i played just a tiny bit when i was real young and then i got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still
but and then quit for awhile and recently i picked it up like you say about a couple years ago and i've been playing you know off and on when i can up in minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course but
i actually live in florida so i'll be going back down there in may and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly
yeah that's true all too many times
fortunately down where i live in florida there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look
one of them is the university of florida golf course which is open to the public and that's pretty good
yeah
can you get like a student discount type of thing or
yeah what are greens fees run there
okay that's yeah that's about the same i guess as it is in florida but
really oh that's super
yeah uh-huh
well that's the way to do it though that's the way to get in to some good practice without having to pay for it all the time
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah i bet that would be great
yeah
but that's wild though i'll have to see if i can't get a chance to go
right
oh you are which university
okay all right great what are you going into
yeah if you're good you can really rake in the bucks what was that what was that movie that they had out
there was a movie about a professional golfer and i can't remember it was on network tv a couple times
yeah
but yeah i guess when i get i'm going to school in florida actually and fortunately i've been able to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful you know but
it's unfortunate you know you hear about japan i guess you know it's like
two hundred and fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to like to practice even insane
yeah
yeah i guess they have those driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of each other
they do yeah i played eighteen holes with some japanese guys in gainesville as a matter of fact
and it was really wild they were into it you know they kicked our butt all the way to
now are we off and
oh i was just saying i guess old age has a few compensations i don't have to plan as carefully as i used to but
no i don't think so we have three children and we were able to put all three of them through college and
yeah
uh-huh
well
the only way if you spend all you take in every month
you're living beyond your means
and emergencies or what we could would consider an emergency always come up
i don't care how you how closely you think you figured and then planned something always comes up
so when i guess we started by necessity because we went to law school on my husband's gi bill
back in the days when the government paid
the student's tuition and bought books up to a certain amount plus gave the veteran a stipend we started off with ninety dollars a month and then a little bit later got up to a hundred and five dollars a month
so there was no way that we could do except when we cashed our monthly stipend was to put twenty dollars a week in an envelope
deciding that it was better to go without one day a week than for four days at the end of the month
and then later on
and
so we had already established the envelope habit and
no this was our weekly budget
but we realized very early on that if we were going to have money to buy cars and that sort of thing that we would have to save up beforehand
so
we
began in nineteen fifty to pay cash for everything we bought a car in nineteen fifty and paid it off in three months
so since then except for a house
houses we've paid cash for everything and to illustrate how well that works so that you have the opportunity to take care of special pricing
our headquarters was transferred from south carolina to texas one time
and because texas gas was much cheaper to cook with than electricity
this one couple that we were transferred with bought a gas stove
a very simplified gas stove for a hundred and forty some odd dollars
we had in storage and used just a little teeny gas stove but after we got to waco
we saw an ad in the paper one day where a lady who had was moving into a house with a built in oven had
the very best stove that sears made at the time with two ovens a grill in the middle on top clock all the fancy amenities
and we were able to buy it for a hundred dollars
because we had the cash
and
the
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
for some reason or other my husband didn't see fit to give the boys a meaningful allowance he just felt he had to keep control of the purse strings
and when they went off to college they had never really budgeted
and that was a big mistake so even though you know your children are going to make mistakes
i don't i don't know how to tell you
yeah so what do you feel about the universal health insurance issue
um-hum
i guess my initial reaction would be that i would be for it mainly from the standpoint that i find my health insurance not very effective and very expensive
and so i you know am probably being very naive i'm hoping that by centralizing it might get better and be cheaper
um-hum
what about things like in sweden isn't that sort of a centralized or in lots of places in europe
um-hum
um-hum
right i you know i guess i can certainly agree with that
but
you know like i said i feel i'm being stung every time
oh i see
um-hum yeah i knew they had one but i just i guess i assumed it worked which is not a good
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
right
um-hum maybe i don't know much about hmo's but my impression is maybe some hmo's are sort of a low form of centralization
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum is that because of the cost or government wants it you think
um-hum
um-hum
well
well but that's interesting because you know it's i don't know that much about it but my initial response would be more favorable and perhaps i need to learn more about it so that i'm not so naive on it
uh-huh
right well it was nice talking to you okay um-hum bye-bye
mine are too but i think it's a real a real serious situation for a lot of people
and i don't you know a lot about it where you're working for this school department
leave the school uh-huh
um-hum
well you're probably in a more oh we live in a rural area
and so i think most of the people around here that have to leave their children leave them with neighbors or people you know in a home situation
so
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
have you worked all the time your children were little
oh uh-huh
so but that's about the time then they could go into a preschool situation
oh
uh-huh
oh
oh yes you know i don't know how people we it's pretty cold here in utah in the winter and i just think it would be so hard to have to get a child up a baby
and take it in the cold to someone early in the morning
i think that i would let i think i would sooner have it in someone in the home taking care of it
in a home
oh yes uh-huh to come into your home but i
um-hum
yes unless you can get could get a nanny or something that i know a lot of the girls here go off as nannies
and stay in people's homes and take care of them after they've graduated from high school not a lot but some of them
but i think that'd be an ideal situation i've never had to work out of the home i've had we had six children and they just
children's spouses and i have five boys and a girl and
so but we have fourteen grandchildren so
this i feel lucky that they have not had to go out of the home
so
it's in the how cold is it honey right now
about twenty eight
is it still raining
oh good are you
um-hum
what do you do in the school district do you
so
uh-huh
you have the ability and stuff that's great there were times when i would have loved to have got you know uh-huh to have left my kids and you know
i'm sure they do
the roles that women have played the last couple of year in our are couple of generations
you bet
you bet you know where i've noticed it more i think is i'm a traveling salesperson and i have traveled most of my life and i know just especially in the last
oh ten years and really since the in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling
you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers i sell sporting goods and even in our industry
there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell and even in the last five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved and
you know it's a it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things
you bet
you bet that's sort of neat
sure i think it's the age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on tv or something where the discussion comes out that
you know women are paid less than men and they're and they're doing the same
or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that's a very true statement and it shouldn't it shouldn't be that way
and
i think so hope so
you know i've
right yeah they forget also i think a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know
if a woman congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever
so they certainly they certainly deserve it all the way
but i guess just the most significant change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling you see more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and in their business suits and going
and i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now that's a good a good statement
and i think if in the future it's even gonna be more noticeable and more significant
wow
you bet
right now i'm self employed and my wife's always worked she's a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when i first started my bidness she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so
you know she certainly did her part in help getting me established in my business and she still works everyday so
you bet
well good
right married
yeah
well
trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject
you see the old
baby right and you think about this when you coming to a when it comes to a subject like that and
it's really true women have come a long way and you know
the basic question is too much
and
i don't know my opinion i guess here in north carolina they announced that may second was the tax day that's when you everything you've earned so far has gone to taxes
the rest of the year is yours
that represents about a third of your income
and i don't know who came up with that figure but i think it really comes out to be more than the third
but i don't know i find myself in a position sort of like selective
approval almost like the united way campaign where you agree with most of the agencies but don't agree with some of them
and
i think that we could have less tax
by cutting out some of the
the
programs that we support
but overall i guess we're pretty fortunate nature nation as far as the amount of tax that we have to pay how do you feel
yeah i've done some business overseas in latin america and of course know about the we hear about sweden with their
social program but you don't hear what the cost is same in britain and other nations much higher tax rates
but the
oh yes
oh yes that that's the type of thing that really irritates me where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs or cutbacks or
equating it to a personal income situation
and yet it's almost automatic or it's hidden and
i think they need to bite the same bullet that most individuals do
the one of the other problems that i have recently is
centered on such things as the trip by dan quayle to augusta georgia to play golf
and i realize that constant communication is necessary
especially when bush had his
heart rhythm problem this weekend but
we can always send jets for someone i think if they're out of pocket
rather than accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip
so that's what i meant about the selectives some things i think we're doing extremely wrong could save a lot of money
but other things
like i enjoy seeing money spent on the smithsonian institute in washington i think it's one of the nicest national treasures and i love to see
kids of any background roaming through and seeing such great collections
but
then when we talk about all the foreign aid that we give away
that bothers me a lot
i don't know how to solve the problem though when as you said the bureaucracy gets out of hand regardless of who you vote for
the bureaucracy continues too
uh-huh
oh i think it's way
which is not a good attitude in global communications and everything that we have this these days but it's a matter of
i hate to see money thrown away and that's what i equate to some of our foreign aid policies
and they
i agree i think that's
i have some problem with social programs at home in terms of making it too convenient to be on welfare
oh yeah i think when you get to a point where it's more economical to stay on welfare than it is to get a job you've got a basic concept problem
yeah
than overseas too and that there's some unusual
things which can occur in the foreign aid
by a stroke of a pen i think our president can forgive foreign debt and that's a lot of power vested in one
one person in our system of
governance
and i've seen that happen
over the last few years and you and i are paying for it
but jim it comes back a lot to the same thing that you said initially you've been overseas and have seen
other places
and i guess we're still fortunate but i think we're i just want us to be smarter
than we are
uh-huh
yeah well your neighbor to the north oklahoma just voted for state legislators one term
no let's see
i forget was it one term or two term
fixed
incumbency in other words they can't be reelected after
i think maybe the second term
federal
yeah
yeah i think it takes away the issue of a lot of the special lobbyist groups and everything else
creating the incumbent
about
invincibility
but
but it i guess it's hard to really
identify which are the good and which are the bad
the electorate seems to be putting them all back in
and i thought this last election would be different but it turned out it really wasn't
uh-huh
it doesn't solve the non elected bureaucrats either that's
that's an issue i think that really fits into it because there are a lot of people that sit
in the same position and really don't give a hoot who gets elected
they still kind of run the show and setup all the roadblocks and the
the
horrendous regulations and everything else
but it's
it's our system i think now we have to figure out how to really manage it well
uh-huh i think that's right
well
yeah how do you feel about the information we get
from congress that affects us as far as the
knowledge to elect the right people
i have i have a real problem federal register for instance
you can have almost put anything in there you want to
no it's not in the federal register what's the congressional record
someone can put in information retroactively to that to show that they supported something or
yeah it
and
we just bought our first home after being in school and so we're just first time homeowners who've only been living here about six months
oh boy
uh-huh
oh so you're an old pro then
um-hum
well what do you find having to be like out there i've always heard that it was expensive
um-hum
oh really
hm
well we when we graduated from school in houston my husband went to school at rice and got his phd so that that's what brought us here and we had
heard a lot about richardson being a good area and the homes there being really nice and but we kind of just got the impression it was out of our price range
um-hum
yes
um-hum
really
hm
yes
well that makes sense
um-hum
hm
oh that's good
well do you have a lot of homes out there that have foundation problems that seems to be the pretty much the rule out here
hm
uh-huh
um-hum
yes
oh
um-hum
we really like our school out here
but we
we were scared to buy a an house
in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems and we didn't know you know if we were afraid we'd be living there and all of a sudden the house would crack in half and split open or something
um-hum
hm
um-hum
well that's good well that's really good well our house is older it's like a nineteen sixty three
house that we bought so i'm not doesn't seem like it i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years
it's slab
um-hum
um-hum
well that's good
yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good deal so
well i appreciate that information about richardson i know it was it's got a really good reputation and
fourteen years that's pretty good well thank you and well you good luck with this program then bye-bye
let me ask you do you think the soviet union is a still a threat to the united states
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
well i think there's a
a struggle within the soviet union
hey maybe this communist thing isn't working
right
that's right i think
well that could be you know what i we always we think of the kgb and we think such bad things you know but i wouldn't doubt if the soviet people think cia and they think such bad things you know
oh yeah they do you know
thank you
i think if we can get that propaganda thing because i'm sure both countries are seeing it you know thinking kgb and cia and all that but
just on an economic point of view if the soviet union doesn't do something fast they're they ain't gonna be able to feed their people this winter you know but
with other nations' problems when we have so many at home yet
right
right
that's right
you know we've got
we've got quite a few domestic problems that
that i feel we ought to be concentrating more on i think the problem is and on the international scope
maybe the president feels that
you know for long term relations with all these countries it's important and well we'll always have the united states and you know we need to solve these international problems but
i've think i heard in the news about last week sometime that
the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on them on a
domestic issue because the american public's kind of getting fed up with it
right
right
yep no
that's right that's right
well i think
i think in the long
oh
really
oh yeah
okay
no i don't watch that in the i did watch it in the beginning when it was new and it was kind of funny a couple of times and then i don't i don't watch it
yeah
yeah
yeah well
it was just for a kick i know
yeah but look at the soap operas
didn't even know what was ever on and then this year for some reason i have a twelve year old and for some reason we've just gotten real comfortable with these little sitcoms at night
oh just the little funny things we love full house and
you know i just
yeah it's mine too and i
uh-huh did you see it a couple weeks ago when they had her fifth birthday that was so precious
it was and i hadn't realized that she'd been on the show that the show had been on that long that she was so tiny
yeah
right
right yeah i know who he is i don't watch it i don't like it very much
yeah i just never i never got into it and it might be the time that it's on and i'm not sure when it's on but
um-hum
i'm not home a lot but
really i never got into it very much and my daughter loves quantum leap and i hate that show
oh he's so it's such a strange thing have you ever seen it
it's he changes he has a little buddy that's sort of like a conscience or something i'm not sure and he goes to a different time
you know a time in the past it's sort of like a back to the future theme and he goes back and he changes things
it's a i have trouble with it it's just a really ridiculous show i just hate it my daughter looks forward to it she likes it
oh can we do that we don't have to tell them i mean they don't tell us when to hang up
oh
child care or
are you
oh does she what
yeah i have
uh-huh
yeah it is my wife is teaches at this little small family owned one here in utah but
i don't know what do you think about it
they do actually there's quite a few and getting more and more seems like
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
play all day
so what was she looking for when she was out around
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well my wife i mean they have a prepared you know little school type lessons for them and stuff but
but the kids sometimes are so rowdy and want to be outside that stuff doesn't go over too well she
she's not too set on the whole thing i mean it's a job for her she has to take it but
she's not too she'd rather almost just get a somebody she knows you know personally and have them babysit her you know her kids
if she had to
um-hum
yeah
yeah her
yeah well that was and that was what really kind of scared us is because well we have a daughter and she goes with her but she's in a different class and my wife will poke her head downstairs and she'll see the lady screaming at the kids and stuff and i'm just going wait a minute you know i mean
she's a year and half you know eighteen months old
you can't be screaming at them too much but
it seems i don't know i was pretty
i'm not i don't like them i think
we just have one just a little daughter eighteen months and
i said i it's the only reason you know she the only reason we have my wife working is that she can work with her she can go to work with her otherwise it's
well we i think they usually charge about twelve bucks a day so i think we're pretty cheap i heard once that like out in boston it could be upwards of four hundred dollars a month and here you and yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
gee
yeah
but you know the kind of money you have to make to make that even worthwhile i mean you know to pay eight hundred bucks out of your income
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah i like the idea of having it on site something like that i think that's
yeah go have lunch with them and stuff like that but that sounds pretty cool
but
yeah hey well it's been good talking to you
all right see you later bye
i think that the middle east is of all the regions of the world the most volatile that we seem to be getting ourselves involved in
and
i'm not sure we're doing so with
oh clearly yes and
hum
well i feel that as far as us policy's been concerned while i understand a position in allied friendship with israel
i think that we've applied a lot of double standards in the legion in the past as far as dealing with the arabs versus dealing with the israelis and the expectations that we put on the
arab nations while basically succumbing to a very powerful israeli lobby in this country
and i think that the palestinian question is a key to a lot of problems in the region
and i don't think that this country's handled that well at all
um-hum
yeah
yeah i kind of anticipate that because you know we set the stage and how we've dealt with that issue in such a poor manner by basically you know
paying lip service to the palestinians in the past
i think that's up the stage for the end effect to for this revolution of islamic fundamentalism what seems to be sweeping
yep
yeah i
yeah
i suspect that we'll probably in with the demise of the soviet union formation of russia whatever ends up coming out of that
that probably the biggest problems we're going to have in foreign policy are going to have middle east in the future
i think that we're going to continue to see a lot more fundamentalist influence in the area it's been spawning for a long time
the more moderate states even including saudi arabia which is a very religious country islamic wise it's not allowed the fundamentalist to gain control
but i you know tunisia and now we have problems with sudan
and these places i think that you know we're just in the beginning here of what will probably sweep through i mean egypt's suffering the same kinds of problems with fundamentalism right now
the more nations that join with this kind of thinking in government the more stronger difficulty we're going to have
as a nation in dealing with the region because of our past experiences with the palestinians
yeah
okay
my first thoughts on capital punishment i the first thing i want to say is no
just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life
we are punishing someone for taking someone's life
or in some cases we are punishing -one a person for taking someone's life and so in effect we're committing that same crime
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
one thing i don't understand is the whole concept of death row
okay these people are supposedly i guess waiting to die
right okay and there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row and i'm not saying that
well i guess i am kind of saying what are we doing i mean i guess that's the same thing you were saying
what are we doing with these people
they're there we should either take some kind of action
or
take enough or go a different route but they're just
oh exactly
um-hum
um-hum
exactly
um-hum
right
and i guess i see both sides in that at the at the same time that i'm saying that you know we're committing the same crime
i also agree that i mean if there's somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough
to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time there was a case in dallas well i'm sure they haven't gone to court yet but
apparently two teenage boys held up a taco bell they put four people in a freezer and shot them all
now to me that is inhumane
and
for two people to be out in the world like that i don't i don't want them in my world
you understand what i'm saying i i'm
i mean i'm not for killing anyone
but i don't want these people around at the same time
exactly
um-hum
right
and
um-hum
right
right
um-hum and at and at the same time like you said it drains society
we i think we should be
we the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and keep these people in prison
that same money or half of that money could be used towards
rehabilitation programs of some sort something to get to put these people back in society but prepare them first
um-hum
um-hum
exactly
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum and you want people out of prison you want people to get jobs and live happy lives
but they can't just walk out of prison and do that they can't just walk out of prison and say okay i'm going to go a different route
there has to be some sort of
buffer in there some sort of program or and i know this costs money but it couldn't cost anymore money than we're already spending
um-hum
really how what can we do
oh goodness i mean you know everyone's trying to make it
you know in their own little world you know i'm trying to make it with my job and make you know myself okay and make my family okay
and it's so hard to you know try and
be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them
um-hum
oh yeah
right
and i i'm a broadcast journalist and so i feel like one day i probably will
write a book or something you know and some of these views will be able to come out i work at channel six
here i'm a i'm a news reporter
i've only been in it for a year but i get to see pretty much close up
you know a lot of things that happen that people don't see
i got to get to see a lot of crimes and i get to see you know people's
pain and things and so when we talk about
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
a service
yeah
but still you know we can't shut we can't
i don't i
i guess i would like to probably editorialize more
we have to just report what's happening we can't say well this is what i think about you know the situation sometimes
you really want to say that you really want to say what you think or what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone or you know
that's a
um-hum
especially when you are dealing with a subject like
capital punishment or something or abortion
or something where there's an no or yes side and you have your side and you have to report both sides
but you really don't want to because you have your side
yeah so sometimes that's hard but
um-hum
um-hum
all right well it was nice talking to you
okay bye-bye
oh
yeah sometimes
oh
oh
well actually that lead into a couple different things my dad worked with unions
for placing so he could really relate to what you were saying but
my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so even as a child i got to go
to a lot of different
kinds of musical events
i grew up in detroit and so we had opportunities for a wide range of things one of the
regrets i have is that i grew up with a house filled with classical music and music that i really loved but i never took the time to
find out who the composers were or it was just always there and there were certain things that
i liked so much but i still have trouble to this day sometimes i will recognize a passage but i'll have no idea what it's from or whose it is and over the last few years
and when my father lived with us i made more of an effort to learn but that's something that i
regretted but when you mentioned the band music my
son just started high school this year and has been in band since middle school but this was the first year
with marching band and i really enjoy band music it
oh what instrument did you play
oh i like that
yeah
what my husband tim played a trombone in high school and he also played in a band in college not marching band but
symphonic and that was
really the first time that i got to hear a lot of the
band music and some of the wonderful composers other than the traditional sousa and things that everybody knows and
so i've
yes
we
oh
yes
oh
oh gosh
god
yes
well he must have collected that over a period of years
hum
i was going to ask you and it seemed that there must have been a big gap i also have a brother who's thirteen years older and one who's nineteen years older you don't run into that very often
uh-huh
yeah
oh i'm glad you got to go and hear him in new york though that must have been
very special
oh
okay
do you wanna go ahead or
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
i do too i like the idea i see a lot more my children i have five children and they're all married
and i love seeing the men help the women so much and they both cooperate together oh and i think it's great
right
that's right that's right yeah i've always taught my men that they better clean up with their women and help them if they did that you know
and they're good about it but it is neat to see them all work together and a big thing though i see all that most of the
and i believe we'll see a lot more ceo's in companies they're having a fit about how little there are
and i think we'll see a lot more don't you of upper management
than we do now even
i think it'll escalate
and i think black women now if in fact i work at a high school
and my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple months and already promoted and she's very sharp and i think that in the ethnic
thing will be you know is a good thing now they're moving them up and they're sharp and they
so you're going to see a lot more of that in leadership i believe
um-hum
right
right that's a shame
yes yeah but they wouldn't know what they're doing
but i'm not big on subserving as far as
to the men at all but i never have gone along with that you know even far back but i was brought up pretty good in a home that
years ago my mother was that way the same my the our you know some people say oh the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs the inside jobs but we never were taught they had to do as much as we did so that was good
so that's i think that's good to keep the equal as far as
as not necessarily by sex type thing
you know you should be able to accomplish as much and i think the attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now
you see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you know you can do it if he can do it you can do it type thing
um-hum
um-hum
right what about politics on it
do you think the political scene
yeah
i'm real i'm kind of disgusted this year because i don't see many women into the political scene and i really think we should have more
political leaders in the women than we do up for and even for president and vice president this year there's nobody again i think they're all scared out after
oh what was the lady's name that ran a couple of i forget her name now but you know who i mean
yeah she took such a rough go of it and they their tax deal and
right but i wish they would get some more on i really was disappointed this year when i see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about
they i didn't see any of the women in there and that disappoints me
and right now i don't think we have too many in the forefront schroeder's about the biggest one in washington
congress woman
oh that's great have you ever been there
oh that's a perfect age for disneyworld
oh that's great yeah so we've been there a number of times and we're going next year we have a business trip every fall well we go on a lot of business trips i
i don't work well we do we go my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position he's in they don't care if i go along
so it's great i just kind of join up when it's something interesting and disneyworld is the one for a week next year
and it'll be at this time of the year and this year we're leaving matter of fact we're leaving next saturday for new orleans
have you ever been there
well you know we went there once in fact we had been in dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let's go to new orleans so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a
a project he's going to be and then i said well i'll go along i hope it's swimming season because it wasn't a tremendous thing not amount of things to do that i wanted to do there
it well and that's probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a mardi gras night planned
did you know that next week there's several tv shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary
well and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind
so well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go
oh that's
well i really i think travel when i heard my topic today i thought okay that's my that's my favorite
and really at our point of life our children are grown and it has just worked out really well with this
position he's in because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he's going
whether or not i decide to go along but i do like to travel and it's i don't mind the pool life at all during the day and i like to sightseeing and i love to shop
so it's
well and one of my very favorite is las vegas that i would have to say we both end up going to las vegas probably once every maybe year and a half
and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with continental
and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of continental and i said well now that we have all the miles we better start using them
so we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for
just kind of a quick trip when we normally go that way we like to go to california at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from texas
i think that's a good trip and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent
now we did what we sometimes do since we are in ohio and it takes a while just to even get to the
what i would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to colorado to denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through utah
and as far west as las vegas and then we returned through new mexico that you just mentioned and it was oh it was just great
oh i think that's the way to
did you hear our topic and it's in regards to discussing homes
yeah i'm settled in a place i've been in it for twelve years since nineteen actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy eight
in it's in richardson texas which is north texas or north dallas
how about yourself
yes nice area
are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or
oh boy
right
sure
no we're settled and
we're
oh gosh so we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to florida or somewhere closer to our families
no i'm from west virginia but everyone's my wife's parents are from the new york new jersey area
oh i understand you need very minimum of four and probably five
as far
right
it's tough to find a five and six room bedroom house isn't it
oh i know seems like when you get in that category you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever and it's that's an awful lot you know
right
matter of looking right
lot of people will buy a in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do or do something i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had there were seven kids in her family
and they converted the dining room and did this and that they always seemed to get along fine you know
oh sure
assign my wife that chore then i would let her narrow it down to three or four then i'd go look because
yes
why certainly
i'm in the sporting goods business i'm a manufacturer's rep i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies
uh-huh
well great
how was the you say you lived in the denver area before how did that compare with this area as far as housing prices
no kidding
hello my name is donna donahue and i'm calling from plano texas
hi yes i did
what about yourself
uh-huh
right
i haven't had a chance
uh-huh
is it isn't it set in a different era is it was it the in the fifties or in the
yeah that's right and with young kids in the house we just really try to screen a lot of the things that they
uh-huh
okay and what else is there's a lot of things that i just can't believe
that sometimes we'll sit and enjoy and it's really a very nice that was we dropped
hbo because there was just never anything appropriate on for the kids and now with renting videos so readily i mean you can just rent it if you really want to see it that badly
but
that's right and then and then they repeat everything so often too and or if it's on at ten at night well
uh-huh
i see i see
yeah
it that does that does seem high but
yeah once in a while bryan watch that but that is more for an older kid than the younger ones
i do too i had to try to tell my kids that you know we don't really talk to each other like that i hope we don't anyway to make sure they don't think well gee mom
look what their kid just said well but
or i'll suffer parcheesi or something with them
okay
do you have a large house or do you live in an apartment or like
uh-huh
uh-huh
well we have a pretty large home and it's larger than the average house you know in the area
but we need a large home cause there's twelve kids in my family so we have five bedrooms two kitchens two full kitchens we have
two and a half baths also
you know plus we have a full basement that's in a into a game room that's wall to wall carpeting
you know
we have it would be like a
i do not know i guess it would be like a family room other than from the playroom the playroom is where we watch all our tv and stuff but we have another room you know kind of like for company and stuff
let me think that's about all but it's all split level
yeah
oh i like ranch style houses
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
well how much land did you get with it
land
is it
we have almost an acre yeah it's funny because we have
a two stall garage right beside our house but you can fit four cars in it it's long enough you know you can fit four in
but that's kind of like another room on itself
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah well all our walls are white you know well they are plaster except for our you know in the basement the playroom and we have it's a real light brown you know kind of like a tan
it has different colors in it but when you first look at it just kind of looks like a brownish color you know it has like browns and yellows in it
yeah
real short yeah
yeah see well because we have so many with a real thick carpet with so many of us it gets worn down too fast so most of the carpet in our house is the short carpet
in fact well we just got our like where we where we have company and stuff we just got that recarpeted and we think it's
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
it's against the wall
it's down in the basement and it's kind of like in and enclosed little room by itself
my dad enclosed it off so you kind of go into another room to it
but we had to learn to keep like all the bedrooms are two floors above it and we had to learn to keep all the
the rooms were shut on the first floor for the hot air to get up to the bedrooms for like in the winter and stuff
yeah
but i guess do you have much mowing to do with yours then
yeah
oh
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
yeah well it well we have just an acre we
a later shift to where i don't have the family time when my husband gets home it's usually he's home with my daughter alone and then couple of hours later i'm home
i don't know i'm finding that more and more people that i talk to there's less and less family time available to them and it seems that business wise
in the business community or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family
so you know if you do have any time it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done
just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then plus try to have that relationship with your children
and it it's sometimes a very it's a it's a very hard juggling act
and
and she's growing fast and
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
sure
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
um-hum exactly
um-hum
sure
um-hum
yeah
sure
sure
sure yeah i agree to a
i think so too
in fact i spent the first three years at home with my daughter so i guess i felt fairly fortunate that i was able to do that and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in day care and i thought to myself how can a mother
place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks whatever the employer says you have to be back to work is basically when you have to be back to work whether it be six weeks or three or four but how these women must
feel to place their children into care and you know it's our society saying yes this you need this job
it's a little bit financial type thing because if you look all over in the other countries like europe and that their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are and that's part of it too but
like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties were staying at home with their kids
and then made the decision well jeez you know i'll go out and get a part time job got a part time job and then financially they got themselves into well i'll have the boat i'll have the car and it's nice
and really women past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too
because it is now our financial situations are as
it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now and
um-hum
sure i did it for three years and it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it
and pretty soon you know you're at the limit where you've got to say okay you've sacrificed for you know so many years at home and you're not getting any further you know along
and you have to make that decision to go back to work part time or go back to work full time and you have to make that decision and it's a tough one and i
um-hum
sure
well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility
until i think if we wait which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late
you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand
and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take
plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them
and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait -til i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile
um-hum
yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to
no we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out
and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to
yeah
i think so it's just because they have to you know
right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's a it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but
yeah
yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and
so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in iowa the state i'm from
i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay
ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back
you're forced to and you also don't see the litter there people just
it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called clearly canadian i don't know if you've tried it
and they have on the it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that
yeah well some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now
texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass
so
uh-huh
okay do they save like the paper they use like the office paper good because there is a lot of waste there isn't there
right
right
right
yeah
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton
you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am going to stick with downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business
and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that
yeah and i think it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it
and i don't know it just may overwhelm us
here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late
very little that's another thing and if you've ever know like i know amway i only use a couple things form amway that it says this is burnable material well
that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it
yeah
and then just like the glass bottles that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in texas and there's no place i can take glass to
so i still throw away a lot of glass
yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of
what kind of
besides your salary what's the most the thing that you would consider to be most important as a benefit
oh
have you ever worked for a large organization
oh okay
okay
uh-huh
yeah
yeah probably because you said retirement and that really has not even occurred to me once
uh-huh
yeah that's true
that's true
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
no what is that
no i hadn't heard of that
is that something that you should change from year to year
that sounds like it might be a really good idea
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well
i think the most important thing for me right now is really the medical coverage
i am in
in involved in a four 401k but i'm contributing such a such a small amount right now
just to go ahead and have the account open because
i just let's see i've been with this company for about three months and before that
we were
we're still in the process of trying to catch up
we were we were way behind financially and so haven't really quite managed to catch up yet
exactly and we're also trying to buy a house which complicates matters even further
yeah
no
yeah
yeah that's probably
uh-huh yeah that's true
well there's lets see what other
it seems like everybody has it used to be that they used to give like two weeks a year and now they give one week after the first six months
most of the time now they do the first week after the first six months so that if somebody really needs that time
they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and then have two
so it would work either way
probably five years i think
or seven
that's kind of far away
okay
i've got another call coming in
okay all right bye
well do you like to sail
yeah
well that
oh i love to sail i have a i was first introduced to it when i was in atlanta
oh gosh in the late seventies i had a neighbor who had a little seventeen foot day sailor that we used to go out on lake lanier north of atlanta just about every weekend in the summertime
and it was just more fun than a barrel of monkeys
and just loved it and then i don't know it i had never sailed before and i took to it like the
that was twenty five or so
and then i was transferred to houston
and as luck would have it one of my cohorts at work was partner with another guy who had a forty two foot tarten as a matter of fact he still has it and so i got to go sailing a lot
on that we've been down to corpus and over to i've been on the pensacola yacht race and just in a whole little bit of gulf sailing and it's spectacular i just it's one of my favorite very favorite things to do
well once you get out
you know just real light waves i mean it's varied from one extreme to the other but whenever you get out away from the shoreline out in the blue water and the you know the dolphin start swimming along beside the boat and it it's wonderful
because honey you know that there's a saying you know what's a sailboat it's a hole in the water that you throw money into
well the guy the guy my friend who owns the boat that's what he professes that he said yeah then he said
yeah it is
well oh yeah and i agree with you a hundred percent i mean i have after having sailed a little bit i just have no interest at all in a power boat and
and just have and i don't know just the whole you well and you're closer to nature too than having a big throbbing engine behind you
and i really do love it i've got my company has some a facility in aruba and i'm going down there in this spring and i hope to get a chance to do a little sailing down there
exactly yeah
so one of the things i think i may even try is you know the little sail board with the what they call it
wind sailing yeah whatever but
i don't you know i'm not quite sure if i'm ready to try that or not i
yeah
yeah
yeah and i have heard people talk that you know you almost have to have lessons and then it's really you know not easy to master those
it really does but again it looks like something that looks how it maybe like roller skating would be it looks like a lot of fun but not that easy to do
no i never have
yeah right
uh-huh
yeah right but anyway that's sort of the extent of my water sports but i do i find sailing just to be one of the best ways for me to get out and relax -nd
yeah i have considered it and at the same time it's
where i live in houston it's in order to really get the use out of it i would need to move down near clear lake closer to the water
and that would mean commuting up the gulf freeway every morning into downtown and i'm i live so close to the office that i'm just not
i don't know the idea of having to commute on a freeway in houston every day even as much as i would like to have access to a boat you know more often than i do yeah it's just not that
all right
okay so wally moon shots and all that
oh i saw them i was out there last summer i saw a game ned skeldon
is that the stadium
oh okay it used to be a race track
yeah it was that was impression i got when i was there so i almost okay
um-hum
think they're in for a odd year this year actually
they
oh he has okay i hadn't
oh okay
yeah well is that i mean with detroit i mean they can get away with one guy like that i mean if i if i were like if i were running detroit i would start building the team around fielder
i think their pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter
he's pretty decent pitcher he's
okay you know who he is then
yeah i
and you know saw you know saw the cardinals and cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before
yeah hoping they'll do it this year because having a kid
yeah seriously
doing
oh
oh bless your heart
well
yeah
well i knew that you were sick for our last meeting did you have that on top of the flu
oh goodness
bless your heart
well if you're feeling better now
bless your heart
um-hum
um-hum
well anything though to get some nourishment down you
um-hum
did you try to go to work today
um-hum
i know
um-hum
i understand
well you want to talk about fishing
and then maybe we can gab a little when we get through
all right here we go
susan what kind of fishing do you like
um-hum
oh
yeah
um-hum
for umpteen hours yeah that you know takes a lot of strength for that
i like the kind where i sit on the bank and watch my bobber and when it goes down i pull a fish in
that's the kind i like
what did you catch
well that's a big fish
that's wonderful
i've never caught one yeah
oh
exciting yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah i know
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
anyway
well i did and i'm currently consulting now so i'm with this you know a smaller organization so my benefits are
pretty basic
medical
i don't get any
profit sharing and stuff like that so
yeah
yeah what the current climate is i saw a little flyer and i thought it was interesting
is they are now offering
you know flex flexible benefits
where you have more control and allocate like you can
pay for vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can
can do other things and
they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits
so it sounds like they're going to get more
flexible to meet individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different objectives
yeah are you single
okay
but
no i i'm single i'm
never been married so
no i said i've never been married only i'm only twenty six so
and
so what are the most important benefits to you
uh-huh
the but the medical stuff itself
the health plan you're with it only covers fifty percent
ouch
that's the worst i've ever heard
it's usually the basic eighty twenty
besides your initial deductible that's what varies the most i guess
ha
yeah co-payments type stuff
yeah
well i think obviously i think the medical is the most expensive or it's the most important
coverage
of the you know you may not even go in
to the doctor for a long time but you know if something came up obviously you know to get covered is important
yeah
uh-huh how about any matching programs
you ever
you know what i mean where they contribute like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a 401k
is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent
okay
yeah
but that that's a nice i think that's an important benefit
i don't get that option i was at a company that had that and i
so
but
uh-huh
with an annuity
yeah
i the only reason i know a little bit about that is
when i was in school still
i was down in florida working and
during the summer
some how i got a hold of
involved in a marketing organization that marketed
replacing those whole life policies which aren't very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could
and
the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with an annuity and
they would you know analyze it
the person's current policy and get a computerized you know statement of
what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know what your benefits would be and the difference between you know the term life with annuity and the whole life
was you know there's fairly big discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved on that end
and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never did anything with it but
so i know a little about the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but
you know i don't know what i get out maybe twenty or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but i'm not worried about that i don't have anybody to
yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money to help anybody cover my end you know you don't want to be a burden to anybody else
and
so i think
yeah i mean i'm not looking to leave anything there may be a certain amount and you know that's fine but
you know to get that coverage and know that i'll get you know
you know flown to wherever i need you know already i need to go i guess i haven't made any decisions like that i guess you know my family and father would do that but
but anyway as far as benefits
what else is important obviously i think
a profit sharing is
is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term
yeah there's the smaller the companies it's either
the smaller company
you're in to into the consulting side and they'll you'll finish up a project and you'll get the little bonus that type of thing
i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing
but most you know most medium or small
probably don't
do that much profit sharing
and while i was at this other corporation they never had any profit so
i wasn't qualified for my first year something you know after
so
little over three years now
versus what
yeah
well how long have you been here
yeah
we've been here probably two and a half years and
and we didn't recycle at all before we came so i think we're doing well we we've saved most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now
they have in behind wal-mart they have bins
um-hum
there's a place on parker road it's just over the overpass before you get like to kmart i think there's a service station there there's usually a semi truck
that has a person there that will weigh them and
what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the pickup now and we hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of october
from what i've read in you know the mail that we get and i can't wait for that will be easy i get tired of newspaper littering the garage
i feel guilty we don't recycle our milk containers because they seem like a big waste
yeah they fill up the whole kitchen garbage pail so i'll be glad when the bins do come and i think that's when i'll start doing the plastic too
yeah
but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar
and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter you know the cans and that was kind of fun but we haven't done that for a long time
so
um-hum
right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the by the collection agency or the city
along with your garbage can you can put out newspaper you can put out glass you can put out aluminum cans you can put out certain types of plastic material
and that's on a roll out effort right now not all the citizens and the people in plano can go ahead and participate right now but
that will be rolled out to everyone i hope in the next year or so and those that aren't participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum
and i think overall that's an excellent opportunity because i hate to see our landfills being filled up and growing bigger and bigger and bigger
where they're becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today but for the future also
so
how about your community
dye mound
uh-huh
well i like it
well good
oh okay
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
well it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack isn't it
okay
yes until you release it
all right i think that's
yes
oh yes i sure do
uh-huh
um-hum
oh
yes
no
well great that's excellent
right
um-hum
right
oh
yes
well that's a great idea that's a great idea
product
yes
uh-huh
yes they will exactly
hm
yes well i've found out too that you know a couple years ago we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years
and at one time we could get a pretty good return with the boy scouts we could take and collect the newspaper an and
okay i work for a temporary service and so our benefits are a lot more limited than what you would have if you worked a regular full time job
we have to work a certain number of hours and then we get holiday pay and vacation pay and they if you
i could if i wanted to i'd i'm not right now
i have been
yeah you like you have to work twelve hundred hours within a year to get holiday pay and fifteen hundred hours within a year to get vacation pay so if you're not working enough hours to get that much time in a year
then you don't get the benefit
uh-huh
right yeah my husband has good benefits too or i probably wouldn't be able to do the temporary work
i think medical is probably one of the most important things
to have
wow
um-hum
yeah those must be pretty good benefits i've heard that usually they average about thirty percent of your salary so it sounds like maybe his company's a little bit better
right yeah
no fortunately we still have the it's just regular traveler's insurance that my husband has so we can go anywhere
i guess that's good i don't know i can't decide
oh yeah
uh-huh
really
won't let them stay any longer it frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then they're gone
yeah really
right yeah
yeah do you
does your husband's company have any of the new like a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits
right
yeah that's one thing i wish that we had was like a 401k plan or one of those things were they matched what you could save those are really good deals
yeah
that or retire i don't think we can plan on social security taking care of us so
yeah with what they say about how the population's changing i think attitudes'll have to change to go along with that
and that'll probably change the insurance benefits too as people get older and still work and
they'll need more health care
so
yeah
does that just supplement like medicare or
yeah
yeah that's good see i my husband been self-employed and he's worked for like a small companies and now he's in a little bit bigger company so we've seen a little bit of every kind of benefit you can have
right
yeah when we when he was self-employed and we had to get our own insurance
to get maternity benefits was just ridiculous i mean you might as well have saved the money you paid every month and paid your own hospital bill at the end of the year or something
right
well it was good talking to you
you too bye
well what's the best experience you can come up with as far as camping
oh man that sounds like a blast
is that right
yeah that's where you just float down the river right
on tubes an
i see
well that sounds pretty neat
i guess i guess for me
probably the last time i went camping was back in high school with boy scouts we always took an annual trip up to colorado and went fly fishing
and we had we had a blast up there
it was nice going up there and see that scenery
i see
right
i see
did they have some pretty good campsites up there
i see
i see that sounds pretty neat
right
yeah i remember going with my parents we weren't very good campers it seemed like we were never prepared and we
i grew up right around amarillo up in the very northern part of texas
and we had a couple of lakes out there that we'd go and go fishing and then camp out and seemed like it always rain or something you know something had to go wrong and we were never prepared for it
so it wasn't it wasn't until boy scouts that i really started enjoying going out and camping
it sure is in fact we went up there for easter and we had a beautiful day we had a day where it snowed and then it rained the next day and you know you just never can tell what the weather's going to do
right
oh lord
right
oh and there's nothing worse when you're out camping if you get wet
you know it
that's hilarious
i'm surprised you didn't just pack up and go home i
that's right that's right oh lord i guess everybody's got those experiences when things just didn't go right for them
right
oh lord
really
right
i see
do they have actual camp sites there where you can go and
i see
facilities or yeah
oh you do have to make reservations there
uh-huh
right
oh i see
huh i didn't realize that
since it's so popular it's best to have the
reservations huh
right
right memorial day and whatever
yeah
oh is that right
when's the best time to go down there for the water
takes that long to get it heat up
i see
huh because my wife and i had thought about going down there you know just for a weekend
because we have some friends from that went to school in san marcus at south texas
and they're always talking about how they rode the those inner tubes down the river and that sounded like a fun that'd be a fun weekend
hum
i see
huh
yeah
so you can actually rent cabins there
and that's in that's in new braunfels
huh
i see
yeah
god that sounds like a blast
well that sounds like that might be a fun place to visit then
we'll have to give that a shot
well i tell you what i guess i need to head out but i appreciate the conversation
you have a you have a good week
oh good deal good deal well you have a good one
all right bye-bye
okay
so
it just depends on what it is i mean i have my favorite things that i do and that's a fun thing to do sometimes but what about you
right
well see that's great yeah
well
right
well i think that well part i think that's partially true i think you have to have the will and the and the
anyway i think it you could be susceptible to stuff and it has to be reinforced at another level too but anyway what would you watch if you had you know this week to watch i mean do you like specials
oh
oh right yeah
well we have cable also and sometimes you can get the hbo specials and sometimes those are really
pretty hysterical so i like to watch comedy i mean you know that's something but i'm not real up to date on what's going on now i guess i have my old favorites that i
hooked into i mean you know like bob newhart still on one channel and you know something on that level i also enjoy i don't know its sunday morning
it's channel thirteen i watch a lot of thirteen the mclaughlin group and i just laugh i mean i think it's so hysterical these guys it's just so much fun it's just
oh now that was fabulous and that you know yeah
yeah
i know so
you know well there's certain i mean i've got my tv in the kitchen here and you know if there's something like cooking shows i love to watch cooking shows
i really do
you know things like that you get a whole lot of exposure
yeah
yeah
oh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah i good
isn't that amazing how old are your kids
oh okay so that's yeah
i had forgotten about that see it's just my husband and i and so i don't have that you know i that constant influence of the kids shows and all that but i don't know
yeah
and you know they get it at school too anyway so you might as well not reinforce it you know i
i know i remember going to my parents were a lot like that too and of course we did not have any of the variety you know kids have but all the kids used to watch rawhide and all those shows
and it always made me feel a little bit you know like a loner like i you know but
but see then my parents i think then you have to replace it with other things you know to
really yeah
that's true or you go rent a video up at the store and come home and sit down and watch it you know
somewhat
is that right
yeah where abouts in pennsylvania
where in pennsylvania
oh do you well great
i watch i try to watch the news and i read the newspaper and i like to read time magazine people magazine keep up what's going on in the world
but
well i just pretty a little you know about everything and not and then again not everything but you know i like to know
pretty well what's happening so political things don't interest me a great deal except i do like to stay informed enough to
feel like i halfway vote intelligently you know
but
and stay in touch with it know feel like i know what's going on now i have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events
but i always have been
and i stay up with it but how do you how do you stay aware of most of the current events newspaper
tv news or what
um-hum
uh-huh
well that's yeah that's good because
uh-huh well you stay up with it pretty well then
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh yes uh-huh
oh you've been there well you would be interested in it then
yeah i follow it you know i don't just read everything about but i i'm always aware of what's going on like that
and because it is it's interesting
and i don't know i feel sorry for those people down there they've just been so
terribly mistreated for so many years you know i mean through papa doc i mean he was a terrible tyrant
and it i think it's been better since he died but it's still been bad
but
even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew i i've read some things about him that he was he wasn't too good himself
yeah he was pretty much a he didn't mind having people bumped off for
but
and not that
i think it's pretty darned good i think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have
i really do now i they sometimes they jump on it and go a little to the extreme the media does but
but that's kind of understandable because you know of course if you watch it more than once a day i mean it's the same thing over and over and over and over and i listen to the radio watch
so i you hear it so much you get a little tired of it but then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe
but i think the quality of our news is just i don't believe it could be better
i really don't
i don't think so
i don't think our news could be better
i mean i mean what else could they do to make it better
i don't see anything that they could do
well you always wanna think everything can be improved upon i understand what you're saying
but by trial and error over the years i think they got it about as good as they gonna get it
nothing is perfect but
yeah
uh-huh
well that's true i understand what you're saying and then again
i understand why they can't dig too much deeper that's why we have cnn you know cnn has the time since that's all they do is news to dig deeper
well i'm in a i'm in an urban area i'm in dallas
and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem even a more major problem in dallas some of the major problems
drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with people trying to get money for drugs
and i think that's a national problem though it's not unique
yes
uh-huh
well now we're pretty close to the golden triangle aren't you
right research triangle and all of that and
i'm sure you have a lot of students there and a lot of researchers so you may have a
you know perhaps a little better economic climate but in all your cities now it seems like there's a crowd that's really effected by this bill
really
really
hm
well here i'm not sure how many dallas has had i've
houston is averaging about two a week or three or four i don't know a number every week
dallas is having quite a few it seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or like i say drug related
i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values seems like a lot of people
don't hold human life quite as high as
perhaps they used to
i
um-hum
boy that really that really takes someone who's bold to do that
well now do you find that security is very good in a in a town home
uh-huh
well that
i see
yeah
well i think you hit on one point there is you know each other i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything i am
oh about three blocks off a major road and a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs
i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the commercial districts and i'm over the northeast part of dallas and it's a in a nice neighborhood the houses here
before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now
but we have one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away
and now that the economy is bad they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the
they're not nearly as selective as they used to be
and course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so i'm sure that aggravates it also
but unemployment now in dallas or in texas is up around six point
well
did you get a chance to watch any of the games
yeah
no i don't think so because i saw just a little bit of the game today and he was out there playing
although i what i saw was at the end of the first quarter i think he only had like eightch eight points
at the end of the first quarter they thought that was big news
so i don't know but i don't know who won and i don't know who do you normally pull for the mavericks or
oh yeah
oh jeez yeah because that's just dollars right out of the franchise
oh man
now i i've always been pulling for the lakers for a long time
and not just not just because they always win but when they had akeem
anybody who was old as that playing that well
you know i just kind of had to go with them then i kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players
i was i always wondered that you know i will take a look at the individual score you know in the individual stance in the nba
and you know they have in the paper you know like fifteen different categories
and they'll have like a individuals they'll have the highest scorer the top rebounders assists foul shooting percentages and all that
and you go thown through and virtually every one of the categories there isn't a laker in the top ten usually hardly anybody in the top twenty except for like magic
and yet the lakers continue to win so you're right i think they do really play much better as a team than they do each one you know individually at their spot
but
yeah
i understand that i guess boston's really giving aren't they playing detroit
i think boston's playing detroit and i think they're really giving them a run for their money
did he get hurt again
yeah
yeah
i tell you what i guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah matter of fact i watched him on tv you know sink i don't know a jeez it was like thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range
unbelievable
oh i don't know you ever play much basketball
yeah
it really is for a non contact sport quote unquote
some of those guys got pretty funny looking eye wear
man
yeah several years ago when i was up in cleveland i was staying at the marriott and the cavaliers were playing somebody i think it was like utah or somebody like that and i was down by the pool
and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water now i wear contacts and i had my glasses on and i went down there and just jumped into the water where they were
and it went right up over my head and i came up spittering and sputtering for air and they were all the basketball players there to play the cavaliers they were all like six eight and
you know six ten and they were standing in water that was like six foot
you know and it was it was funny i tell you i saw i saw a guy i don't remember what his name was but he got on the elevator and he had his swimsuit on
and he was just skin and bones you know it looked like something out of africa
but he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one
so you're right those guys really you know the big ones i don't even know how much ewing weighs
but he's got to be way up there
god
that's a that's a lot that's a lot of a lot of guy coming down on you
jeez
i didn't even see who's supposed to have the best draft picks
yeah
oh yeah
i used to go down to reunion arena went down there a couple years on the day of the draft
and that was really pretty interesting they usually have you know a video highlights of the season
you know and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage both the good and the bad
i don't know i haven't i didn't go down there last year but it was only like a couple dollars to get in and it was really kind of interesting
but so who do you thinks going to win the play-offs
chicago and let's see
golden state and the lakers
and chicago
and philadelphia
think chicago's playing philadelphia and then the
shoot
i can't remember them all now
right
yeah
yeah
nba play-offs
philadelphia was favored by one point over chicago and the lakers one point over golden state
and detroit by
five over boston
jeez
think so
i tell you what those guys really hang tough
you know i i'd like to see them back up there again
they really they really gave some really good years of
of enjoyment and fun and everything have you ever been up there to boston garden
well i don't know is that in i haven't really gone to a lot of games live but boy i'd sure like to
basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun
do you have any elderly parents or grandparents that have ever had to go in a nursing home
oh
oh now was it how did you feel about that was it a good nursing home and you felt good about her being there or
a fair one
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
oh wow that is good
boy i'll say that is good
um-hum
my word so she couldn't take care of herself at all
did how did she feel about it did she how did your mother feel about it
didn't she
oh
oh
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
my word
oh boy now what about the expense part of it was it an expensive one or did her did she have health insurance or
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh
oh great
well that helps because i know that it can take a person's whole life savings i
my parents are not quite that old yet but my grandmother right now is in this situation where she cannot stay alone at home either and so
her she has four daughters and one son and the four daughters
rotate and keep her for three months at a time and they are all in a position where they can do that right now and then my husband's grandmother about oh probably two years ago she fell and broke her hip
and of course she had to go into the nursing home there and it was a fairly nice one in fact she got to where she enjoyed it there she knew the staff and knew the other people that were there and in fact when she came home
she was able to get better and come home she really missed the association with the people there
and i but i don't know i whenever i go into a nursing home i
for some reason it makes me feel sad i because i a lot of people i know are there just because
you know their families want them there and they don't
they aren't willing to take care of them and i think that's a sad situation
um-hum
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
oh no
my word that many of them
oh boy i it is i don't know a nursing home seems to be such a
a non personal environment the ones that i've been to i have been to one that seemed really you know warm and cozy but for the most part they've seemed you know no carpet on the floors and
right that's right yeah so
uh-huh
that's right
that's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah so it's got to be the most controversial thing if you could pick on the list
oh we don't have capital punishment i believe you do
oh
yeah the only thing about capital punishment is the i remember someone saying i think it was a chief justice in this state
he goes if you make a mistake how do you get the person back that's the whole his whole basis was if you do have that error
you know some people have been in jail for years and years and years and they're finally exonerated and then you know if there if you killed the person and it's like oops too bad
i mean i think i've heard of cases where someone did they the they were it was capital punishment they were killed
and they found out years later that the he really didn't kill the person
i believe there was one case i don't i don't know where i read it or anything but i think there has to they have to have put innocent men or women to death before i mean
i'm the type of person who sits you know it's the same thing about the war i'm this type person you know you need it
but you're the one who you can't you can't make the decision and go yes or no i'd be a terrible president because
i would you know i knew we had to go to war and i knew you know it was the best thing but i didn't i would not want to be responsible for people getting hurt if you know if i don't know
well like
yes but like you say there there's people out there that do such terrible things i had one of the subjects was crime
and it was talked about the way society has worked out there's some people that economically trapped
and they really their parents don't bring them up properly they have absolutely no morals because no one taught them
i mean morals isn't something that's just in your heart and
you're born with it you're
it's something that's taught it's something on the streets that you see so if it's a dog eat dog world
it it's just really too bad that we have to have something like capital punishment
but
i don't know how much of a deterrent it really is
you don't think it's a deterrent
so even though even though you don't think it's a deterrent which i have a tendency to -gree agree i mean it's a deterrent it's the ones like carefully thinking it out and stuff
they think about it but a lot of the street crime that goes on and stuff they don't really care and they don't really care what happens to them i can see where it's not a deterrent
yes
does it matter to you do you have a lot of violence where you live
where you work
so is dallas a bad city i talked to someone from san antonio and the barrio she said it was very bad
dallas
yeah
oh jeez
and that's relatively calm city
yes
and if anyone was bothering you could make such a fuss where people would come to your aid even though you're in the worst part of the city
the only difference is that every street light is lit instead of every other street light so we're a really we're pampered up here
and when they do have a crime a murder let's we had quite a few years ago a young two young men they were sixteen years old
raped and beat these two twelve year old girls really bad it just shocked the whole state
just how can anything happen like this and the guys that did it were so ignorant
they didn't even they didn't they didn't have any remorse for what they were doing but they were just so ignorant
that one of them says well i didn't realize that because i was beating her in the head that she was really going to die on me you know it's like
although why did you do it she was screaming all i wanted to do was shut her up he acted like he didn't even think that this was going to kill her i the kids were really quite ignorant about it and it
it was a tragedy on both sides but it just shocked the state that something like this could happen
i mean usually if something if someone robs in the night or something
and a home owner confronts him i mean it's not a blaze of guns and stuff you know the guy might hit the guy over the head and people start running
i mean if this happened in the city the i'm sure the youth would be armed and just take the family out
i mean we're really fortunate to live here but
doing these conversations it makes me feel really bad that there are kids that
can't get out of the situation they're in and they're they'll eventually end up even if they want to be good kids they'll eventually end up more or less victims of crimes even though they're doing the crimes they're more or less a victim
yes it's really sad
yes it's bad sometimes the kids have no choice because the parents are worse
i mean it they'll do drugs in front of their kids they bring this boyfriends and girlfriends home in front of kids they treat them like little slaves they holler at they hit them
oh jeez
that's stupid
we sit up here on our pedestals judging but we're not there but it's just it is totally unheard of that you even think it would happen
oh
yeah i know
oh
yeah
well then they wouldn't do this for the drug kingpin that they were going to institute the death penalty other or was it life in prison or whatever for the drug kingpins i don't
the drug war is just you can't trace it because a lot of the authorities are probably tied up into it i mean you know months ago it was the military
i pressed one all right on
benefits and for the benefits of working for a large corporation
i found the biggest i do work for one now and the biggest benefit is that there's a little more in backup when i need it
do you work outside of the home
oh
that's a pretty large corporation
um-hum
no yeah
yeah it keeps changing because they have to keep shopping around
um-hum
yeah do you like working for a large school system compared to a small one
um-hum
well i think course i'm a medical technologist and in our line of work it's awfully nice to not be out by yourself and that's the biggest benefit i find
because you have more backup and more people to call on with problems that may arise and
of course you know it varies with the situations
do you have good resources in your school district
yeah to my mind that's the best thing for working for a big place
is how about you how do you feel about that
um-hum
whole ball of wax
what would you like to change in your benefits
um-hum
yeah
do you have to pay
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well ours is
i know ours has improved over what it was because we just went to a larger corporation and that's what helped it improve but
the one thing i'd like to see in our profession is our retirement benefits are almost pathetic
so that's how i'd like to improve ours
oh well you have to
uh-huh you have to if you're smart
hum-um
um-hum
well in the large corporations the one the thing you have to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost at retirement age and
yeah and that's kind of rough
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah it happens
yeah but course i think they're losing an awful lot of valuable expertise
um-hum
i used to be in actual management and hiring and we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn off and rehire
because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work on it
yeah it was
it's expensive and i don't know why they don't build that into it but i guess
um-hum
oh did you already dial one
we're being recorded already
okay we're supposed to be discussing our homes
raised style
uh-huh my parents live huh
where did you got get there from
all right
i new you didn't have a texas accent
uh-huh
i hear you
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh i would imagine
so what kind of home do you live in
oh a colonial style two story
multistorey is what they call them
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh you work at ti
so that's how you got hooked up to this
you know you know you can converse with the person for a while and get to know them before you punch the one you don't have to get started on the conversation right away
well anyway well
oh i don't know several eleven twelve thirteen i guess
well i haven't made the calls mostly i've just i answered them i live in a two story type colonial here in maryland
yeah well most the homes here are two story because they stack them up since the property is so expensive at least in the maryland area where i am
yeah
yeah well like i say the land here and depending on where you are and how crowded it is the land bays go up and here a little old measly quarter of an acre goes from anywhere from four to five thousand to a hundred and some odd thousand depending on where it is
and if you're in a fairly decent subdivision which i guess maybe i'm in a fairly middle-class subdivision then
the general trend is to put as much house as you can on a quarter acre it took me a long time to get used to it coming from down south up here
big houses on little bitty postage stamp lots
but that's the general way they
they build them here so you get about a twenty two hundred to three thousand square foot home depending on whether you include the basement or not
on about a quarter of an acre or less about ten thousand square feet
uh-huh
huh
well they use slab foundations or do they use block foundations or the little
crawl space
okay slabs are easier and quicker to pour and lay i guess
uh-huh
i see what to dig out for it
do you have high water tables
so it's just a matter they just don't do it
uh-huh
well of course down there you probably don't have land as quite as much a premium so you can sprawl a big rancher out
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i understand well you say you live in a ranch style house yourself
well now
is it like a split level
in other words you've got some bedrooms above say a garage area and then the living room dining room area is halfway between both you go down steps to your garage and maybe a family room down there and you go up the steps to your bedroom
okay that's what they call a split level up here and a split foyer is where all the steps are at the entrance way
if you know what i mean
that's a split foyer type and then a colonial is where they stack it on top of each other and you pretty well have most of your living space on the first floor like
a family room or you know something like that and the dining room area and a living room and maybe a kitchen with a possible little eat in area or something like that
even gas water heater whereas my previous home it had electric water heater anyway and then the house i'm in now is all
electric it even has a heat pump
yeah and
well heat pumps do work pretty well up here it's taking them a few years to get the bugs out of them but
they finally seem to work quite well and i would imagine down where you all live heat pumps will work quite well or maybe down there all you need is just air-conditioning that's all
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i would imagine all you need is just air-conditioning
uh-huh
oh that's right you're in the oil state so i would imagine there's plenty of gas around so that's the way to go for heat
yeah
uh-huh i would too because me i like gas heat i love it
oh really
uh-huh gas logs
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i don't mind electric heating and the like it's okay i mean i like gas heat because it's so nice and warm but when it comes to cooking i just absolute think a gas stove's the best that money can buy
you just can't beat cooking on gas
that flame man is hard to beat because you can regulate it and i mean you want to turn the flame down on the stove you turn it down right now you don't have to wait for a cool down time which you have to rely on with conventional stove or a warm-up time i mean it's instantly there
and that kind of response is quite effective i think for cooking
uh-huh
yeah
well i've done without it too but i sure prefer it my wife does too
yeah
uh-huh
well do your houses down there have porches or are they just pretty much like just a front door and that's it
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah aren't they nice
they're sort of coming back up here in the east
front porches are they're not very big but they're kind of coming back
uh-huh
uh-huh but i really love a screened in porch outback man i just eat that up
huh
well don't you all have mosquitoes down there
really
that's surprising
hm
how far are you guys from the coast down there where
what is it
oh are you that's a pretty good piece then
i didn't know you were that far inland i knew it was a ways but
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well tell me do your homes down there pretty much have garage disposals and things like that
they do are y'all on septic or y'all have public sewage
uh-huh
oh they use one and two car garages or just one car garages or carports
okay so they do go garage because i lived down south for a long time carports were real popular in certain areas where i
used to live
uh-huh
about how much floor space
yeah that sounds about average i think all over the country
yeah huh
oh really i don't either i hate to clean the rascals i had a i had a pool outback behind my previous house one of those
i got both
yep
it's half border collie and half lab
half border collie
yeah
yep it's
it's and you'd think he's an little poodle
he's about eighty pounds though
yeah
yeah
yep
yeah oh yeah they get along real good oh the dog was brought up with cats so he doesn't really bother the cats
well now the little kitten picks on him all the time
let's see about seven eight years old
and
and our cat's only about two years old
well we we've had cats and dogs before you know before we even got married so
so we've had them oh at one time we had two dogs and two cats
but
oh yeah well ours does that the company when we get it
yep
oh yeah he he's pretty he's real friendly
but when somebody knocks at the door he's his barks
is real you know like he's a real bad dog
but
when you come in the house and he
he'd probably show the burglars where everything was at
oh
yeah
i've heard that too
um-hum
yeah i think it helps them too when they take them out for walks and stuff especially dogs you know plus they're the dog's a good
good way to protect your house too when you're gone
you know like i said he barks a lot when somebody knocks on the door or rings the doorbell so it kind of keeps people away
but our little our little kitty he she uses
she's pretty cute little the wife got her when
she was a stray and it bit her and so she had to bring it home with her to see if she got rabies or anything
yep so
well that's basically how she got the dog too
well not really
we the dog's name is morgan
and the cat's name is oscar anne
yeah well see at first they thought that the cat was a boy
so they called her oscar until the found out she was a girl so they just called her oscar anne
so that's
that's the name there and how we got the dogs was we were stationed in england and
she went to some we had a dog and she took it to dog obedience school
and this farmer was gonna kill these six puppies they had and
she kind of said well i'll kind of i'll take one of them off your hands
and that's how we got morgan
i think well i didn't really come up with the name she did so
uh-huh
okay
well i basically listen to all kinds of music
even you know from easy listening you know i just find that so relaxing you know i like fall asleep to that
i listen to
and i just you know i just can't grasp that you know i just don't understand why he likes that
i listen to the lyrics and i don't know
yeah and you and you right you listen to the lyrics and un and he even went to their concert and i'm like i don't know this person he
no they yeah they made them they made them wait forever and yeah
um-hum
he's not wild or anything but i just i don't know
oh well you're a you're a pretty cool mom then my mom would've never gone for that
um-hum
my mom would've probably ripped the radio off the
out of the stereo if i'd have turned that on
um-hum
okay
what is that the summer musicals i've heard of it but i don't i'm not
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
what
what
what year was all that popular
is it was it in the sixties that it was that it that what did you say hammerstein
uh-huh
fifties
um-hum
so it was just concerts or did they did they like oh they acted out the scene and oh
um-hum
um-hum
do you listen to country
really i'm a i'm a clint black fan
i don't
she's okay
um-hum
have you gone to garth's concert
i heard his concert was
did they did they tell you that he swung from a rope like tarzan like tarzan he swung through the audience like
on a yeah i think that's true
yeah
oh what else i like cher she's an old you know she's kind of old singer she's been around a while
okay so have you seen any good movies lately
oh i haven't seen that one yet
no i haven't seen that one yet either
how about awakenings
okay well have you seen la story
yeah i have
well it was it was entertaining it was funny steve martin did a pretty good job
it's they portray the la lifestyle
and it's quite a lot crazier in the movie than it is in actuality i've been to los angeles before
it's kind of fun if you've been there before you'll be able to relate to the humor that they have in the movie
okay
i thought it was interesting how they cast that movie with victoria tennant as his love interest in the movie because she is his wife in reality
so that added something to the movie
no i haven't seen that one yet either
okay
yeah i heard that it was a little pretentious that the family was very wealthy
it just didn't appeal to as many people as it as it could have
yeah i've heard that's really good friend of mine at work saw that
well i understand it has a real complicated plot
uh-huh
okay yeah
you seen ghost
yeah it's been out for quite a while already
that is a is it is a very good movie
patrick swayze and demi moore did a really good job very emotional put it that way
well that's interesting the special effects were great i have to admit that
okay
you seen edward scissorhands
oh
it's
yeah it's somewhat of a bittersweet comedy
it stars johnny depp
he's from 21 jump street
and he portrays edward scissorhands this creation of vincent price kind of a scientist
who creates a person out of
it it's kind of interesting he doesn't complete the job though and his hands are not finished so he has scissors on the ends of his arms
and is found in this castle by
oh it's the local avon lady or something like that
and she takes him into her house and he learns
what life is like in a moderately normal suburb
it's it is entertaining it's kind of like a fairy tale
with a sad ending but
it's
it was different
a fun movie
oh yes certainly um-hum
oh i think it'd be great for a for a child
it does have a fairy tale like quality
that
scenery is very entertaining and what he does with the with the scissors and
doing certain types of landscaping working with shrubberies
he carves out different figures in the in the plants shrubs
yeah i they evidently spent a lot of time on the scenery for that the special effects
have you seen the field over at the inwood
that's i thought that was an outstanding film
with
with richard harris
he plays a kind of a patriarch in ireland nineteen twenties ireland
and it's about a piece of land that he rents
he works a piece of land and rents it from an old english widow
but he
he has an obsession with this piece of land that he wants to own it and won't allow anyone else to control that land
and when the widow puts it up for sale
he claims that it's his even though he cannot afford the price
it goes to an american who has ancestors from the area
he's trying to
apparently trying to
gain some background on his heritage from ireland so he's buying this piece of land to try to introduce civilization to the area
and there are just a lot of interesting
well they well they have more of the artsy type of films a lot of foreign films there
no not too often but this was a just a good opportunity to go see that movie it was
i really enjoyed it
yeah
oh okay
well getting back to that other film with which one was that with jodie foster
silence of the lambs yeah i didn't really care for her earlier films taxi driver or the accused and i was kind of wondering if this was a little different style
departure from what she's done before
okay
see i never did care for her too much in the other films so
friend of mine at work says that this one is a lot different that she's really good
all right that's interesting because i
okay
well that's good i'll have to go see that
it's been highly recommended
anthony hopkins
uh-huh
sounds like i'll have to go see that one soon
okay yeah sleeping with the enemy with julia roberts i haven't seen pretty woman yet have you seen that one
because she was just on the people's choice awards the other night
and won a people's choice award for best female entertainer
as well as an award for this movie
okay well i'll have to go see that one too
sounds like another obsession type movie like fatal attraction
i thought that the movie the movie that it was based on was better
that was which one was that
with clint eastwood and donna mills
it came out in nineteen seventy trying
oh it was called play misty for me
and i thought that was a very good film and fatal attraction was on the same theme almost identical
but i didn't care for fatal attraction as much
yeah
right
well
okay well i think we're reaching our limit anyways so
all right i appreciate it thanks a lot bye
no actually i'm a spectator and i'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's or my late husband's interest in golf
um-hum
and he was really enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments he could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held and what the nature of the hole was and
oh yeah he was a good golfer
and as and did some you know instructions at the country club for a while
but golf tended to be i am not really deeply involved in any following any of the sports
but golf was one that i developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers and therefore i enjoyed following those particular players
uh-huh
and i know that my husband tom kite was his fair haired boy and he thought he was spectacular i said whoa i'm not going to i'm not going to stay interested in him so
i decided andy bean was good competition any time they both played why he was just real excited when tom was you know shown on the television and
i followed andy bean
we both followed lee trevino into the seniors
he is he is a character not just a golfer but he's quite a character
and there are some really
wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models
and i think it's critical it's critical to have a good role model
in any field any sports
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i myself really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf you hit a little ball you chase it you go find it and then you hit it again and lose it again
and i know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier
oh i know oh yeah
um-hum
oh yeah well my husband's average ran in the mid seventies so he wasn't bad
he was pretty good but as far as influencing young people i think that is that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age you can't play football at fifty five
but it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle anything can be warped
but i think that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to move into maturity safely um-hum
that's right that's right and a lot of seniors a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're you know in their later years
that's right that's absolutely right and it's something that
or you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles
you know you can go to the country club together you can play with your friends he can play with his friends but you've both been out and exercised and you have enjoyed the day
you bet you get a lot of exercise that way
um-hum well i'll tell you what if
if they're not real good golfers sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long
um-hum
oh mine had a very short fuse if he did something bad he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it he's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls i mean just get so mad he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
well the one thing that is a is a drawback about it i think is the cost
membership in the clubs is expensive the equipment is very expensive requires special shoes requires special you know special equipment there's so many
that's right
that's right that's right it can get very expensive and i can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing
and they don't give those sessions away and nor do they give instructions away
as a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if i thought i'd be interested in golf i said i don't know i'll have to try it and see i've always watched it and he said well fine he said we'll just take you over to the course he lives near brookhaven
we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it if you do then we can go golf together
i said oh whoa great i get to walk all around a little green field all day
but those kinds of things happen though you get a little taste of it and you say hey this is not bad
and you really begin to develop an interest in it but i am not an athlete at all you know i'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball and
and hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball so i am not an athlete maybe golf is a forgiving sport i don't know
um-hum i really i haven't really acquired an interest in it but i'm open to try anything you know
the one thing that is also detrimental as far i'm concerned my skin is very fair so i'm going to have to golf in the evening or i'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me and i don't
do you yeah
well you know the best recipes that i have come from southern living
do you get that magazine
oh it's wonderful you know i've never had a recipe fail that i've gotten out of southern living and i've had dinner guests come over for dinner and
yeah
i well that's what i do too and it has a it's been wonderful right
uh-huh
yeah where you from originally
oklahoma
uh-huh so you've had you know tex-mex and that kind of thing i
yeah well i had never had chili in my whole life until i moved down to texas and i had connecticut and i had never even tasted chili and i moved down here and
that is funny that is funny
oh really
no i don't think i would i would care for that but you know what i recently discovered there's something at the grocery store it's called cajun magic
like red beans and rice with all the spices already in it and all you have to do is add water and cook it and it is so good
and that's wonderful
and i laughed
what a neat idea
oh how nice
do you like desserts
oh
is it wonderful
oh
oh i would love that i like
i'm not crazy about sweets but i really have a passion for cakes any kind of cake i really like chocolate cake and apple cake
love apple cake oh i love apple cake or spice cake something like that yeah i really like that
um-hum yeah it is yeah it is
oh
oh
oh was your was your cholesterol that high
hum
really
really wow
is two forty really that high though
yeah
you know what i just recently got a cookbook it's the oh what's the name of it
love your heart
cookbook it's a low cholesterol
cookbook and then i got the american heart association cookbook now this is not southern living
yeah lots of yogurt and stuff like that but if you go to like the bookstop do you have one of those in carrollton
they have lots and lots of cookbooks with low cholesterol recipes
yeah give me some more refried beans have you have you tried
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah have you tried the no fat no cholesterol dressings like the kraft
the italian is the italian is not bad
oh
yeah and does it take have you tried that is it terrible
heartwise or heart yeah
okay
it's supposed to be on the instruction sheet but
i didn't see one on mine
hm
yeah
okay
zero three two okay
okay
oh okay that'll work okay let me hit one now
okay in my community they are doing a lot as far as recycling goes waco's a pretty small city and so a lot of the city people
i guess they want they take they take care of the community more than i would think that a big city does
or they can because they're smaller and so they're doing all kinds of recycling projects and the school kids are doing all kinds of things and i'm a i'm a news reporter and so i
report on a lot of the recycling things that they do and just last week they opened up a new recycling center so now they have two in an adjoining community hewett
they are doing curbside recycling which is something a lot of cities are starting to look into but for some cities it's very expensive
so
uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah that's a form of the curbside yeah
um-hum
i know even wal-mart department store i don't if they do it there they have the recycling bin right outside the store
and it's got glass aluminum plastic and
uh-huh
right the plastic
um-hum
uh-huh yeah
wow
do you recycle yourself at home do you
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
hm
it's kind of rough doing the newspaper i understand because the they can't recycle the i guess it's the sale papers that have the color on them
and so it's kind of hard for them to i guess separate all that
um-hum yeah i don't think anybody would you know i don't think they can put the colored paper on there or something so that should be pretty difficult
yeah especially on my job i'm hardly ever home so you know my
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum yeah
you just go in and you don't know when you're coming out
so but let's see what else are they doing
jeez i'm all out of recycling
um-hum
uh-huh
hm
right my mother before all this recycling stuff started i guess well not before it all started but she would collect the cans and you go like in front of the supermarkets or whatever and you put the cans in this
bin thing and it spits out money yeah that's
yeah that freaked me out when we first did that i thought okay
so at work we do we have a little recycling bin for our cans and bottles and those go out
uh-huh
hm
uh-huh
um-hum
wow
wow
right
uh-huh
just regular paper and
hm
um-hum
um-hum
oh
so that gives you kind of an incentive
well that's great if you know that like a lot of things you pick up today almost everything says
recyclable or this is made from recyclables or something it's amazing it really is it's amazing to me how fast i i'm sure recycling's been going on forever and it's just
i guess everyone is picking it up now you know but it's just amazing to me how much it's come in the last year since last earth day you know everything's i mean recycle everywhere you go
um-hum
um-hum
hm
i remember my mother used to take the coke bottles in and you get like ten cents or something like that
yeah i guess that was a form of but now it's just like perpetrated into the into the you know society it's like if you don't recycle you feel you feel almost
i don't know like you're doing something wrong or you feel guilty almost so hm
yeah wasteful um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
throw it away that's it
yeah we're spoiled very spoiled
right i know i'm doing the big story i'm covering now is of about our landfill here
and what was it i think twenty four million tons of garbage that we throw away
america could be recycled
like twenty four million to and i think that accounts for i think one quarter or half of the landfill space
so i mean i just learn all these little
propaganda things
oh yeah
yeah
not at all
hm
um-hum
hm
yeah that's like the big stink around here this landfill thing they're wanting to expand it and a lot of the people that live around the area don't want it expanded because you know they say it'll
poison their water and you know poison the air and there's an elementary school right across the street and all kinds of stuff so it's a pretty big issue
um-hum
exactly
um-hum
um-hum
right that's what a lot of people are saying that it may not hurt now but they're looking in the long run you know and they're saying well forty years from now we'll
yeah
um-hum
hm
yeah which crimes do you feel that
yeah because so many times that's so brutal and just recurrent
felons i think should also
yeah
uh-huh
yeah that's a
go ahead texas is too texas i saw on tv the other night is the has had forty six in like the past several years
so they're pretty
hip on it too i guess they do it by lethal injection at huntsville
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's what's happening here there is like that's in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the turn over rates of
repeat offenders being let out and doing it again
um-hum
yeah
i wish if they were gonna do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't be a little more you know not being able to put it off for fifteen years
oh really
goodness
um-hum
yeah
yeah
i yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little too lenient kind of takes away
from the significance of the death penalty
i'm a graduate student at the university of texas in dallas
audiology
yeah what do you do
oh really
oh really neat
yeah
in california so i think it the forty sixth in last twenty five years i think it's what they gave a run down that texas
texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then
yeah they don't get repealed as easily as they do
like the guy in california got you know twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said okay no you don't have to go and then they took him back i mean it just seems
yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent and then you had like who you have
these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back whenever you know
no i don't think the military doesn't execute anymore so
or death before the firing squad or whatever
so i think about the only one is
rape
okay let's see i guess
i can start i'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing yeah
so i'm looking at something larger than what we have we've got like an eighty four charger that's about gone and a an eighty nine horizon
so i'm looking for something a little bigger yeah
so we were thinking minivan for a while and we're looking at some just some four door five passenger sedans as well
i don't really have a preference either way i guess you know it's
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
oh like a miata or something like that
yeah
that's interesting yeah i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because i look for you know size and safety and then mileage probably
uh-huh
yeah i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that
and then a little bit at life expectancy i guess but it you know depends on what you
what you pay initially but you know i've got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the charger actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
and she got just a commute between cincinnati and dayton
it's you know we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but
the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it so
but
um-hum
yeah
that's interesting
but yeah it it's hard to beat some of the
like i guess we're in particular we're looking at a like a ninety one corsica that's buy back at a they say gm sponsored auction but i think they're obliged to have these things because
hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to gm
after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you
yeah
because i guess i mean well ninety two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for
on the lot so all the depreciation has been taken off and
guess the dealer comes out okay you know i don't know what kind of i don't know what gm corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off of it
so but i don't know we keep looking at that minivan it's just you know we can get a like a caravan for right twelve five but that's a little more than we want to spend right now
but
it's interesting but
i don't know if it seems to be
the public school system seems to be
getting a lot of criticism lately i guess over the years it's always seemed worse to the parents that have kids in there than it was when they were there so
i don't know how much of it is well a lot of it is deserved but then a lot of it's not i mean the kids are coming out learning
things a lot faster whether or not they actually have it learned that yet remains to be seen at least in our kids case it's they're still in it but i know they're learning things that
we never learned plus they have the burden of
well this is the burden they have the task of learning computers even in kindergarten they had a requirements that they had to meet for learning the
terms like keyboard and monitor and they wanted know what a computer was and what a disk was and
you know all the yeah it is but it's interesting that there's that much more knowledge to be learned at this at this age you know not just the colors and begin on the alphabet it's
learn your colors learn your alphabet learn all your little terms here and learn how to
begin learning some of the reading and by the second or third grade the little school system that we're in
they have really a lot of computers it's a very
wealthy district as all that fighting's going on over who gets the money and the like but they have
they have twenty seven computers for each of the little labs and each lab serves
two grades so the first and second graders have their own batch of computers that they've cycled the kids through and
and so there's well i guess three or four different labs and they're all very nice computers all tied together on the lan and one server that handles all the
software so that the teachers don't have to go around to each machine and do their work they can control it from the server it's a beautiful system but
the only bad thing it seems to do is not the computer necessarily but the school system seems to put a little bit more
pressure on the kids than we had of course of course i guess with that learning comes that pressure
we also managed to land in a school that
they decided to build one big rectangular building and then not have any walls for the classroom and so it gets a little noisy it's a little hard to keep the kids that quiet from one class to the next and they can't really
be rowdy at any one given time so they put them outside a lot they try you know to get a lot of good breaks here and there and
but they just took bookcases and things to move around and sort of what you know sort of build a an idea of a wall
and the kids seem to handle it okay but it's got some drawbacks to it
and as if that wasn't bad enough they also experimented with a particular size school most of the elementary schools were seven hundred
kids in it only goes from kindergarten up to fifth grade for our elementaries and our particular schools run thousand fifty right now
so they put a few more warm bodies in there than the teachers really needed to have they still have a twenty three to twenty five or so to one teacher ratio but it's still
up against a creek and there's no street access to it except for one turn around driveway and that feeds onto a street that is right across the street from
go over there to pick up my son about two thirty
and he gets out at two forty five and that gives me a little bit of time to get parked and then i wait for between kids rather than drive all the way home i wait a little while and at two thirty i mean at three thirty my daughter gets out
and we usually let them play if the weather's nice play outside until the traffic dies down and then we go home so i'm there from two thirty until four o'clock i'm just waiting for
to pick up the kids that's how much of a chunk it takes out of the old day but it is better just to let them you know play outside than it is to fight the traffic so
and there's it's real nice park lands on both sides of the school they have you know climbers and stuff like that but
the school system in and of itself as far as what they're teaching
they cannot keep up with the private as far as because of the ratio there's just no way plus the private tends to have
the more disciplined kids you know they're not dealing with the whole gamut of personalities here they're private schools do not put up with
a child that is that much of a problem like most schools have to
so you have that kind of a situation but by the same token you have kids coming out of private schools that they've spent very much time with them
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well another thing that we've noticed that's changed over the years and
we're not really sure exactly what we're going what we want to do with it publicly but
the teachings
the ideas that are taught don't always agree with what we would teach them either from a standpoint of morals or from a standpoint of how to handle a given situation
and there seems to be a large degree of violence not necessarily taught but ingrained in a majority of the kids either from tv or from
quite a few kids like in the
second to third grade take karate lessons and take various self-defense things and it's given to them or it's proposed
it seems to be socially acceptable as a self-esteem you know building the person's confidence up and you have
third and fourth graders that are you know when they get into a fight they tend to use some of the
maneuvers that they have and they feel a little more confident about their fighting ability they tend to get into a few more fights and several of them have ended with police calls and having broken bones down at that level of
of kids i know more than one kid that has got a record already just because of fighting of that nature
and then you get into the whole area of well what i would deem the new age thinking where they have these little extra classes but they offer to come in about fifteen to twenty minutes early in the mornings and
all the kids will sit around in a little circle and they're asked to empty their minds and to think about they have a name of a particular dinosaur that they they're to think about that dinosaur and they're encouraged
that's right you better you better enjoy doing it or else it's not really worth it
the last one i did myself was i was i found that i was backing out of the garage and i got a little too close to the door on the driver's side i was watching too closely on the passenger side i guess
and i wasn't paying attention closely enough and i ended up
whacking my side view mirror off the side of my car which kind of made me kick myself but
but i looked into getting that replaced and that was going to cost a fair amount of money because i would have to take it to the dealer
who would put a factory replacement part on and then charge me fifty bucks and hour to do the work
and so i figured well i can do that myself i i'll pick up the mirror myself which alone was more money than i wanted to spend on a just a little mirror but it was it it's one of those power ones and it's heated and
and all that
and i was going on a trip the next day so i figured i'd go out that night and put the mirror on but i ended up i had to take the whole door apart to
yeah to get the cable where the cable plugged in to the to the rest of the system was way down in the door
yeah it was more than i really wanted to do and then i got it i finally got it all apart figured out what i had to do and i put the mirror on and i got it plugged in and i put the door back together
and everything was fine i also have power windows and i had to have the window down to do what i was doing
oh no i'm sorry i had to have the window up to do what i was doing and i went to
no it was down it was down i had to have the window down i went to put the window back up it was the middle of winter and the window wouldn't go up because i had the cable yeah
and no i took the door all apart again and i moved the cable over so it wasn't blocking the window but i don't know it used to be fun doing those sorts of things and i maybe i'm loosing interest or
also cars are getting a lot more complex than they used to be
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
oh
oh okay yeah
uh-huh
oh boy
yeah
that's one way to do it
now i think my mechanic found a way to do that there's a switch somewhere that you can push that pop the light up without turning it on
i don't know where that is on my car because i have the flip up type too
but he did something to make that happen
yeah
yeah um-hum
yep
that's right
yep
right
yep that's right or unless it's high enough off the ground that you can crawl underneath it
but that's not usually easy either
um-hum
um-hum
so what do you do in your lawn do you do it yourself or do you hire someone to do it
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah right
uh-huh
saturday and sunday four days a week
so
it was this last summer yeah
now if it we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know
but yeah we do our you know mowing ourselves and everything and i
do our planting of bulbs and things for i can have some spring flowers
and
um-hum
um-hum
oh
um-hum
yeah
yeah we have quite a few roses i just we in fact we just pruned them way down and i just had to replace on of them so i just bought that yesterday and probably go outside today and plant that
but i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long
i even had roses on my table for christmas dinner
and those are always pretty but they get so tall and they bend over so fast
you know
um-hum
hum
um-hum well is it that one of those amaryllis
no huh
oh okay
uh-huh
do you have a big yard
um-hum
um-hum
yeah right
um-hum
um-hum well that makes it nice
well it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool but we don't have one
you know but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just we just have
so we do have a garden you know
it's amazing what you can get out of a little
you know it's probably about twenty by
i don't know
twenty by six something like that and it's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there
but it was nice a few cucumbers
um-hum
well the cowboys are my favorite team that's pretty easy to say nowadays lot easier than it was a couple years ago
but they had a big win today did you get to watch it
oh are you a cowboy fan
right yeah
uh-huh
right
yet
right
right
yeah they made it to the play-offs finally like just you know two years ago they were one and fifteen they won like just one game
and so it's a pretty fast turn around but this year they made it to play-offs and today was their first game and they beat the chicago bears
so everybody's really going crazy you know down here
so they turned it around but yeah they have a lot of young exciting players now up
i mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired tom landry but you know now it's like you know they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that
uh-huh
right
right
exactly you know
um-hum
you know they have a young team it's you know a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old you know players every year and
you know same coach same everything so now it's you know like a taste of something different they're all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be now it's like you know
tough and dirty team so everybody is really excited and
you know so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the super bowl but you know
it's just that we have to play every game away you know it's gonna be tough but
but their competition are teams that they've already beat this year so i mean atlanta they're in it too and we beat them
and see detroit we play them next week but you know we should beat them everybody feels like we should be able to beat them so
um-hum
right
right
right
yeah well the cowboys are on a roll they've won like i think six or seven in a row now so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the play-offs
so
right yeah troy aikman he got hurt at ou so he transferred to ucla
right
um-hum they're playing tonight in fact i'm watching them on tv right now
but they're doing some stomping on virginia
really well they're doing good tonight
yeah they're winning they're winning forty one to seven
yeah right but
yeah ucla yeah
but
the cowboys did good today i mean i was proud i thought i thought they would get beat today because
i mean they're so young you know play-offs
i don't know if you feel the same but when it comes to telling kids that they have to do two or three years of service into some kind of community i don't know if that's
appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen or you know in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do
and
i as far as a high school course i could see it as maybe a social sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program
and to me that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year but to tell them that they had to do two years there after post high school of community service i'm
i'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do
um-hum
exactly
right
um-hum
exactly
and doing it for a purpose that they want the other thing is this i have thought about this and many times when you get these young troubled teenagers that don't have like the perspective of
of the community a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems but there are other people out in the community that may have problems
then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing you have to do so much as far as in a community service now if they were you know the abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse
or if they destroyed some property around the area then they would have to do to restore it and perhaps
work for the community to beautify it or whatever but
i could see that working in you know cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law
and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever and that's i think they have done that and
judges have said well you know this is what you're gonna get for you know a misdemeanor or something you may end up having to do some kind of community service so i could see that as
something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled
um-hum
um-hum
sure we sure do
um-hum yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
exactly yeah
um-hum
and there's a lot of anger sure you know especially if they haven't went through treatment and they dealt with other people in the system of prisons which
you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever i would say the crimes would probably be you know if you went in for a certain crime there might be somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have so you're dealing with people
that may be an influence later on and an issue of anger would be is that i went to prison for a year or two but i didn't get any rehabilitation or
you know but then again those that have physically assaulted somebody
that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in the community if they're of a violent sort and to say well you have to
okay how do you keep up with current events
yeah what channel do you watch or what station
that's the one i watch i usually keep up with tv
i don't i am a student so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't
too great sometimes
yeah the radio doesn't really have much
news sometimes the stations i listen to are just mainly music
yeah do you think that tv is pretty accurate i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or
yeah
yeah it's they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news
huh
yeah
going they're looks like they're going more for ratings than for
you know actual news
i think you know the
probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
they
typically have a better i am from a small town too here in texas
and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato and
yeah farm report and oil reports
that's pretty sad or who killed who
yeah
well in dallas i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into luby's
and the story was
yeah and the news covered it
right you know hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying who
local news station was using as a as their promo
to promote themselves i just thought that was really
that's kind of cold
yeah and it was just they were showing like these dead people and they were showing people crying i mean just taking advantage of you know
it real personal moment
yeah it didn't seem like there was like much coverage of the story but just the play on people's emotions
it's just gotten so i mean
somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in walter cronkite days you know
yeah
yeah
yeah what did you think of the coverage of the war
did you
yeah
the damage that really happened that's
if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know
got really hurt and everything and
hello my name is donna and i'm calling from plano texas
oh okay would you like me to go first
okay i have three children two who are in regular school eleven year old an eight year old and then my little one
three year old is in a university of gymnastics it's a preschool and i think it was really hard to pick the right
day care or preschool or mother's day out i guess you can classify them all together
some of the qualifications that i look for was that you know the cost and exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic
in there and you know you know what the qualifications the teachers' were and if the place was clean and the hours and
just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff
oh well congratulations
right
or staying home
um-hum
um-hum
that's a very good place to start i think um-hum yeah the mother's day out programs and that's where shannon had started in a mother's day out program and the churches always have i think a pretty good program and
you have to make sure that you that you apply pretty early because they do have a lot of places have very long waiting lists and another question to ask is if they're state certified
you know if the teachers have their master's degree in child education and child development you know what kind of a structure is it going to be
when your child's a little bit older like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap is there like a mandatory nap time
what they do at shannon's school is have a video tape going and if and they lay on these little mats and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep and a teacher stays with the sleeping ones and the other ones get up and go do something else so
she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there you know which is which is nice
that's true
right and sometimes when the child's a lot younger before they're really before three years old
you know like the church is a good program and sometimes you even consider you know having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or something like that
and another consideration is how many infants or children are they what's the ratio of teachers to children because that makes a
a difference and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day just your child and or do they just put any child in any crib and you know you'd want maybe
your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know but i'm sure that
i bet that's wonderful
um-hum
asking right
some places start them as early as i think well some places take them as infants i guess you know like eight weeks even
there's a place to look into
a friend of mine who's a nurse is was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in on fifteenth street up it's in plano somewhere where
nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants
infants and then only up to like two years old and it's supposed to be really a
you know some places just specialize in just real little ones and then other ones are the older children
but it is a difficult situation i think and they're when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry
all right
that's a good question
i had a job i had to go get a blood test for
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about
well i come from kind of a biased opinion because i'm a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor
and i've done employee assistant work and
i know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job
that are specifically drug and alcohol related and it's like in the billions of dollars every year
and the only way that they can prevent that is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free
and you know the problem in the work place is that people are
like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever i mean you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and nobody knows about it but you know ends up costing the company lots and lots of money
so
you know there
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
true
uh-huh
yeah
yeah well and it's i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job
if somebody's got a problem on the job
and if even if like you say even if it's just the secretary if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers then it it's still a problem
so
well yeah i guess it comes with the turf
yeah and then you're
in terms of
drugs they're illegal so you're
you're breaking the law anyway
probably the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of assessing for alcohol
and that's probably the biggest problem there is
yeah
uh-huh
well i guess that's one of the positive things that has come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something
they will give you an opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job
and i
yeah and i think the company benefits in the long run
what kind of testing do they do when you went
urine screen yeah
uh-huh
well that happens
to help them out
yeah
yeah
yeah it depends really on how strong a test it is they've got different degrees as far as how far back they can check
they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests they've got some companies that are doing hair tests
yeah well that they'll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test
back a certain period of time
because some of the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know it's kind of
hair follicles i guess are just dead protein and they
and it it's apparently almost like a calendar they they've got it
pretty precise now that they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and that type of thing
so
yeah
so i guess if they perfect that and then it's not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that
uh-huh
well i did too
uh-huh bye
oh wow
so you didn't get anything even all the all the warranties were out
you're kidding yeah we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too
yeah
that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product
it ends up being toxic and all these warnings so
i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than i just ended up using it
but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong
that's
and they all went out at the same time
or two days
wow
wow that's frustrating
uh-huh
uh-huh they go out a lot
yeah see i'm in the manufacturing field i -ust home from work and make automotive air bags the safety air bags
yeah
at morton international and
i well it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment we test everything
after each assembly process
and so our testing is pretty thorough but
the tests that well we test every one electrically we don't
i think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bag
and but we do test after during the assembly product after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there
after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process so
yeah
well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government
it's incredible how much testing they have to do
uh-huh
probably the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used
at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a service charge on
right we used to have american express and
visa that of course there's a yearly fee on
and we got rid of those we now have discover we have a visa that does not have a yearly fee and then
we have a card that our bank put out on a promotion this year that of the first year there is no yearly fee and of course we don't plan on keeping it the second year
because i'm pretty frugal about things like that
uh-huh
we find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and we travel quite a bit and we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or
whatever which we do pretty often and fact in a lot of motels we noticed from our most recent trip they that you do not even get the telephone turned on in your room unless you've left a credit card at the desk
so i suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some kind but
oh my
uh-huh
can you do that on a credit card
oh for heaven sakes
for the drugs yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
i have a girlfriend who has one that her husband doesn't know she has now she must rent a p post office box or something or i mean she couldn't beat him to the mail every month i wouldn't think
because they both work and they he's a fireman so he's home two days a week that she teaches and would not be there so i don't know how she manages it but she keeps that a secret and i would not want to pay her monthly
interest rate on the thing it just has to be awful because it
oh i would think so they've been married almost thirty five years so i think they've done things like that to each other for a long time
uh-huh
yes
well many years ago i bought wallpaper we have a large kitchen
which meant i was taking about eight dollars a month off
the balance the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it off and at that point i promised myself i would never pay interest on a credit card again so that's kind of been my motto
uh-huh
well as you say when you're taking children to the doctor and adults too it does make a difference our children are matured out of the home and our needs are much different than they were
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
i think those are the same people who have their credit cards charged up to the max and that's just a way of life i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
for one twelve dollar check it's never quite made sense to me but then
when my husband was in business he had one customer who said that he had to use credit cards because he spent more than he made every month and he was perfectly serious about it
uh-huh
we it's very difficult to find their stations so i guess that's one reason why we use we've used discover and visa quite a bit for fuel even
uh-huh
i thought that was illegal
no to put a surcharge on a credit card
of
oh so what they're doing they're discounting for cash is the way they're because i think it is illegal to add a surcharge so
that's that they're looking at it differently it amounts to that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but
yeah
probably
uh-huh
that's right that's right
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
okay do you have you noticed any new trends in politics
oh really no i didn't hear that
i think sometimes it's good for people outside they get a different perspective on an issue and stuff so
yeah i don't see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved i think though that it should still be sort of up to the majority in the area i don't know on something like that they wouldn't really vote on it or anything though
probably so just because they were under his authority and he obviously failed somewhere along the line
yeah
oh
i think he's got good intentions but i'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right
right
uh-huh
oh i think that they should go ahead and go to the fourteen one i to me it's just fair you know and equal it seem like every area should have an equal voice
no
yeah
diane ragsdale
yeah
yeah they really make themselves look bad and i don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one
no huh-uh
yeah
okay was
well lots right
and
so we've done that for quite some time but since the price of paper has gone down like it's about a fifth of what it used to be
so the boy scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over
so now we just put ours out for the city of plano do you live in plano okay yeah
you
right
yes although just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs
yeah
like
yeah
uh-huh
right yeah we used to take ours there
i know
right i'm really glad they do it
i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really that are really dirty that you have to wash out
ha
wasting all your time and effort and putting it in there
yeah
got your routine down yeah
well i guess there are some places in the north in particular that have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle because they charge you
let's see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight
so if you recycle things of course then you don't have all that weight in there
right that's right
yeah
hm
right
well there are places that take car batteries but i wonder if they would take
yeah that's true
right that's true
when i was home those few days around thanksgiving and the
the truck came by well we all ran out to watch it because you know we'd never really seen it pick up our stuff and one thing i thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he scanned across the little bar code on our bin
as soon as he took the stuff and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just you know scanned it so i don't know why what that was reading it for
but they must be trying to keep track of you know who is doing it or what i guess i don't know another
oh for those who are really cooperating now that would encourage it
sure
but the garbage now there is just one garbage man that comes
on the truck instead of two
so that's interesting also slightly off the subject but our big green garbage thing got stolen
uh-huh
they brought us a new one and they did not charge us and they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen
isn't that sad you know it just
oh and they must be yeah really expensive i mean of course we were hoping we weren't we weren't going to have to pay for it you know but i mean what would somebody do with them
yes i live in dallas
are you in a house okay
has a lot more amenities i guess is the right word than the one that i moved out of this one
you know gave us free cable and ceiling fans and
it was practically new when i moved in here and the carpet was new and
no it's not a high-rise it's just a two story building
but there's you know there are a lot of buildings but it's just two stories
on the second floor they have they don't have a patio but they have a sunroom instead of the patio on the first floor where i am there's a patio
yeah the rooms are nice and large and
let's see i have i have two bedrooms
and
well i have a washer and dryer area and i did buy the washer and dryer but they didn't provide it the one that i moved from didn't have a place to put them and that's one of the reasons that i did move
so tell me
yeah
uh-huh just
it's real good
yeah it's a good time to buy if you're in the market
um-hum
oh so you want a bigger one
uh-huh one thing about the houses in dallas they don't utilize basements the way they did in new york
my parents in new york had
a three family house
actual actually it was a two family house where the
the downstairs and the second floor they had and then they rented the third floor with the whole
apartment
and
they had a basement and they
you know they finished the basement and they were able to rent that out also
but in dallas i just i just haven't seen basements in houses
and i've looked at a lot of them
no it's not
right
i haven't i haven't i have yet to see a basement in a house
there are some areas though where they have a problem with the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the
to the or the foundation sinking or something you know just a just a little bit some more than others
but you have to know the right spot to pick where that doesn't happen and
uh-huh
yeah
i see
huh where did you say you're at colorado
virginia that's right uh-huh anywhere near virginia beach huh
oh uh-huh
well different areas in dallas have different kind in texas i'll say because down in east texas there's a lot of red clay and
in the in the dallas you know fort worth city areas you don't see that
yeah
yeah well
uh-huh
yeah
oh
i see
um-hum
so is your house in an area by itself i mean
not connected to another one
oh
but it's not they're not connected are they uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i don't know how you feel about drug testing but i'm dead set against it
yeah i think about the only candidates that are out there that are you know anti antiwar on drugs or viv war on rights is pretty much your libertarian candidates which
i personally have some doubts as to whether any of them can get elected
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh well it just i mean really seems the ridiculous because
the u s department of labor i'm not sure might be a different agency requires businesses to post this poster that has like minimum wage laws and a bunch of other laws and one of the things it posts is
on the illegality of lie detector tests and you know i feel that lie detector tests are
well it means that there are limits there are there are definite government limits to you know how an employer can use lie detectors on its employees and i think that
oh i mean i agree that the lie detectors are inappropriate but i think you know that it's hard to justify being i don't understand how our government can encourage drug testing and discourage lie detector tests because they seem like they're testing the same sort of nebulous
character
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah
be similarly priced and you know if some if some guy goes to work and he had a had a fight with his wife the night before
and you know he has that on his mind and isn't gonna be able to function properly you know i just as you know i'd almost as you have as much fear of him driving the bus i'm riding than
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum and also on the question of you know just getting employment i'm you know i'm a senior in college and i'm applying for jobs and i know i know a lot of people that are doing it also and i know some of some of which that do indulge in certain
non sanctioned hobbies and their basic attitude toward drug testing is just moving away moving away from
you know the relatively harmless drugs like marijuana which you know lingers for about thirty five days to things like cocaine and lsd which you know one they don't test for well lsd they don't test for and cocaine which only stays in your system for about a week
and i used to snort i just you know wonder what effect this is having you know
and i and i mean that's you know that's entirely anecdotal evidence i know a couple people you know that have moved in the direction but
i just you know wonder you know overall what the trend is
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah and just the feeling that you know you the there there's
pressing in personal identification numbers all the atm machines things like that i personally don't own one because i can't afford one
every time you look in a friend's houses and they show you their computers and all the knickknacks they have it seems like they go from their basic computer to all these peripheral devices like modems and
fancy printers or lazy printers and fax machines and games that they like to play course i was impressed by some of the games they have like flight simular game simulator for the different aircraft
very close to it i understand
except for the bouncing around it
yeah i use a z248 286 at work but it's basically to tie into the communications network
then through our communications network we go to our mainframe on the base there
and use the unix operating systems
use their vi editor and we use read on line news through it
and we also have terminal emulations through ibm thirty two seventy eight
a window into there to the unix world
is that ibm or is that an ibm type
i'm familiar with unix commands like copying files and compressing them things like that i just have a fun time using their mainframe at the base but
you know i like i favor c shell over the other
i think i think most of our users like bourne shell because they were trained in it and they just don't wanna learn something different
pardon
oh yeah plus everybody in your office knows it and as the new people come in they kind of help each other out
and i understand it's only on like we use a gold 9050
and that's basically their format they use for word processing and they're trying to push people into using either
um-hum
does he live at home now and
um-hum yeah
no i know my mother my grandmother is still alive and feisty old lady she's really pretty good but she really just can't get around any more and she does have significant health problems
and my mom is looking after her and it it's a big drain on my mom i can tell when i when i get calls from her she sounds worn out
and it's tough on my grandmother because she's use to just
going to the store and getting what she wants and baking up things for her friends but now she's no longer where she grew up her friends have all passed on or in another city she can't just run right out and get things so a lot of these thing
fall on my mom go to the store get me this i want to go do that i've changed my mind phone calls in the middle of the night because she's lonesome yeah
yeah and you know i can see from a distance i'm not right there on top of it maybe i am a little bit more objective but
i would think that they would try like to try and find her some place that first of all she could be happy
yeah
yeah
yeah
you almost like to have some place that's almost hospice care but a little bit more independent than that almost like a community that has partly something like condominiums
where those people that are mobile can still retain their independence
but maybe have somebody come by and check on them once or twice a day bring them the groceries or come by and chat or whatever and then a hospice for those who no longer quite so mobile
the problem with everything else in health care is the cost
i mean that's almost why some of the you know the experimental cooperatives you hear about where people sort of throw in all their money together and do that sort of thing but it's
so they want to really make a method of it i wish that we could find some place for my grandmother she'd be happier
and my mother wouldn't have to drop everything and really she's lost a great deal of control of her life to the point where her own health is deteriorating
and that the stress is just enormous i feel for you you're one step closer than i am to it and it must be it must be really draining on you
oh
um-hum yeah
oh it right now though he's independent enough to take care of day to day or
oh
oh yeah
oh
somebody that comes and lives there and for the room and board takes care of people but
you need you need a contact service in the community i'd even be happy just
trying to find a day program that my grandmother would be willing to accept that she could go and spend the day meeting right now she tries to hold up in her apartment and the only people she
hobbies do you have
ah
do you do antiques
oh
oh my
ah
do you do all this in your house
oh
uh-huh
oh
boy that's an ambitious project
oh
so the neighbor was able to give you guidance
yes
well i do a lot of needlework
and i also do puzzles for magazines i get paid for this i've written two puzzle books
uh-huh and so in my free time even though it's not a hobby and that i do get paid for it i'm always developing new puzzles and activities and word games mind benders that type of thing
no they're variety type puzzles
not crosswords just all different kinds find the hidden word and you know anagram type puzzles acrostic cryptograms
i'm a writer for a living i write other things i'm a freelance writer
and i was a teacher for fourteen years and i'm not teaching because we've had to move around so much that i
no
i live in texas now but i'm from southern ohio originally
and we've lived in michigan and it seems like wherever i go i need to take forty hours of college in order to update my teaching credentials
so i decided i didn't want that to be my hobby any more after paying thousands and then moving the next year so now i'm just writing at home
yes
oh and what does she edit
oh
yes aba
oh
uh-huh that's right i knew some people going up there
oh well that
oh great
no i don't think so does she take in manuscripts like fiction to edit
because i'm in a large writers group here in dallas called dallas area romance authors do you live in the dallas area
oh you're from new york oh well there's a large group there too it's a national thing romance writers of america and they're always looking for freelance editors
okay i can send her some information about it because i know they mail manuscripts and
for a oh i think it's three chapters and a synopsis which would be around sixty pages the average price is around a hundred and fifty dollars for an editorial service
so okay i'll write this down and send it
oh good
yeah
okay let me take down the information and i'll send her who to who to send her credentials to
okay
two twenty five
and i like to run i'm like to run get my heartbeat up
i like to run about oh about two and a half miles and then i like to work out on the bailey life cycle machines up here at the at the holiday spa
and i think that you know i've had a regimen now for about you know ten fifteen years of doing that
and you know i kind of think it's a lot of work but i think it's the you know the amount of effort that's required
to stay healthy you know i have a sedentary job and unless you do something like that you know you're going to get sick
well i two years ago i started having trouble with my knee
and you know i've got a you know i figured well it'll go away well i you know i'm i've had to reduce my program reduce my program and i've gained fifteen pounds
and so you know it's you know i need to get back into swimming you know instead of running if i can't swim or i can't run i should be able to swim
well i'm such a terrible swimmer and i really feel i can i can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes to this effort but if it gets longer than that i it i start not doing anything
and so i got a real problem in that regard
it do you obviously are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it
well it's always a chore i mean i started doing this when i was about thirty five and now i'm fifty five
i need to lose fifty pounds you know i need to lose at least twenty you know but you know it's just i'm busy i'm doing a lot of traveling and it creates a problem you know when you're on the road
what sort of what other programs other than say running have you ever done anything at all
um-hum
well what club what club are you with
what club were you with
huh
okay so you're down you're downtown
okay yeah you're down there on you know twentieth and eighteenth and
f g
oh
well i'd well there's a there's a holiday spa down there on k street i think something like that
but i go to the holiday spa here in alexandria and that's pretty good but you know evening time it gets pretty busy
but generally you know i can i can get in and get a program in
but you know i need to i need to rededicate myself to doing this and i got a problem you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it i mean i've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
and you know and i'm i know i'm going to get i know it's going to bite me in the ass so i really don't want to want to you know back off on it
well no when you're young you can abuse your all your systems and you can recover
when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away
and just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye
you know and so the object of the game
okay so what are your opinion on it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
not much i'm twenty eight so no i really don't remember anything about it i guess i was about ten when it ended right
i was born in sixty two so when did it end
yeah
so i was ten and i don't remember a lot about
anything at that time in my life very much in great detail
no i didn't
but i did read the book i do have i have six years of college
so i did read and study about the vietnam war though so i am pretty you know i'm more familiar with it than
mine i think i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that
i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there
and to you know get rid of some of the atrocities that were going on
i don't i don't know i don't really i'm tired of pacifist though see on the other hand
i'm a i'm really struggling with it i'm a pacifist physical pacifist i'm a christian
and i believe that the real warfare is not with saddam hussein or the north vietnamese but it's in spiritual kingdoms
and that the real warfare is done you know in your prayer closet on your knees so
in a way in a sense i'm a pacifist but i'm really not you know what i'm saying
i don't think just lay back and not do anything i think lets go to war but let's go to war praying and let's go to war for that way so
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
still have a problem with you know i haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this but
and i know other christians would disagree with me my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this but we don't fight over it or anything but
you know how can you know the bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so it's like how can you
i don't know for me i don't know you know i can't say that i agree with vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and
and then shoot them
you so
um-hum
um-hum
yeah it is a difficult thing but then vengeance is mine sayeth the lord and i will pay
so i think god ultimately in charge of
what goes on in i know like mao tse chung in china he did all these terrible things and they were terrible and he's gonna be accountable for them
and but if you look back you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he tore down all the temples he
he unified the chinese language it was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in china
because of all that and so even in north and south vietnam i bet you'd see the same thing
and that now he build roads so then he'd open and then he dropped dead twenty five years premature he just dropped dead and so something good did come out of that in that
now you see what i mean it's like now
uh-huh
well bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him if he if he needs your asks for your shirt give him your coat also
so if the south vietnamese they asked us to help them right
is that right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah but then again yeah i'd say it is wrong to invade kuwait and i'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision i think i'm lacking in my
i don't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the vietnam war because i'm going to interpret that
through the bible and i've kind of always i have been a christian five years and i've kind of avoided that
that those the war things and how god approaches that
because i think its just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to come you know need to decide what i feel
right
right they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep yeah
i know
but then again though jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i'm saying like so he didn't just say don't kill your don't kill your enemies but don't only don't kill them bless them you know
and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like
but i really feel like i know i do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it
would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you
what can we do to rectify this situation
and that god would move in that sovereignly and he would get the glory though no king no bush wouldn't
because it wouldn't make any sense you know what i'm saying it'd look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because
if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because those are that's
the best way to do it you know but the thing is that then god gets the glory not a president not a king and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory
um-hum
this is where everyone always says my husband always goes through that i go yeah for one if someone broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to take authority over that
and i know people that have done that i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes
and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home illegally that's not normal
there's something going on there and that i would have discernment by the holy spirit to be able to pray over that
do you see what i mean and then the same in vietnam you would you wouldn't handle vietnam the same way you would handle saddam hussein
but i just i have a problem with all the killing but i'm not a new ager i don't believe
national identity and i'm an american and having different nations and all of this
but i am concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it than that and
well steve did you go to college
oh that's good so you probably could give some great advice
uh-huh
well what's your what's your interest your
uh-huh that that's similar to what i'm in a phd program right now
and my area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical i think than computer science but my area of expertise is human computer interaction
and i think that's one reason why i'm part of this study because it's of i'm working with voice systems
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i think that's more important probably than even the career vocation because most people change
i know very few people that started in one field and stayed with it
you know they i think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school
i think that's much more important i think i'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know that
some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer but some of the
small some of the larger small schools you know i guess around three or four thousand students have a can offer a broader range of curriculums and things so if the kid does change they don't have to transfer or they don't have to
i don't know they don't have to give up years of you know of credit transfer and things
i normally and parents hate to hear this you know because i actually teach college i hate to
one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation
that make sense
yeah i always you know tell them that you should major in something you you're going to get good grades in because that that's always i think more important
you know overall
i don't know
yeah oh you you're at the office now you are at work yeah
and the public schools here are pretty good i teach at a public school actually and i know that the sat scores for our admitting
freshmen are higher than a lot of the public a lot of the private schools and i actually i would full time at a at a public school and then right now i'm teaching part time at a private school at a catholic institution
because i think their parents pay more and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated
where at the public school i don't think as many parents are public are college educated and i don't i think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious
but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private you know i you have to really you have to look around at the school i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for
um-hum
right
uh-huh
um-hum
right
right yeah does it have a big ten football team or is it
yeah i mean yeah is it a pac ten school you know but i think yeah see i'm at the university of maryland so in this region
though i go to a smaller branch of the university of maryland my diploma will still say university of maryland
you know one step below mit in a since you know so it's got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school and technical people know that
but i don't yeah i think you're right you really have to think about that for the job i went to a very small state college when i got my bachelor's
and when i now i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs i was going to be a teacher i was just a high school teacher so
for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know shippensburg state where is that you know and you know when i went into higher education even at other universities they weren't aware of it you know
um-hum yeah
right
um-hum
right
yeah depending on your technical areas yeah i could see that but you know at some of the large schools i know that at university of maryland where i am you know in a phd program i haven't even met someone outside of
my area of information systems except for
oh
um-hum
do you have a family
that helps
um-hum
um-hum
that won't be much longer
yeah
well actually i haven't it's funny i haven't been looking at all i mean because i'm a grad student and
and my wife's got an eighty seven
which basically our plan is to wait another year until i'm done with graduate school and then sell the bonneville for whatever we can get for it and go out and buy a new car some place else and i think
we i'm sort of stuck i want half of me wants some sort of little sporty thing just for the hell of it because it may be the last time i can drive one for a long time and the other half of me says be pragmatic and get some sort of
probably small economical car for a couple of years and then get something bigger like a minivan when we have kids and stuff or when we travel a lot
right
yeah
right well it's a it's a it's note like the i've seen that mazda van and it seems like it would be the right thing then
right
oh okay that'll be nice
oh okay
right
that's just yeah it's thinking ahead
it's real good
that'll give you a little extra
yeah
yeah it's actually a real nice feeling
i grew up driving the suburban and then recently i test drove
for some strange reason i test drove a range rover
not because i was going to buy a forty thousand dollar jeep mind you
but just but because my wife works for a agency and
they and they had a job and they called me basically i basically i was shopping the agent to make sure you know he was doing good things by range rover you know
they sent me out as a to sort of act like i wanted to buy one
basically and then report back to the company as to how the salesman is doing
so i had to act like a buyer and
yeah it's a neat little it's
it's sort of like being a scab i guess in a sense but i used you know i mean he did a wonderful job so i just went back and said wonderful things about him you know but we went and part of it was test driving a range rover and i realized afterward you know it's a real nice ride because it's nice you're nice and high
lots of clearance and stuff like that like you said but
forty thousand yeah that's just way too much for a jeep in my opinion
no i wouldn't i mean i would get if i wanted to pick out a car like that i'd go for a bronco or you know blazer or something i figure it's
yeah
yeah
oh yeah this is nothing i mean he was showing me they had this i was you know they had they had a beamer there that was seventy eight thousand and a mercedes that was ninety
you know and the man claimed that he sold fourteen of these mercedes the previous year
it was amazing
yeah
it totally and i can't imagine what's that much better about them that
right
yeah i agree
it'd be nice to think that i could afford it mind you but
yeah no i wouldn't
i was going to say a volvo at eighty five thousand miles is still being broken in isn't it
i mean
yeah aren't those the ones that have is it volvo or saab that has like the three hundred thousand mile club and
and the car's probably still fine right
right
it's wonderful
yeah
that's nice to have no payments yeah
um-hum
that's great you've really thought this out it sounds like i mean i'm sort of you know i sort of look around and go yeah that's a nice car that's a nice car but i haven't really
to be paying for a car
that's true
that's that that's real true actually
that's actually it's got it's actually it's low on mileage given that it's eighty two it's only got seventy five thousand on it and
or seventy four or whatever you know and it's in it's a funny coincidence that my cousin sold me the car
i can't open it has electronic windows unfortunately electric windows and doors and the
and the passenger window is gone you know it doesn't open any more but i'm not going to fix it because i'm going to sell it in a year
yeah it's seventy five dollars for the motor alone
and then another seventy five to install it you know so that can that that's crazy or like the air conditioning went the air conditioning sort of blowing warm air so i went down to the you know my local mechanic and for forty dollars they did an air conditioning check and they
went through everything i told them to put in a shot of freon and they said yeah it needs a shot of freon but then he came back and he said well the reason you're losing the freon is because you have a leak in this condenser line and when and that's a hundred and fifty dollars to fix that and then while we're in there we have to change this and this and you know and
so it would have wound up costing me close to four hundred dollars but he said look if you're selling the car in a year don't bother doing it all he said i'll give you a shot of freon every now and then and you're fine you know so
yeah no it's olds actually olds yeah that's actually a real good car i'm finding it's mechanically is very sound
unfortunately the body was rust proofed by a company called rusty jones
which i'm not sure if you've ever heard of or not but
rusty jones went out of business because their rust proofing wasn't very good
and now i've got some i mean the eighty two has
no rust at all and the eighty seven has some pretty big rust spots on it so it's
so and
yeah actually we're looking forward to getting out of here
we're yeah in a year i'm done and then we're moving south or west
or southwest
and our topic i guess tonight is on capital punishment and how we feel about that
if you don't mind how do you feel about capital punishment
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that way it can be a deterrent
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh great
the response yeah
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
right
yes
right i tend to agree with you i'm kind of torn between two items however i definitely believe in due process that if a person is found guilty
so that we're not ramrodding a guilty verdict on them that it's up for review in the appeal process
however i tend to agree with you that well i don't tend to agree with i definitely agree with you that
there are people that are going to make sure that every t is crossed every i is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality now
not only in the courts is that costing us
money and millions and millions of dollars and wasting our taxpayers and clogging up the courts but also
the detectives the homicide detectives and so forth when they're researching when they are gathering the evidence they're bending over backwards
in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened
and the guy is as sound mind and so forth he's not an idiot he wasn't acting i don't know you know in that case
we're spending money in the in the judicial system we're spending money in the law enforcement area trying to verify all this kind of information
and the and the individual's guilty i believe that if we have cash capital punishment that it should be executed swiftly
that it should be taken care of not after seven levels of appeal but after a couple levels of appeal
under certain circumstances
those circumstances would be
so martin how do you feel about crime in the city you said you're from atlanta
um-hum
um-hum
i mean do you do you find crime in atlanta really bad i mean i live in atlanta also
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
um-hum
i'd probably agree with that
um-hum
yeah that's probably true
so well do you think atlanta is as bad as most other cities
um-hum
um-hum i don't think it's as bad as la either
we i don't think we don't we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
i know i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just keeping your senses about you and you trying not to look like a victim
you know
you know walk you know walk with you know with
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
and if you have you ever have you ever been mugged in atlanta
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i've been pretty lucky about getting mugged i don't
yeah i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun
and that's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i've seen in atlanta and that and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
oh really
wow where was where was that was that downtown or
really
um-hum metropolitan yeah
yeah i've actually i've known some people that have had their cars stolen
and you know but half the time they seem to
um-hum
well you're probably luckier than
um-hum
so does like insurance pay for the body damage or was that was that all it was body
um-hum
um-hum
so how do you know this much about stealing cars
well we usually go fishing at toledo bend
and my parents they're the fishermen in and my brother i usually don't do too much fishing i usually take my raft and float along behind the boat and get a suntan
but they love to crappie fish my brother likes to bass fish so
for crappie they use shiners
and bass my brother usually puts a jig or something like that on there for it or a top water bait you know usually artificial bait for bass
and then we sometimes get crickets and they fish for bream
and
yeah you haven't
um-hum
bream
uh-huh and also they have these wasp
the
larvae is that what it's called wasp larvae
and oh anytime we can find those my parents just scoop up on those because they are so good for fishing
and they use those a lot but usually it's either shiners or
okay
no we usually don't do i mean they catch catfish i keep saying they because i never fish but
they catch catfish you on accident sometimes
and then whenever we do trot lines and stuff they usually get catfish
usually not too big probably maybe two or three pounds you know i've seen some huge catfish
the bottom yeah um-hum
well we used to just have a little aluminum boat but my dad has sold it so he's hunting a boat now i think he's looking into bass tracker
he found him one last weekend that he really liked but we haven't gotten it yet so
oh i agree
that's right
we're talking about fishing today daddy
oh
oh
oh
yeah
well i just do not have the patience for it but i mean we usually keep our fish that are right size you know that are a good eating size because my parents love to eat fish but
yeah and catch them next time yeah
uh-huh
oh great
they are so expensive
oh i love to ski
yeah
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah
yeah we usually do usually in the springtime or in the fall in the
yeah the summer time's a little too hot
we usually go pitch a tent and we stay out there for the weekend or for the week matter of fact i think we're going to go again in may
the middle of may we're planning a trip down to toledo bend and sometimes we rent a trailer and then
it's between the texas and louisiana border
daddy what's the nearest big city to toledo bend
he says its exactly half way between shreveport and dallas
it's
it usually takes us we it takes about an hour or an hour and a half for us to get there daddy
yeah and then my brother will meet us half way since he works you know he lives in dallas he usually meets us half way and
i go to school i go to lsu
communications
oh
uh-huh
well gosh thanks
yeah i sure do i try to i mean
oh
well great
yeah i also try to follow tech louisiana tech the
yeah they are
oh
uh-huh
i want to be a cruise director
yeah kind of i guess
i'd like to do that for a few years and then whenever i get settled down i would like to go back and teach college i'd like to be a professor
yeah i'm gonna go ahead and go straight in and get my master's degree
no i'm gonna go to i'm gonna check into the university of colorado
because they have a special program a one year's master's program where i can get my master's in one year
so
i think it's thirty six yeah
um-hum it i mean it's going to take a lot of hard work but you need
uh-huh
um-hum
that's what everybody has said because once you get out and make that money it's so hard to get back into it
yeah
well what are your degrees in
oh goodness
what kind of movies have you been seeing lately
oh it's an excellent movie
silence of the lambs
what was that anyway because i didn't get a chance to see it
okay
um-hum
let's see who was in fisher king
that was
robin williams and
and i can't say the other fellow's name
we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately we really enjoyed
dead poet's society
several years back when we saw we saw the we really enjoyed was ordinary people
with
timothy hutton and mary tyler moore and
who played the father anyway excellent movie
yes we have
oh we loved it
yeah pretty impressed with stuff he's done he made kind of an odd sounding robin hood but
but
oh no it was a good movie
well they did a real good job with it
they didn't try to make him super human or you know invincible
they just
he worked hard at it
no i haven't not had the opportunity to see that
yeah
yeah
it sounds kind of like one we saw at home here on the rented it clara's heart
it's whoopi goldberg
yeah she played a
they
she was a housekeeper yeah she's a housekeeper she
she was
oh no i can't say it not haitian
anyway
she
she seemed to be that sort of person that you know about seems half crazy but then again she's got a whole lot on the ball and the movie had the whole a lot of philosophical content more than
more than you know it wasn't a mystery it wasn't a you know blood and guts and violence and car chases type thing
it was just a good movie
a kiss before dying
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable but still worth watching
not familiar with that one
oh okay
so what kind of benefits do you have in your job that you think is very important
health care like dental
uh-huh
right
so just this so you think that the a good company will provide good health
right
i hear that's like one of the major the major costs to corporations nowadays
um-hum
right
see the problem i have with it is that i don't have a job
and so i don't i don't know firsthand of these benefits
but i do agree with you that health insurance is one of the major ones i don't know about dental i mean
dental is kind of like you know you're asking for too much
to for me i think it's like
you know you're expecting too much from a company if something happens it happens and they'll pay you for it but
to actually have you know big coverage for something like that
right i'm only twenty one
um-hum
right
exactly yeah
um-hum
as health
right so for a health insurance what do you think would be a good health insurance with a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible
uh-huh i guess it also depends on how many times you're going to use it
right
right so
uh-huh
too expensive more expensive for them to do that then
um-hum so that's pretty good
um-hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they're going to pay for then i should really look really deep into the policy
the very first thing i should look at huh
no not yet
um-hum
what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger
and that's scary because you know in the end you're getting insurance for basically nothing
yeah
yeah
that sounds like a big asset to do that
well it's been nice talking to you
i guess i'll maybe see you again sometime
you too bye
thirty minutes or an hour on i
been to rio europe
uh-huh
yeah i was
i was lucky enough when i was twenty years old back when the dollar was really strong i mean it was you know still the keen currency i convinced my parents to let me take off a month and go backpacking in europe
and
well jeez if i had to pick one country i guess i would have to say italy
uh-huh i think so because it was just the history was just so staggering whenever you know you walked into the coliseum
and you realized how many thousands of years old it was you know and you could just imagine the gladiators and the lions and it was you know
pretty staggering to think of and then of course then the roman forum that's even older than that that's just ruins and but the food was good the people were nice and there was just so much to see and do
for less than a thousand dollars
yeah
right and i and i stayed gone a month
yeah now of course that was back when arthur for this the writer arthur frommer had a book out it was called europe on five dollars a day
and so we budgeted and we said well we'll be extravagant we budgeted ten dollars a day
and we kept in that budget and had just really perfect
i went with a friend of mine that i'd been in high school with actually he and i we were in college at the time and we were talking about going to colorado taking a little trip up to colorado that summer after school got out
and we started adding up you know totaling how much it was going to cost and i said hell we could go to europe for that he said well why don't we and i said you know we did i'm really happy that we did do that
well and i've been to england several times since then
and that is i could go back anytime
anytime
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
well
well i
had a job for several years that i traveled just an awful lot
and as a matter of fact i stayed gone more than i stayed at home yeah for about four years and i built up an awful lot of mileage so i've made three trips to london just using airfare you know airline mileage and so that's how i've been able to make those trips
i would go back to if i could go back anywhere right now i think i would go back to edinburgh
well because we i didn't go any farther north
beautiful and it's a part of the country that's a little bit off the beaten path there're not as many tourists that go out there and i enjoyed
scotland so much but i could go back listen i could go back into london any day of the week and the beautiful thing about that is
you could take a train out of london and head any direction it doesn't make any difference and take these fabulous day trips and anywhere you go is interesting
and
the last time we went we found this really
small kind of quaint hotel actually we found it over there on the trip before but stayed in it the last time that was reasonable and just used that as a base and then took day trips on the trains the train system is wonderful which makes me
wonder when we'll ever get our act together here in the us and have a and have a decent transportation system but we'd just take day trips and that was that was a nice way to do it
i have been yeah we went the first time i went over there i went to germany and went to munich and stayed right across the street from one of the original medieval beer halls
and
how do you how do you generally find out what's going on in the world
oh okay
okay
yeah
i used to have i used to have cable and the thing that i really miss
since i lost cable and there's that not that much on there that i miss but
headline news was always good because i could get a quick roundup of whatever the top topics were in like a half hour span and in around the world in thirty minutes i think was their big thing
and the other thing i used to i miss is cnn used to go a little bit more in depth you would get like crossfire you would get you know different perspectives from usually from like the left and the right liberal and conservative
arguing the various
i think patrick buchanan who's now running for president used to be the conservative side for that
i can't think of the name of the guy that represented the left
yeah
um-hum
yeah that's actually on a network isn't it
that's exactly right
and see because i've run into that a couple of times on accident and ended up watching it for like extended periods of time but that's how i get most of my news is
um-hum
um-hum
the only thing that scares me about the way i do news is
getting it from like these pre digested sources you know like the like the
typically what i've heard maybe it's just the people i hang around with but typically i hear people saying that like
the news on tv and what not tends to be more on the left hand side it tends to be a little bit more liberal and if nothing else it does tend to be more editorialized than these are the facts
true too
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
but see i think you and i perhaps i think well i get the feeling that you and i perhaps might take the time to try and figure out exactly what really happened as opposed to what they're telling us even though they maybe close
but i wonder how much of the rest of america takes the time to stop with just the straight spoon fed you know
yeah well especially when you figure what a third of the people that bother to vote always vote republican a third of the people that bother to vote always vote democrat
well good what kind of singer are you
oh really do you do you sing in a group or
oh tell me what that is
oh
oh yeah
and so you stand up in front of the
and where and are you looking at the words
so that everybody sees it
do they sing along
well how cute so that way that keeps them from being able to have other or other musicians
uh-huh
well that and so you get up and sing it yourself
uh-huh
huh
and then the paperwork and all of that but generally where i am i
i this has been the best situation in terms of not having a lots of discipline problems and having children that really are pretty interested in music in general
so it's really been nice but
yeah it it's and i think that's a real valid reason for not majoring in it my boys
not even like in church choir
um-hum uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah things that they have you do during high school
uh-huh ooh
really
i can't remember i've only done this one other time
are you doing this as a fund-raiser
uh-huh
um-hum
and it's supposed to you know be a
a really i mean a lot of they've already made a lot of money on it
so isn't that
yeah
okay and i'm up in wisconsin my name is terry
and in the small town we don't but we're not that far from the city where there's tons of
okay just in particular here in the twin cities we have a lot of big corporations and i'm sure there's a lot of pollution we before moving to wisconsin lived across from where they were
gravel pits and also where they were making tar and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar and
it would smell the continuous you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs so and it was like miles away but just the idea of having that
come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that but
also where we also lived too it was very close to a highway so we got a lot of fumes from trucks
and cars and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture i mean it was on your tables you would dust every day and it was dirty
type of dust i mean it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country
so
oh yeah it comes right on through the screens the only way that you could
actually live in the in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house
and so it was quite a dirty city if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution
then you're fine but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises you have lots of other things that are not
catching the pollution and it's just going for miles and miles and miles and it's landing somewhere with the wind but
sure
sure
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh sure yeah it's i mean our air quality
in the twin cities is a lot better than what we've heard about california and maybe in
the other areas but they were always talking about the air quality of today is this you know the ozone or whatever and it's kind of scary because air is something we take for granted
and many people are too busy getting to work not thinking about okay i could have carpooled with a friend even
my husband was talking to some of the guys at work now he's fifteen miles away from work but he was talking wouldn't it be nice to carpool and the guy says well it's too close it wouldn't pay and so
yeah and
exactly and so my husband says well that's fine you know it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and you know the gas
and no everybody has their preference to drive by themselves or if they do they
they drive with one little buddy at least it's with one person but most of the time people are saying forget it i don't want to carpool it's too much of a hassle it's too much involvement but yet
yes we are and i think of my daughter and i'm sure you think of your children and you kind of say to yourself
but they have to change attitudes
um-hum
sure
um-hum
sure
sure
well brent i've been
i kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because i thought if it it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school
and i thought it was a good sacrifice to make
because it was important to me to spend some time with kids i know that when i was in school and getting my degree at the same time my husband was it was really hard on our family because i would
he would come home and i would leave and then when i would come home and he would leave and
so i think one day one of our kids said you know someone came home and they said well when is dad leaving or something it was like that they thought that's the way life was that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time
and so i think it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family
so there's one or two nights a week we have a on monday nights we set aside time where it's called family home evening and we stay home that evening all of us and we do things together
yes
oh you are
yes and
so you do that and right and then we try to do a family activity on saturday usually in the morning
right and then you know sometimes we try to do our lesson on sunday night and then our activity or something on monday but
we're it's real important to us to spend time together
i have two
um-hum
i have a girl and a boy and the boy's five he's in kindergarten and the girl is four she'll be in kindergarten next year
um-hum
um-hum
hum uh-huh
they are a handful
uh-huh
um-hum
yes
um-hum
um-hum
well no and it's just not it's not as stable for the kids and they everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now but it's yeah
well it's also important i think for my husband i try to go out of my way to plan things that he can do with the kids because
since i am home with them and so i get a lot of time with them he needs to have some time with them so he when he comes home he
you know it's his job at night he puts the kids to bed and he reads
to them and he spends about an hour doing that and that's pretty good quality time with them and but it's hard for him on saturdays he wants
right he wants to run out and get things done and so
i try to say well why don't you go fly kites or why don't you do something and
if i have something in mind then he remembers that that's what he wants to do
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
yes
um-hum
well that's right
but i do think you know like the current trends are that the family unit is devaluated it's not nearly as important we find that
you know back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems the first place they went to was their family and families took care of themselves and
but now you know people don't they don't support each other that way
um-hum
that's right and
right and it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make because you know i you know i have interests
that too and it is hard to make those interests not be as a major part of my life
um-hum
uh-huh
right
it is temporary it in the middle of it seems like a long time but you're right it is temporary
well i see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids and in spite of
um-hum
yes
that's true
um-hum
yes
well it is the hardest thing i've ever done as much as you'd go out
and
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's good
um-hum
no
yeah i think so i think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not
not religious you can at least say that it's important to our country that our family unit stays strong
um-hum
yes
hi my name is donna donahue
yes
okay i have a cold this morning so you have to excuse my sound here i'm from plano texas where are you from
oh okay that's nice and easy let's see would you like to start or would you okay
okay
i love to cross stitch and my husband and my son who is now eleven watch so much sports on tv that lately i have been
just in a cross stitch frenzy because i cannot stand being in the same room with the tv on with all the sports so much that i have to sit i can sit there as long as i'm cross stitching and
while i'm doing that so that that's one of my favorite hobbies that i that i like to what about you
okay
oh
i do too i
yes
it is i enjoy it too and i have found a wonderful framer on fifteenth street down in old plano about two doors down from nooks and crannies
who does he's really an artist and he does a wonderful job with i just give him my things and he triple mats everything and he has really nice frames
very reasonable i have brought something to michaels and i was very disappointed in it and it was just a small little picture for my daughter's room in fact there were two little cross stitches i did for her room and
apparently two people framed them differently they two people took instead of one person doing the framing two people did it because the mats were just different sizes and to put them next to each other it just didn't look right and
he is so reasonable that and he has all these unusual frames that he uses his name is i guess i can just tell you his name it's matt inc
and it's i think the address is ten eleven and a half on fifteenth because it's a skinny little door next to i think bows and
yes closer to the right down from nooks and crannies and it's matte m a t e inc i n c period
and he does such a beautiful job i'll take something in i do simple cross stitches mostly samplers and a few that are a little bit more complicated but i don't really with three kids running around it's hard for me to get something too intricate
so i like something that's kind of quick and i love i like doing the samplers i have a whole wall of them and he'll just take this sampler which is just you know mediocre not so great and when he puts the colors he picks out little bits of
colors that he'll pick from your from your work and matte it with that little color and it just it just makes this wonderful piece of art
so i'm real happy with them and they have some really nice books down there have you seen the books in the small shops in and
on fifteenth street you know i'm fairly new to the area so i'm always glad to find a nice little shop that has different books but
do you uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
do you now i really usually don't get the real expensive linens to work on which maybe that's what you do it's probably really beautiful to do that but i just get the regular piece of cloth you know and do it on that but
oh okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
how neat
oh we moved into our home about thirty three years ago
and at the time it was a small ranch style it had two bedrooms on the main floor and then the basement wasn't finished but we have since finished the basement we've added a car port and we've added a big family room
oh i would think most of the homes in utah do
yes we got about three inches of snow last night the snow plows have been out and my husband's been out shoveling the snow
so but ours is typical for the neighborhood but
no i have arthritis
no in the summer time for about oh a month we could use air-conditioning but i have arthritis and i don't i don't like air-conditioning
but we
i know i've been to my son's in august and i hated it
uh-huh
oh we had we have had six children
and so our house was small to start with but we added three bedrooms in the basement and like i say added on to it so
it's pretty typical did you have help designing it or was that part of what you do
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's kind of the way ours is too
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
that sounds lovely
i've always wanted another bedroom upstairs and then i we've never had a bathroom off the master bedroom and i would like that
oh does she
but like i say our children live a long way away and so our family room i quilt in there a lot
it's big enough that we it was eighteen by twenty when we added it on
so it's big enough for that but
okay so during the summertime do you dress differently than you would when school's going on
yeah
oh really
oh yeah
oh yeah
oh yeah
yeah they're very nice do you can you get away with wearing the shorter ones style the ones that really look like shorts kind of
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well my husband was laughing at me one day because my dresses i when i dress to go to work my dresses are pretty long and
yeah it's pretty comfortable i had never done that and i just i could not find any hose anywhere so
the one day that i did it and i got caught
no i really don't my i work for a computer company but it's not real visual i mean it's not like an ibm where you have to wear your blue suit
but i can get away with wearing dresses a lot which i really enjoy
because especially i mean you know it's nice sometimes in a suit because if you're hot inside or cold or you know whatever you have your jacket but i'm more comfortable in a dress
so but
the best thing are you from texas
yeah
um-hum
yeah
well that's really weird because last winter i bought my first cardigan that i ever remember buying and i only got to wear it like twice all winter long so
well yeah oklahoma and texas so i mean oklahoma did get colder in the winter but i guess i just didn't notice it because i never really dressed very warm so
yeah
yeah
well and i found a new dressmaker so that i just am crazy about the style of the dresses so
it's called rabbit and they are the neatest dresses they just are very flattering to your figure and
i've been fortunate i've found them in a catalog and then they're a lot cheaper than you can find them at dillard's
so
yeah they do have them at dillard's and
yeah i really enjoy them i've and it's real funny too because i've had a lot of compliments on them when i wear them so
yeah
well i'm short and i've been told that if you wear the longer skirt it gives you it gives you more of an elongated look
so i've always been more comfortable in the longer ones
so
but anyway but i don't have any play clothes because i spend all my money on clothes that i wear to work
so on the weekends and
yeah but it's just kind of frustrating because on the weekends you want to go out to play and you don't have any play clothes
so i need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts i think where then that way i could at least wear the shirts on the weekend
put them with my shorts or something
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well that's something my husband says what are we going to do when we finally do have kids and you have to move out of one of those because i have both of the guest bedrooms are both my rooms and it's like what are we going to do
said well we'll have to get a bigger house
oh i know and then well my sisters have had their children and so now they send their baby clothes and all their stuff down here to me
yeah they definitely are but it will be nice if we ever do have kids because then i've got the whole wardrobes and fortunately she's had a boy and a girl
so that worked out yeah
oh yeah i can imagine
oh
yeah
um-hum
yeah definitely
oh god yeah i can imagine
uh-huh
oh
oh my gosh
uh-huh
wow
on sale
oh my gosh
oh my gosh
oh my gosh
uh-huh
wow
oh no
i just can't imagine
yeah really well my mother had three girls but i don't remember being that picky about my
do you have a favorite television program
uh-huh
okay
oh no kids that's a surprise that you watch the prime time family show like that
i really miss cheers i watch that one on a regular basis
uh-huh
okay
yeah it took me a while to get used to rebecca but i actually like the newer shows better than the old ones now
yeah i like comedies a lot movies and sports programs in particular
right in fall i watch a lot of football
yeah i've got hbo right now
i like cinemax better they usually have more movies but i take whatever they offer for a dollar for the next month
and then cancel it after awhile
oh couple hours a day i guess
yeah a little bit more on weekends because of the sports programs
depends a lot on what's on cable for the movies
i do get tired of watching movies on network tv with all the commercial interruptions
yeah they sure are i get tired of that too see the same ones over and over again
no what's that show about
sounds complicated
i'll have to tune in sometime
okay
make sure i catch that one of these weeks
yeah i'm just i've got wide world of sports on right now
oh i've seen that that's a good movie
i've never really watched that show i'm not too taken up with bill cosby i've been told or by other people that it's really a white folks show
upper middle class and i don't know i never really got interested in it much
he did the fat albert comedies for the most cartoons right
you watch cartoons besides that
i catch them on saturday mornings every now and then watch teenage mutant ninja turtles
oh it's interesting
i
i haven't seen either one of them yet the second one is showing right now i guess in the theaters and the first one's going to be on cable next month i believe
how about johnny quest
yeah another show that i watch is the wonder years do you ever see that
he gets into a lot of stuff
right well it brings back a lot of memories too because of the music that they play in the show
uh-huh
okay well you're probably more interested in the simpsons then
don't care for that type of humor
it it's pretty bizarre
do you watch any news type shows like 60 minutes
yeah i watch those expose also is good
how about talk shows
well i catch sally jesse raphael at night nine o'clock on channel twenty seven
and
right
yeah
is that right okay
yeah
well they have really bizarre topics on there just the other
uh-huh
well they have topics that i've never seen on any other type talk shows the other night they had people who were victims of bad dates
and you get to see a lot of different perspectives on what people what's on their minds
but they're always coming up with something strange and they claim it's not sensationalism type reporting or journalism but i think it is it's anything to get the viewers interested
i can't say it's not entertaining though
uh-huh
with mary hart and leeza gibbons
i don't watch that much
okay
so the nba basketball play-offs will be coming up real soon within the next two weeks
and i just got done with the nc double a tournament i was glued to the tv for two weeks
but sports is always fun
yeah well
right well i like tv because of instant replay and you really do get what i think you get a better perspective because of the coverage number of cameras that they have setup at the events
and there aren't the distractions that you find in the with the crowds actually being at a game
and you can get up and get something to eat whenever you feel like and come back to the tv or tape it and watch it later
my vcr doesn't get an awful lot of use right now but
should be taping more movies right now
i think next month cable's going to have a couple more good movies on i think the hunt for red october is on next month on hbo i haven't seen that one yet and that's supposed to be very good
okay
so how do you feel about capital punishment
right you don't think
i have a the same dilemma i think it's you know it seems right sometimes and then other times you don't know
right
right
um-hum
and also it doesn't seem like it does them any harm i mean sure their life is taken but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway so i think sometimes they'd prefer just to
get it over with so it's more of the easy way out than
making them pay for the for the
you know what they've done
yeah
um-hum
right but then again also you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway so
it doesn't it seems by that by
i don't know doesn't ever really
pay
yeah
right it doesn't bring back every
what state are you in
oh really in dallas
oh really
right now i'm in utah but i'm from plano texas
so
what are the laws like in texas it's
oh really
uh-huh
wow
i haven't no
and they do it that way
huh
wow
yeah i think that they're i think that capital punishment is in utah also i'm not really familiar with
yeah i am
they do it by like a bunch of men have guns and one of them has the real gun in it so they don't know who killed
right
i think
yeah i know
well what do you think about it
no i don't either
i don't think it's going to change very much but
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
well you know the funny thing i find about american opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the american public goes crazy
and now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in iraq they're going crazy you know i mean you can't please them one way or the other
you know and i and i think that i agree with you this is exactly the right course i mean that's an internal problem to iraq it has nothing to do with us
and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the un gets involved then it's nobody's business
all the time i mean yeah i mean
yeah
yeah and it's certainly and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years and it's going to continue as long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time
i mean the kurds have tried it before they've gotten their butts kicked and this is just another time that it's happening
you know they'll regroup out in the mountains and they'll try it again in a couple of years
sure and i don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it
you know
but i i'm not real sure that we promised them anything
i that would have been stupid and i and i don't think we did it everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right i don't think they would have done that
but
it just it really doesn't make any difference this is just a another chapter in middle eastern history
oh sure i mean the british occupied the place the french occupied it we've done it ah it it's happened so many times this is this is really nothing special
that's right it's all it's mostly religious anyway
yeah
yeah exactly
well i think one of the big problems i mean looking at it from the american public's standpoints they don't understand the middle easterners
they don't understand what i mean their politics really isn't politics it's religion couched as politics
and there's a big difference
you know we sit there and we think that they think the way we think
um-hum
yeah
yeah
that's it a lot of the time i was stationed in turkey for a year and a half
and it was tough understanding those folks
you know they they're so completely different culturally and socially and
and religiously it's just it was very strange it was very interesting
now i shoot i think some of these people that they claim as middle eastern experts don't have a clue sometimes
you know they sit there and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert well i'm not real sure that's appropriate
no
well i sort that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too
and we make experts by reading books you know
and the japanese and the germans and everybody else make experts by doing
yeah
yeah
i
i guess you work for ti yeah
so you guys are well aware of the problems with the japanese markets and everything else
yeah
it's like our car industry the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the japanese
you know came into it and helped us out
um-hum
yeah and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean
we're going to be we're we've already been overtaken but it's going to get even worse later i mean looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the math and the science and everything it's not us
you know we we've got folks running around here who get who get degrees in basket weaving and
you know underwater psychology or some ridiculous stuff like that
and where are the engineers coming from
yeah exactly
my roommate is a he's getting his doctorate in industrial well it's not industrial engineering it's human factors his degree was in you know industrial engineering
and he's from the philippines
and the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it
he has no intention of going back to the philippines because there's no jobs
you know but i see it all too often i mean we've got loads of foreign students
and they're coming here going after the hard degrees and then they're going back to korea and japan and hong kong and everywhere else and they're applying it there
and
i don't know it's to me it's amazing i don't know what we're going to do as a country we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later
um-hum
yeah you
i don't i don't think there can be anymore long range planning i think it it's sticking your finger in the holes and the dike
you know oh here's a crisis well let's plug it up
i don't know i don't know what the answer is it's far beyond me
yeah all we can do is keep plugging
you know i wonder i
read in the paper just last week ibm's unveiling their new laptop computer
well at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers
now i have the i have the ibm ps two
but i'm sorry i got it
it's slow it's there are many better machines on the market right now for
a the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan through the school and i saved forty eight percent so i said yeah if i can have an ibm for forty eight percent discount i'll take it
but up to that point i had i had always said i would never have one because i wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name
but
now you watch just sure as anything the japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it
um-hum it's already outdated
yeah
yeah i can imagine
put all the money into the expansion box and
all this that and the other and
so i just at an opportune time i got one that suited my needs and i've just stuck with it the only thing i've done to it is just add a add a mouse and a hard drive
and that's all i plan to do of course i'm limited on memory now because i've got the low line i got the model twenty five
so i'm stuck with six forty but i'm not a power user so it doesn't matter
yeah
yeah now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user
he's looking now to get rid of his he's got a three eighty six and wants to get a four eighty six you know this kind of stuff
oh so what's your favorite exercise
oh that's pretty good exercise you do you drive a cart or do you carry your bag
yeah it gets a long ways after a while
oh let's see i play racquetball mostly
and fractured it on both sides and so it's kind of weak i'm afraid to get out there and try it again
do they give the employees time off during the day to go
a lot of places do that now they'll set aside you know like an hour a day that you can go exercise
that's a pretty good idea because people who take advantage of it end up in better health and saves them on health care
yeah i like bowling too i haven't been for a while just don't have the time
but
i guess bowling and racquetball's about it for me walking every once in a while but
not a great deal of that
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
and it it's just so you either have to wait or
you're next to league bowlers and after a while it just gets to be a pain
yeah
yeah especially here in raleigh we've got such little bitty bowling alleys
little bitty everything here
yeah a friend of mine works at ibm in charlotte
and they've got a real nice building down there on a great big piece of land
and it's a huge plant i mean this thing's just enormous and that's what they do at lunch time they go out and run around the building
i'm not i was never into jogging
i hated that when i was in high school playing football coach was always making us run
yeah i just sort of hated it from that point on
well
yeah it's that's a tough one to play i used to play it when i was younger but
took it out of me then and i'd hate to think what it would do to me now
yeah i got to stick to more sedate sports
as soon as i as soon as i can find me an ankle a good a good ankle brace i'm going to start playing some racquetball again but i'm not going out there with an unsupported ankle anymore
i'm tired of running around on crutches for two months at a time
and i'm not lucky enough to just go ahead and break it you know the things got to get fractured so that it never heals properly
well i've got a pair of those that's those are the ones that i wear when i go out there
trouble is i can't get them tight enough
to really give me what i feel is support so i'm i think probably just an ace bandage would work
but i want to get one of those padded ankle
what you call its
yeah it's going to cut off the circulation yeah i think i tried that one time a couple years ago and it did the same did that same thing
yeah i think i'll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something
well i guess that's about it for exercise
well that's good exercise and i don't do enough of that either
i sat down to a double dose of spaghetti tonight i
i like grilled cheese too
well you know i wonder though it's i think it really depends on the person
i was reading an article in the paper the other morning these doctors are baffled about this eighty seven year old man who eats thirty boiled eggs a day
did you see that
and they're wondering where does that cholesterol go
i think it is too and i and i think things like eggs and cheese anything like that i think it just depends on who you are
because i know people who eat tons of that kind of stuff and they're just as healthy as can be
i mean i'm sort of strange in a way i'm about twenty pounds overweight and i smoke but my blood pressure is about my last reading was just the other day it was one hundred two over seventy nine
yeah good and low
and i mean you'd think by looking at me my i'd have a bad heart and everything terrific heart great blood pressure
well good talking to you have yourself a good night
talk thank you talk to you later
what is it what does camping mean to you and
what camping have you done
hm
well what do you mean by environmental camping
oh
okay
but yeah that's neat i'm not
not had that available anywhere that i've lived at well first
what state is that
california okay i'm in texas and
but most of the camping that we've done we spent ten years in new england and my wife and i did a lot of tent camping before our first
boy was born there in state parks in new england and
here in texas there are state parks where they have
shelters they're called they're wood frame on a concrete slab but screened in
well that's the no the there's
one outlet and a light in the cabin an overhead one overhead bulb and then just outside the cabin there's a
faucet coming up out of the pipe coming up out of the ground so that there's access to water like that
well
no it's the ones that i'm familiar with are
basically wooded areas texas has an awful lot of man made lakes
and tend to be wooded areas around those lakes i'm in i'm in dallas northeast
three hours in any direction and it's still about the same so that's a difference but we also
well we didn't we took a break from camping for with the boys until they got into scouts basically and then our biggest one we rented a pop up tent trailer
several years ago and went up to the black hills and back down through the colorado rocky mountain national park and
colorado springs area and so forth pikes peak and that was a that was a lot of fun
yeah
oh okay
uh-huh yeah
yeah
yeah and
right at two she's old enough to walk but not too far i would guess and
and
although it after a while it gets with teenage boys at this point well one's in college but
it turns different in that the problem becomes one of getting time when they're available and don't have other activities
do you
uh-huh
yeah i don't watch i don't watch any tv really and i don't subscribe to the paper but a lot of the people who i work with do and
uh-huh
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess i get most of mine just from word of mouth just people chatting at work and stuff
um-hum
right
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right yeah the constitution is pretty bad too and they it just seems like they spend a lot too much time on trivialities and things you know they emphasize the wrong things especially in the campaign
huh-uh
uh-huh
um-hum
right
right
uh-huh
right
right
really
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
what
um-hum
oh that's nice
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
right
right
uh-huh
oh really
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
and i sell stanley products
and
so i don't really i don't really dress up a whole lot do you work outside
oh uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well you'd have to dress
differently when you're working every day i think yeah
uh-huh it's kind of a nice to relax a little bit yeah
yeah well my dress up i live out in the country also so what i wear depends on the weather
so i really i know a lot of the avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up but i mostly dress
i try to dress nice but for convenience because when the weather's bad when i go into the home i take off my shoes
i really don't have to dress up like you would like if you're in an office or something
yeah and the rest is gets into the cooler weather
uh-huh course they keep saying the weather's gonna change or we're gonna have more florida type weather up here so i don't know but for now
um-hum but even for now we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and cold weather and that type of thing now my daughter works all the time so she dresses
i think you know you have to spend more money on your clothing and that because you do have to have the appearance a good appearance to do a good job
where you work
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right yeah
did you find you wore slacks when you were working full time or did you did they wear more dresses and skirts
no slacks
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh not even a dressy slack a dressy suit slack suit even if it's all
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
hm
um-hum i know my daughter mostly i don't think she ever wears slacks to work but i didn't know the trend changes you know if
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah but yet you need to keep up an appearance for your husband too though at home but that's i believe
yeah but i look at homemaking as a job also being a homemaker and i think sometimes we lose sight of that
by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress
okay
uh-huh i've never seen that before
i have aerobics on monday nights too i just didn't quite make it tonight because i was caught up at work for too long but
but yeah i usually don't get home until eight o'clock so that's another good reason but
yeah i like cheers
uh-huh
back when i had time to watch tv oh maybe last year when i wasn't doing aerobics and work wasn't quite as busy as it's been lately i liked the wonders year's and
sometimes every now and then i'll catch doogie howser because i think that comes on at eight on wednesday nights and that's about the time i get home from aerobics and i turn on the tv as i sit down to eat dinner and i'll catch that
uh-huh
yeah
yeah it's kind of cute
yeah
yeah
i like what is it on oh i think coach is kind of funny on tuesday night
yeah i like that one
i haven't seen it in a while
um-hum
uh-huh
but that one's kind of cute i'm real bad i got hooked on a soap opera when i was in college general hospital
everybody in the dorm watched it i mean everybody you were an outcast if you didn't gather in the tv room at two o'clock in the afternoon to watch this soap i mean people scheduled their class around it and everything so i
i started watching it and to this day i still watch it i just kind of got caught in that and then after i moved out of the dorm
sorry mom
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh gosh
hum
yeah
course see four hours of soap operas is really going to translate into about two hours of tv watching time because they're really half of it is just commercials they play more commercials in soap operas than anything i've ever seen in my life but still i just don't think i could sit down for two hours
and especially two hours of soap operas i'd that'd be that might be a real good way just to break that habit is to have to watch them for that long i'd kind of be like
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah i think so i mean i guess that's the only one i've ever watched and i just i refused to i mean i never watched dallas or knots landing or any of those things because it's like
i don't want to get hooked into one of these things that you have to watch it every week
i mean you can watch coach from time to time and not have to you know not feel like oh wait i'm missing an episode and i won't know what's going on
and so that's fine and i like la law too that's another one
it is pretty good i've watched it maybe five or six times just that it comes on kind of late on thursday nights and sometimes i'm trying to get things done and get in bed so i can go to work of course for you it probably comes on really late on thursday night come to think of it
gosh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i haven't watched johnny carson in a long time i used to watch that and i used to watch david letterman and things like that in college and love connection that was one of my favorite ones in college because we'd get up in the in the apartment
and the guys from downstairs who by the way two of them were from san antonio there were three of us girls upstairs and three guys downstairs and they'd come upstairs and watch it with us and we'd all sit there and
you know we'd be yelling and going pick this one pick this one and we just had it was just a fun you know fun thing to watch but
kind of yeah but they have the three choices on video and it's usually real funny because they'll usually get someone in there that half the time the dates didn't work out at all and they have to tell about their date and how it went and
half the time they'll say well when he showed up at the door he didn't really look quite like his video and i just wasn't real sometimes they really burn each other it's really kind of funny but
and then you'll see the real funny looking couples and it's it was just entertaining and of course that was
that's been probably oh five six seven years ago since
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
sometimes i'll turn on cnn or something like that in the morning when i if i get really sick of the radio in the morning because they just they're so obnoxious
and so i'll turn on the tv and just i can hear it back in the bathroom and you know keep up kind of what's going on in the world so i'll do either cnn or good morning america or something like that but from time to time
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah i haven't watched it since the war started i cnn though was it was a life saver for me back in october
ti had sent me to taiwan actually they sent me to six foreign countries taiwan was right about in the middle and all they speak there is chinese and in my hotel room there was nothing but chinese programs on and they had cnn
and i just kept that thing on constantly because i was going english language this is wonderful and they at least i kind of knew what was going on the other side of the world and trying to keep up with
okay what's the weather been like and what's happening back in the us because by then i'd been out of the country for three weeks already and i was i was you know wondering what's been happening lately but
yeah believe it or not
yeah it was in english they had it in tokyo too in english but they had they had they had married with children have you ever seen that before
they had that on in tokyo i watched it one night i've seen it here before a few times it's a real sarcastic type show it's kind of funny
i thought i can't believe they're playing that in japan these people over there must think we are horrible i mean some of the american shows were some of the worst ones we have and that's what they're showing in tokyo and i'm thinking
i mean
yeah
yeah it was pretty embarrassing
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
all
yeah for the most part yeah i had a little sailboat
what part of texas you from
okay whereabouts is that
okay all right
is that right wow that's pretty
okay so you got some lakes around you can do that on so you do some skiing and stuff or
yeah all right
yeah all right
yeah that sounds good yeah we've part of the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now
yeah
not too many no but no i just got back from a weekend where we went and had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing it was pretty nice but
no i have i had a boat last summer that i took out a catamaran that i do did a lot of sailing on and stuff that's a lot of fun but my parents are pretty big sailors too they're kind of into it but
oh yeah i guess it's pretty fishing's a pretty big thing huh
yeah
yeah all right so where about in texas is that is that centrally located or
no what major city is nearby
okay and that's south or north of there or
yeah okay
oh okay all right well that sounds pretty good does i guess the weather does that stay pretty constant there or
yeah
yeah
oh that's great yeah i
oh that's fantastic yeah i used to kind of be that way myself when i lived in northwestern florida in the panhandle i used to sail about everyday i'd go to work
yeah it's a lot of fun it's especially if you get a pretty fast boat like those catamarans are pretty fast you can actually
yeah it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and the physics behind it
so it's not too bad it's pretty easy to get the hang of i think and generally everybody i've known has kind of gotten into it but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fun
yeah a lot of people don't see the excitement in sailing but then again they may ne'er they may never have tried anything like catamaran
and that's when you really start getting into speed you know you can actually some catamarans can actually pull people behind the skiers they get so fast you know
yeah they get pretty quick but
and he's pretty gassed about it he's got a good
well he he's from detroit so he usually goes on one of the great lakes i think and does his sailing for me i go back to orlando in about a month
and so down there basically just go to the coast we're about thirty miles from coco beach and the east coast and there's a lot of places there you can go you know
so that's a good thing
but yeah so what do you do for a job
oh really okay is that for ti or
okay
are they primarily electronic then
okay well that
right
oh okay
great yeah how do you like it down there in texas
yeah
oh no doubt okay i've never been to texas i've been to oklahoma but that's about as far
yeah okay well that's good because i didn't like oklahoma that well
so let me tell you a little bit about the weather here last sunday night we had an ice storm
which took down all of our trees all the power lines all the phone lines
it was it was incredible it occurred about two thirty at night
or in the morning actually for the past six days we've been out heat without power
without a phone we've basically been living out of suitcases at friend's house that happened to have power it's really been horrible
we're we live in rochester new york
so i mean normally you know this time of year it's very cold and we have a lot of snow and all that and this has just been something we've never seen an ice storm like this before
and people that actually were staying home
without any heat they were estimating it was getting down to about thirty degrees inside the house without any heat
it's really been crazy
are you serious
do are you someone that likes the heat
um-hum
um-hum
what is it normally like there this time of year
so would it
today it's sixty five
oh that's great you must be feeling like it's
oh that's so nice
um-hum
yeah compared to what we're having
yeah
so what's the lowest that the temperature would ever get there
um-hum
they did oh wow
this past thursday we had winds and snow to the point where if you walked outside and if you're walking against the wind
you almost couldn't move because the wind wouldn't let you walk it was so strong it was really
well on monday all the businesses were closed
and then on tuesday i would say about half of the businesses were closed
trees through their cars you know trees had fallen right on top of their cars
other people had trees go right through there rooftops
it's just as a matter of fact governor cuomo the governor of new york
is supposedly asking bush now to declare rochester a disasters area
and obviously to get some funding to help clean up this mess
but it's really you know besides just the inconvenience of it all it's pretty sad because
rochester had some nice parks and some really beautiful tree lined streets and they're all just destroyed
they were all torn down the ice it was really just a crippling
thing for the whole city
i can imagine there be
yeah
really
oh that's funny
um-hum
oh jeez
yeah
well i grew up in boston and in boston we get our share of snow but it was always very well cleaned up
they would be the plows would be on the streets and they would salt and sand and you know it would then the next morning it would be fine
and in rochester they i guess they feel that they get so much snow that they don't clean it up for just a little bit
so even for three or four inches you're just driving right on it the streets haven't been plowed
there's no salt on the ground nothing they wait -til they get a major storm
oh really
um-hum
oh
really
oh my gosh
um-hum
that's crazy
sure
oh i'm
i thought you were saying can you hold on oh okay
well i just came back from getting our new clothes for today and we'll try we stayed all last week with one set of friends and
they were having company this weekend so we had to move and you just feel like you're imposing on people you know
oh no they're averaging well there estimating that next by next thursday
everybody should have there power back
the schools were all closed this week and they're still thinking of closing them on monday because
for little kids it's still kind of dangerous on to be on the sidewalks because there might be some live wires hanging down and
and there're a lot of streets that are just closed
because you just can't drive on them and there's too many trees and that sort of thing
but one thing that was very funny is on monday almost every single store in rochester had been sold out of batteries
because people are needing batteries for portable radios and flashlights and
really and we had you know a refrigerator full of food and a freezer full of food
and that's all been just you know it's you can't use it it's just gone bad
so this storm really it's been incredible
right exactly as a matter of fact we made on to i don't know if you ever watch dan rather
the cbs news
he mentioned i guess it was monday night or tuesday night he mentioned the state of emergency
i don't know i would much rather be in the warm of sun
um-hum
well throughout all of this i called my in-laws who live in florida
and they just finished putting in a pool
so while i was sitting freezing in a pay phone outside of our house
they were sitting by the pool sipping you know a glass of wine and
oh it was really it was horrible
but
it really is
oh you do oh
i remember the earthquake last year and i you know i guess you didn't you like the earthquake over in san francisco remember that and
you know you can hear about it on tv and you just think so
yeah exactly and you just never think it could happen to you
but
um-hum
yeah that's true
well western new york is suppose to be use to this kind of weather but
right now people the crews that are
no it's true
but there are some people that just love it i mean there are people that even if it gets to
sixty degrees they feel that's too hot
and they just they enjoy the snow and they enjoy the cold and that's why they live here i guess but
you for the month between basically november and april
if you don't like the snow and the cold then you might as well just pack your bags and leave
because that's all that's all there is here
oh yeah
um-hum
that is great what do you plant this time of year
and what
okay go ahead
yeah
well i tell you i firmly believe in exercising i think it's a i do it everyday on a regular basis i
well i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles but this time of year you can't get much biking in
but every morning i use this president's council of physical fitness and it really is
it's worth doing and you can do it anywhere i travel quite a bit in my in my business and you can do it
you know wherever you're at and if you do it i do it every morning after usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get you know dressed going you know to go to work
every you know it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because i do it all the time but i do twenty five
what where you have your arms above your head and your body twisters touch you know left and right toe
then i do ten right and left trunk twisters
and i do about sixty
you know bicycle type leg thrust type things
and i do twenty leg lifters on each side you know when you're laying on the floor
and then i do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups and then i do about
oh yeah oh yeah and then thirty now if you did football like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you know prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing
but that takes about really about maybe about thirteen minutes you know in the morning to do it but
well
years ago i used to referee football and to stay in condition i did that just as a normal basis and
i tell you just by doing it well
example this summer i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be so i increased
i do three hundred sit ups a day now but not at that in the morning i do a hundred then and then i do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before i go to bed i lost fifteen pounds
just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles and you can you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want but you don't you know within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being and
i just you know you're ready to go at a i think it's really important
yeah
well that's why chuck i think if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like
well i like biking and during summer i'll do you know at least seventy five miles a week and when i really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty but you can't
you know there's excuses the weather or you don't have time or something like that
but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're gonna spend fifteen minutes or a half hour and you get up a half hour earlier
and once you start getting into that one you just feel good and you look a whole lot better
i sure wish she would she's you know unfortunately overweight and but she's a wonderful woman and you know no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it
no problem at all and if you get one of these mats you know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these abcs of physical fitness on them
one of my kids got me one of those for christmas one year and
it it's just an exercise mat that rolls up so you can put it out you know just in the corner
well yeah you can do that
but it doesn't
yeah it's a foam thing yeah and it's just about six feet long it rolls up
and i don't take it on trips with me i you could but i don't mind you know if i do like sit ups i'll throw a
a towel down or something and you know so you don't have the abrasive
do you consider your company's benefits to be reasonably good
okay yeah i work at texas instruments also
yeah well i'll have to agree with that if you if your benefits plan isn't as good you're going to drive people away but it seems they're making an effort to be better each year
no that's true
yeah well it's necessary to be competitive when i started work the they didn't have a dental plan
and so you're on our own but that's improved immensely it still may not be competitive with other companies of our size but it's better than nothing right now
it's got limitations
right
right well i think other improvements could be made say in the medical plan as well we really don't we really don't do a great deal for preventive care they don't offer say physicals every few years
something like that if they could cover that it would be most beneficial i think
right
well you see something
right
well you'll see plans every now and then through texins organization where they've got the type of screening you're talking about other types of preventive care but as far as it being a regular part of the benefits plan i haven't seen that yet
right now in particular
getting away from medical benefits one of the best things i see is the coda plan
where there's a matched savings contribution
well there's no catch the you contribute
a fixed percent or as much as i guess up to fifteen percent of your salary and ti will match that up to two percent
right
yeah
oh sure well it's meant to be a long term savings plan like an ira
you get the benefit that the money comes out of pre tax dollars they aren't taxing it right away and it's all tax deferred as well
sure i'd like to see something like a cafeteria plan where you only have to pay for the benefits that you use yourself
instead of having to pay for benefits that other people use it gets subsidized by everybody's contribution
i didn't think about that you're right that's true
sure
i just wonder how they would enforce something like that with the smoker policy
yeah
well i sure made sure that i got that form filled out as soon as possible and turned in
people who neglect to do that are going to pay for it
sure
sure
i've heard that the smoking cessation plans are very good here
that's very good i understand that when they first developed the nonsmoking policy the clean air policy as they call it that over two thousand people signed up for the smoking cessation classes the first year
right
uh-huh
are there any benefits that you're still dissatisfied with that could use more improvement
about nineteen seventy two i started in seventy eight
no
sure
and profit sharing is something we don't have a lot of control over
but it seems that the company is going out of their way to not give us profit sharing
we keep spending more money on property and facilities
that's right i think in my thirteen years i've had four years of profit sharing
right
well i think that's the right attitude for a company like this to have in order to survive but a lot of people aren't getting the message and they don't have any type of savings plan established
well
yeah i'll tell you i was i was thinking about it while i was waiting for a connection
perhaps a little bit cumbersome at the same time i don't know it's one of the oddities one of the few things that are left you know is as the world shrinks we become more and more homogenized everybody
and the whole i don't know
yeah but i don't know i kind of got a soft spot in my heart for feet and inches even though i like i say in my business i do have to work around it
yeah
you know i think one of one of the reasons that i've got some hesitancy about doing it is that i still have a difficult time
okay but as far as you know and it's i've kind of got the conversion of different parts of the metric system where i'm comfortable with it but i'm not with weights
and until i guess it would be something that if i had been a little more educated in it or forced into using it more i might be more comfortable with it
uh-huh
well sure it'd take a new it would take a new generation to be just you know completely metric
yeah i think you're right
yeah
why the first attempt failed you know and i was i don't know i don't really have a good answer for that other than i guess it was just that much resistance to change
that's true and the other thing too they're they were going to use both systems you know simultaneously
right
sure
yeah and then and then you could you know people would start seeing a you know a quantity and they would say well hey that you know that's that looks to be about two pounds and hey that's this much you know in metric so you know
um-hum
yeah
yeah although there are
well toby have you ever served on a jury in a criminal trial
well we had a hung jury so i came away really disappointed in the process or the least the people involved i was very frustrated about that
i think it was something like oh ten to three ten to two or nine to three or something like that
which really means that if we hadn't of had to have unanimous decision
we would
would have completed our mission if you will
i think it was ten people
no it's the funny
yeah
well the crazy thing about this trial was that the guy said yes i did this i did this armed robbery but he wanted a jury to decide his sentence
and we couldn't even agree on a sentence
i mean i was ready to put the guy away forever but i was dealing with people who said well if it were my son i'd want him to have another chance
oh is that right otherwise the judge does it
do you think that's appropriate or should it be changed
yeah
well and i do not know if it is this way it all states or not but in texas there are severe limitations on what the jury can know about the prior history of the alleged criminal
and also what they can be told about the effects of sentencing like if you give somebody fifteen years they'll be out in three weeks or something like that
i maybe it's not quite that radical but those things are not those are things are kept from the jury
uh-huh
huh
well i did have you ever heard of a man named milton friedman
yeah well no he actually wasn't he he's an he was
but he wrote several books years ago and he put out like ten different movies on government and
and i'm a kind of a milton friedman fan and he's anti big government and that's my feeling about it i think our government is way too big
that there's just a tremendous amount of waste i'm a cpa and i see the way they butcher people as far as i'm concerned and
in the in the tax end of it as far as how they
take money from them
tax laws in new legislation right now are really a critical big issue
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
uh-huh
right
the deficit the country's in right now is just incredible i heard a statistic the other day i don't know if this is wrong or right
but for every man woman and child in the united states they're in debt about forty thousand dollars a piece
i have a family of five if i had if i had to pay that much responsible for that much debt
i'd be done i'd be sunk
you know i just i there's no way i can generate the income to service that kind of debt
i don't know what the heck our government's going to do one time i really personally think we're going to have to collapse just like the soviet union did
or i don't know how can we
yeah right i don't see it in the near future but
yeah because we write off debts we loaned the mexican government five hundred million dollars or whatever and forgave them
that's the same thing with what happened over there in i and i believe it was turkey we wanted to use their air strips during the persian gulf
so we just went over there and said gee guys you owe us all this money well i tell you let us land our planes here and we'll just forgive it
that's ridiculous
and i don't know if that's really the case you know i'm talking all out of hearsay and conversation from what i've heard from other from other some of my other associates but that wouldn't surprise me
and i'm not so sure they're all that wrong
uh-huh
right
yes i have a daughter yeah she's only about a little less than two years old
no
yeah
no decision
that
they well help them make in terms of you know what they're wanting to do you know that that's a big influence i think and you know what not only what you can afford but what
what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are
so
you know you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do
university of mississippi
well it was
well it was in within the state
but it wasn't necessarily local it was
what's the criterion for choosing to go there
well at the time i was thinking of going premed and in the state they had the best premed curriculum for the
state institutions it was a choice between there and a private college that was a bit more expensive at the time we really could not afford it so
i ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me it i enjoyed it
no
no it was a six hour drive
well
i was
it was like another world
basically it was a no it was a
did not get home that often you know and at that age it's kind of
kind of difficult sometimes too
especially if you have not been away a lot
that extended
yeah
uh-huh
that's true
yeah that that's like you know when i went on to get my masters i
basically
was you know it was where i was at the time you know i wasn't gonna
try to pick and go somewhere else because i was i was pretty much settled and i was trying to work and
but so when you are first going to school that you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go
the computer science center
north building
um-hum
about three years
yeah i have
no actually i mean i came straight from school to here so
so cause this was the first real job after getting my degree
so i made
career change basically
yeah
well i mean i would like to you know the i like the school where i went i mean and i would not
hesitate at all to encourage her to go there if she wanted to or the school where i got my masters at which was a different school and
tuition break for out of state students who are
children of alumnae
oh alumnae recruiting here in town recently well last year and it was kind of fun because you are trying to
to trying to get people interested in your school you know and they were they this was a college night at a at a high school in richardson and it was and there were a bunch of
to talk up you know your school and i was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of you know our school and were interested in it and
you know we you situations like that you don't realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others you
and so i was real pleased with that worked out so well
i think so i don't know offhand but it seemed like there were quite a few
kids that were definitely interested in going there
so there was one mother who came by right even before we started who obviously was very interested in getting her daughter in or
how good her daughter was and she had cards printed up actually describing you know business cards describing her daughter's you know she had won several different twirling awards and all this and she was
yes
well
basically i think it would be a good idea myself
i
i think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it i do think that there has to be some controls like i don't think one test positive should
be
the end of it you know i think they should test more than once
it
um-hum
that's right
um-hum there's so many jobs that really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life and you know and it's
how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it
you know and i just
i think there definitely needs to be some control to it i guess it is possible to have a false
positive report
um-hum
um-hum
or somebody's test get mixed up with somebody else's i mean those things do happen
i certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined wrongly
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that doesn't require the testing
to me
it's to me it's not an invasion of privacy i think it's people have a right to know if their life maybe is in jeopardy or
yeah their work the work they're doing for their company
those things are all affected if not immediately it certainly does eventually
i think that's where a lot of the problem is at first it doesn't seem to
bother the quality of work
but eventually it does
um-hum
um-hum
course i feel the same way on the aids problem
i don't think that's an invasion of privacy that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for
you know and it's destroying a lot of people's lives
yeah and it's you know it's destroying people's lives and i think
that person plus anybody in danger should know about it and be aware of it
so i don't know it's kind of hard to
i guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that an invasion of privacy of course that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today i guess so
oh that's probably way my brother did live in grapevine texas that's near dallas
uh-huh
uh-huh
it's pretty hot down there probably
oh did you really oh that's great
uh-huh we need rain real bad up here it's everything's really getting dry it's
yeah it's kind of at a dangerous level here people hauling water and it's getting real bad
so
i can't think of anything else
uh-huh
uh-huh i can understand i know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them
i can see them objecting
you know there's a lot of people that think there's nothing wrong with
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
is that right
oh i'll be darn
yeah the different cultures and that too
no i'm sure it would have to affect you the same way
i can't think that would make any difference whether it was legal or not it would have to affect you the same way
um-hum
oh yeah you can't you go by their laws
because they have to follow their rules and some of the countries are very much against drugs and
yeah a lot of them yeah where is it they lose a
yeah
yeah so i guess you know we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how great our country is
um-hum
um-hum
they abuse it is what they do yeah
so
it's okay you can get started there
oh that's probably what i was going to say
okay
oh uh-huh
oh yeah where are you calling from
dallas yeah i'm from rowlett
oh really
really i was going to ask you if you've been out to southfork
uh-huh
huh
okay
i can't say i'm that much of a faithful dallas follower maybe it's because i live here and i know how hokey it is i don't know
one of my
i went to school out in plano and one of my classmates married one of the
one of the duncans that actually owned southfork when it started
so
and i think she was in some of the shows for a while as extra and stuff so
yeah
well what are you going to do they're coming to the end of their season
i was going to say there's going to be no more dallas reruns
yeah it's got to come back
uh-huh
so you didn't need to know the language
how about that
true and hear the weird voices
yeah somebody one time was talking about john wayne movies with these weird japanese voices and
it's hard to imagine
well what do you think about what's going on la law this year it's
have you seen it the past couple of weeks
yeah and she's pregnant did you know that
and that they kicked michael kuzak out
did you know that
no he the i'm trying to remember leland decided to extend brackman's
reign as a senior partner
and the rest of the partners all got up in arms about it
and michael met with them and said and said you know we got to do something about this we need to make a proposal let somebody else be the leader and he kind of elected himself
and everybody else went along with it and they gave it to leland and he hit the roof
and
he and brackman talked about it and brackman decided to try and do away with him so he fired him
because he violated one of their policies of going behind a senior partner's back or something
so they fired him they chased him off with the security guards
they're fighting out that battle now he's firm formed his own firm
he
what else did he do he did a lot of nasty stuff behind their back
yeah he stole grace and victor they've gone with him
and
who are the other two he stole two associates
abby and jonathan he took abby and jonathan with him
yeah and he went to he went to the bank
and he took i can't remember the guy the guy he defended for murder
earl you know they had a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills
do you remember that
yeah
uh-huh
they put a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills because it was like three or four hundred thousand dollars or something
well michael reduced his legal fees to twenty thousand dollars
so that they cut that out so they couldn't have a lien on his house anymore
so he did away with that and then he went to the bank because the bank gave him apparently some extra credit because they had that lien
well since they didn't have the lien anymore they couldn't have the credit from the bank so that got the firm in hot water
and then michael went to court and petitioned that they needed to go into solvency
because they were so financially in bad shape
and they all showed up in court leland was going to try a motion make a motion before that so they ended up both being in court in front of the judge pleading their case and
i think i think michael was doing it on the one hand and the guy that do you remember the guy that grace had an affair with the other lawyer that she had an affair with for a while kind of an older guy
no he wasn't at the firm he was like rosalyn chase's lawyer before
it was earlier in the season she had an affair with this other lawyer
and anyway leland apparently has hired him on now and he's and he's defending this case
and what happened at the end is the judge
michael wanted the firm put in receivership
and the judge wouldn't do it but he said he he's going to give a like a ten day evaluation
and he was going to put it in the hands of a businessman to run it and see if the firm was salvageable or not
and both parties had to come up with lists of people that were suitable to run it
you'll never guess who this person is
uh-huh
in the past two years
besides rosalyn she's dead and gone
goofy
you'll never get it it's
was it roxanne
roxanne's ex-husband
david meyer
yeah i know that's who he put in charge of the firm you
yeah that's pretty strange well they they've already said that
who is it i guess it's susan dey and
whoever plays kuzak isn't coming back next year so some of this some of this has to do with why they're not coming back i guess
yeah
they're going to stay there in fact
susan dey and
the wife had a confrontation about it
why they didn't invite them
and the firm that kuzak founded is just a litigation firm
and they said well we wanted we wanted you but we didn't really want stuart
because he's not a litigationist and we didn't figure you would come without him and we're going to be fighting against each other so
so it's just kind of weird
yeah
i know
uh-huh
that was kind of bizarre
yeah it's interesting to talk about their marriage in real life because she had breast cancer and that
yeah and that was real tough for him and there were some times on the show where there were some real emotional things going on with
okay
well yeah i like to do a little remodeling work and in older homes and stuff i just bought a home two years ago that's about sixty five years old and we've done a little work on it
and about
pardon me
timber framing okay well
other than you talking about like post and beam construction that type well not very much other than what i read we don't use much of that up here although i understand they do in the southwest quite a bit
but
up here we generally use frame construction work or wood frame construction with wooden siding and you know most of your homes down south i guess are brick
but here they're pretty much wood frame construction on a two by four's and one by twelve boarding on the outside or sheet plywood
and then some kind of a insulation material and covered with clapboards or shingles
that's a typical new england home i guess
ah
sure
um-hum
oh okay that's unique we do a lot of truss roofs up here but they are they're again they're
they're truss construction but they're well braced you know cross braced inside held together by steel cleats and stuff
mansard roofs are in bond building i guess are
they do a lot of that
i understand by laminating the series of beams of planks together and with
um-hum
well that's something
sure something like the way you'd do bricks around a window around a large window type thing the center the center brick is the key brick which locks everything together that's a pretty neat idea
uh-huh
okay
where are you located
okay
yeah okay i lived in abilene for about ten years
i worked for the ti plant in abilene and i sure enjoyed the southwest it was really neat
but that that's an interesting concept that is this going to be your permanent home or okay
i saw a log cabin built down there that i was really impressed with and it sounds like it's similar to the open construction that you're going to have where the only thing enclosed upstairs were the bedrooms
but the rest of the center portion of the cabin which was a huge house was all open and the thing i really liked about it was it had a porch on all four sides of the house
all the way around the house
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
wow boy that's quite a distance
yeah i have a pretty good idea where it is of course i know wichita falls pretty well
pardon me
yeah
uh-huh well that's really interesting
yeah well out that way it shouldn't be to bad i guess your traffic doesn't get too heavy till you head in toward dallas a little bit but you should spread out pretty good out there i know
yeah out in west texas there was hardly any at all in abilene but
oh
oh okay yeah well i live about i live just over the line of south of attleboro massachusetts into rhode island
and it's just north of the city of providence
but it moves pretty well so
well boy it's sure been nice talking with you and hopefully we'll have another conversation probably another way down the road good luck with your new home
is that right
sure
uh-huh
you going to take advantage of the ground thermal action and use that for your heat and cooling
for cooling especially yeah well your winters get a little cold down there sometimes but
yeah well it's been cold up here the mornings have been cold the winds blowing about forty miles an hour right now so it's really cold outside
we've been real fortunate we haven't had much snow and stuff so
is that right
yeah that's but that's a little too much though then a lot of folks catch colds and stuff that you know
the temperature change is too drastic like that it should come a little more gradual i think
okay sir
it yeah thank you much i will talk to you again bye-bye
oh
i have a cat and a dog both
yeah
yeah
no i
i have a house that has a fairly good sized yard and
by at night by myself because my husband works at night and
so i wanted a dog for protection and
and we got a dalmatian
yeah and
he's wonderful because
he's really protective
and that was probably our main reason for getting him but
oh he loves the cat the
sam our dalmatian loves the cat but the cat just really doesn't care about the dog at all
you know he'll slap at him and
hiss at him and everything and the cat stays in
that's a you know barrier there but yeah
friendship yeah
yeah oh sam is very loving if
if one of us are out in the yard you know he wants to jump and play and lick a
typical puppy type atmosphere although he's
almost two years old but
yeah the cat is a lot of companionship
he just he's real old and he kind of lays around just wants you pet him and that kind of thing
no not at all not at all
and that's kind of weird we haven't figured that out yet
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i've never had any the ones that you just mentioned i have had a rabbit
it was pretty interesting and it was like a cat it stayed in the house all the time and it used a litter box
so it had free run of the house
not to strangers not strangers at all matter of fact it would run and hide but after it got to know you it was funny because it would jump up on the couch and sit right next to you know and it kind of pants
and it's kind of funny because you can just sit there and pet them and
my rabbit got real large i think he was thirteen pounds
but he was a good guard
yeah at he heard every little noise and you could tell when a car drove up or anything
oh no
no i don't think so
no nothing like that
okay thanks bye-bye
i buy workout clothes i'm into fitness a lot and so i spend money on that gets kind of expensive
uh-huh
really
uh-huh
oh did she rose oh that's
on my goodness well do are you into working out or anything
oh
right well what kind of clothes do you wear to work or to school
um-hum
is the weather pretty cold
well i found out what a difference it makes i just had regular walking shoes that i was running in
and it didn't give me the support i needed i had too much shock and too much jolting on my knees and my ankles and my joints and my lower back
oh well down the sidewalks and on the side on the grass the side roads
but i was running on the track and it's just carpet with a little thin thing of padding and then concrete and in those tennis shoes i had reebok's on
yeah reebok walking shoes and they just did not do the job at all
so about a week after i started running my shin started hurting i got shin splints
so i went to the athlete a shoe store here in tyler
and tried on several different pairs of shoes i tried asics and nike air and new balance and some different type of tennis shoes that are running
and finally got some nike air because they have the air pockets in the front and the back
and i didn't think that it would make any difference you know i thought well that's just a sales pitch you know and nike's real expensive because they're always putting out new things and you just pay for the brand
but i tried on i compared the way that felt to all the other brands and the prices difference wasn't that much you know maybe ten dollars difference
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh well that's good
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
does this give us the signal i guess not okay
we have family reunions about every year with my husband's family
and generally it's held in the summer and we have it in the state park which has worked out pretty well over by clifton forge
delford have you ever heard of that
right uh-huh
try to find a time when everybody can be there and we've
been pretty lucky so far
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
where in new hampshire
oh uh-huh
well
well we're some of the older ones in the family so the ones with small kids usually have ball games and kick ball things like that
one of them has made big banners to put on the
oh we have one of those isn't that awful
shelter a covered shelter and they've had big banners to display across the front of that
and it's always a potluck everybody brings food
ah
get all those good family favorites
oh i see
oh that's great
oh yeah that's great what time of year do you
you have it in the fall like after yeah at football games it is it's wonderful my next family reunion with my family will be
a wedding in atlanta this month so we're looking forward to that
golly so that's pretty good
yeah
uh-huh do they do you organize things or get or do they just
right
a lot of things to do huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
always bring one huh yeah
oh uh-huh
yeah that's interesting because that's a good idea
yeah
uh-huh is her family in texas
uh-huh
yeah right well i have two girls and one is in texas and she's a ti employee right now and the other one is in new mexico
right
uh-huh colorado is beautiful
uh-huh
right
yeah
oh great
uh-huh
oh
that makes it great doesn't it
uh-huh
right well we go to maine every fall i have a brother who lives there still and i have a sister-in-law and nieces and nephews so we always have a family reunion up in farmington
no i haven't huh-uh
oh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
that's pretty interesting
yeah
right uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
but
yeah i would think that sentencing would be the kind of thing that an expert system would be ideal for you know there's a whole bunch of evidence that's supposed to be weighed and for nice uniform sentencing for particular things
it would seem like the perfect solution but i suppose that would be really subject to abuse as well
yeah there's so much variation in sentencing like this guy recently that
there was some guy that was convicted and he volunteered to be castrated i guess that was down in your area
and then here they've gone and no surgeon could be found to perform the job so the judge went and withdrew the whole idea or something like that
yeah one thing i would certainly like to see is that criminals be sentenced to some sort of a means of paying for their incarceration
i think that's reasonable those of us on this side of the justice system have to pay our way through life
yeah absolutely
really
yeah i would think there's a lot that a lot of production that could be done
you know with people like that whether totally unskilled or not
that's a tough one
agree on anything or it's hard to get everybody to agree on something i can't there's some saying i can't remember what it is
yeah really that's a really good point
how is it now do you know do they have it so that if some certain percentage agrees then or
hum
more time and expense
very interesting
yeah there seems to be a lot of problems with the criminal justice system in america today i'm certainly no one to have the answers
hum
unbelievably i
yeah and they're all automatic too for a long ways at least
yes i used to work with a guy from puerto rico when i worked for hewlett packard
and he had some interesting times getting used to it
the united states the language was a little bit different although he did speak english
i've never been there my dad used to work for dupont and they built a chemical plant down there i almost moved there when i was in high school
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
my dad flew down there for about a year he was down there about once a month one week per month
and
i wanted to move there it sounded like a neat place to live an island in the sun you know and
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah i lived in colorado for a while and people kept saying the same thing to me oh it must have been great
i go oh it was just a place to live
yeah i was
i think the status quo seems to be working i don't think from talking to jerry my friend that lived there that they don't seem upset about it or anything and
i think it would upset more people if they tried to change it
yeah
i don't know fifty one stars on this flag wouldn't look too good
yeah if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty two might be able to be arranged better i don't know
yeah i don't know cut california in half or something
but i know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because they'll build plants down there because they don't have to pay taxes on the stuff
and they make i guess it's no income tax there or no federal income tax something like that
yeah
yeah i think it's a territory
that makes sense
i mean there's lots of tiny islands in the south pacific that are territories like that they could make states like guam
or
yeah it's a u s territory and it's just we own it or
yeah
well hawaii is pretty far too think about it
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah where as puerto rico is pretty close by
which
i don't know
no i don't think they would
yeah
but actually i knew another guy from puerto rico that i went to school with
and he was coming he came to america to go to school
and i think he was going to go back be an engineer out there
both of the ones i met have been really funny guys i don't know if that's
if that's true about all puerto ricans or not
ones i met have been pretty funny
but let them decide
yeah
yeah
i think that makes the most sense
hum
okay we have we been on for a long enough time
okay yeah this is this is actually the first time i've had someone call me so
but
it went fine
all right well it was good talking to you becky bye-bye
we have different communities
uh-huh
i think it's true yeah and there are some areas where i believe they limit it they want you to just strictly go with the cans because of the different content but i think you're right the more often you can
um-hum
we just started it this year and it's really nice to be able to have that convenience as opposed to having to go to a local
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
right it seems like it would be better all the way around if there were more curbside recycling
the one thing that they don't pick up they actually don't care if we mix together the aluminum and the bottles we put those all in one big bag and then put the paper goods separately but the one thing they don't pick up are the plastic goods you know
those big milk tubs and that constitutes a big portion of our trash so i would hope at some point those things would either
stop being manufactured or that they would be able to figure out a way to recycle those economically
right yes
they say on the cans or on the not the cans but the containers in fact that they are recyclable but i've i'm the same with you i haven't been able to at least not convenience probably outside the city limits or something
um-hum
yeah well the fact that you're doing it at school with the with the kids is a great idea too because then they're also encouraged to learn about how to do that
oh uh-huh
i like that yes uh-huh
um-hum the children
oh is that the kids that you teach
uh-huh
um-hum
that's great
um-hum and i think when the government the local or the state government attends to support it the more happens i know that in our i work in a hospital i'm a therapist and
just about three years ago when we started recycling everything
they not only recognized that they could save money with all
okay amy what do you think about taking care of the elderly
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
what is the point at which you would go from home care to institutional care
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
what would you what would you look for in an institution
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right
yeah
uh-huh
right
would you consider a transitional institution such as one that allows the resident sort of like an apartment complex for elderly people
uh-huh
yeah
that's you know i hope if my mother ever gets
to the point where she can't take care of the home herself that she would consider the apartment type
setting you know from what i've seen with my grandmother who passed away i don't know maybe ten or twelve years ago they had her in a setting like that where she was responsible to
go to they had dinner in the cafeteria and she had her own little room it wasn't like she didn't have a stove or anything in her own apartment
yeah but you know she could walk to walk to the dinner hall and had games and stuff so it was sort of like a step between a
nursing home and a you know just a retirement village or whatever they're called those so i guess there's different levels you just have to be sure and match your loved one with that
uh-huh
yeah it's she'll become
you know a bigger issue as you know the medical profession continues to you know increase longevity
we're going to see you know geriatrics will be a big part of the profession i think
so
it's a lot to consider
yeah i guess i'm a big advocate of
decreased morbidity which is where the elderly person through i don't know a healthier lifestyle and exercise and eating right can
you know sustain themselves for longer periods of time
right
yeah hopefully yeah the insurance companies will see the advantage of signing up a sixty year old for a you know exercise class or something like that
well it's been fun talking with you
all right bye
uh-huh
andrews
well for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
september's really was i'm not sure about october i think for about twelve months through september the average temperature had been higher than normal each month
lots of ninety degree days during the summer
good
yep
oh if you had it early
yeah i think we usually have a frost in october
but you know we really need the rain that we've been getting and it has not today but the last few days it's been pouring most of the day
yes
yeah we had we had summer lasting long and then it then it then it became winter like
today it's today it's sort of change it's warmer to sort of more typical autumn day
hm
guess not
i don't know yeah our leaves are all on the on the ground now i think it was a especially good winter for fall colors
the oh yeah oh yeah we did for a time
um-hum
um-hum but not this year for the trees for the leaves
hm
yeah this is because it can't tolerate a freeze this early is that right
if it would came later it'd be all right
hm
oh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
right
i'm a co-op student at gtri
i go to school at georgia tech and we don't have benefits to speak of we don't have health insurance or paid vacation and
um-hum
undergrad
um-hum
oh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
well that's a good idea i had never thought about it that way
um-hum
yeah
right
right that's
that would be a wonderful idea
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
i didn't know that
really
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
wow
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
wow
yipes
um-hum
right
oh i'm just not entirely sure i have only been working here for one quarter this is my first quarter here and i'm not really all too sure what kind of jobs are available and
i haven't gotten them yet i'm going in a few
and i
i'm going to be doing research for a professor next quarter and see how i like that see
if research for a school would be something i would consider
oh it's the georgia tech research institute it's affiliated with the university
and we do research the one i'm in the lab i'm in does research in microwaves and antennas
and we do a lot of research for the federal government
so a lot of our expenses are you know covered by the federal government
so
hi
yeah
actually i didn't either i really wasn't familiar with that and i didn't even realize i had put that as you know this must be something
yes
oh god close johnstown
oh your kidding
oh isn't that only people from there can tell everyone else is where did you get that weird accent
no right now i'm in washington dc area
and you're in dallas
okay
oh okay well my yeah actually my husband he's with the he's with the federal government and i'm a civil engineer but i'm taking a year off
i've never heard of such of thing this is this is really a surprise to me i wasn't total i'm glad it was you because i was afraid i'd get some guy on here that knows all about this
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
and how do how do you think that they would propose to do is far as if a person is coming out of high school and going to college how could you know i wonder how they could possibly
if this would be a voluntary thing or a mandatory
yes it did yeah
well i think i would also and i think it really would be very difficult in terms of you know people i'm thinking mainly people going to college i don't see how
how with the work load kids have nowadays and what often most college students i'm like maybe when we went to school i don't know how long ago you went but
oh really
yeah
i see
yeah
yeah the other thing i think that they could do possibly is with
i don't know when i went to school we had in our social studies we had it divided into for every report card period like there were five or six week sessions and we could pick what we wanted
to take you know whether you wanted to study american indians or this or that maybe as one of those six week sessions instead of having a class or have the class but as part of that or part of the credit would be to do something like that on a voluntary basis
yeah i really i'm bewildered as far as how they could even work something like this in if they try to make it mandatory
right
right and in this area there's so much going on volunteer wise like for home life i you know i know it's for
yeah there are many organizations feed the hungry all these there's a lot of drives in school for this type of thing already you know not sometimes
they might even have i know with a niece and nephew of mine they're school was like church school and they even had things where they would have them go to shelters downtown and help for a day
or what a lot of kids do here is they have things to school where they have actual they have a holiday game night but every your fee if you want to call it or the way you get admitted to going to this show is to
bring a can or two for the hungry
uh-huh
yeah that is this yeah that is pretty wild that is pretty wild yeah
right or yeah i think they can integrate maybe a short period of time
in with high school students and get them to be aware that you know they're not especially teenagers they're not the only ones around and what maybe their
you know their parents are going through i know in an area like this it's fairly affluent and kids here are really out of touch with reality i always call it disneyland here
and you know you see sixteen year olds driving around in brand new bmws and it's just unbelievable you know
right
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
yeah
yeah
no they don't
right and i think one other area here is that this is typically what we call in this area yuppie area and people aren't my kids you know other than you know occasionally they're not even aware that there are people over fifty that
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right and i in general i feel that i don't know what this still proposes far as what age or how they would do this but i feel that reaching
the kids when they're younger is better though i think once they're out of high school they're so into their own thing that i think it would be very difficult maybe by that
time they're too calloused to what is even going on you know where as younger children it's the it's the grade school children when there say no to drugs and that type of thing in school
they're the ones that'll come home and tell you know you shouldn't smoke it's bad for you shouldn't drink it's bad for you
and i think it's the younger it's the younger kids that it reaches more and so if they want to start this type of thing it should be integrated maybe from a young age and
yes
right
yeah i think so
yeah you yeah i don't know if you miss it or not but
uh-huh
yeah well this is a good area because you're far enough away and yet you're close you know so holidays and things or whatever you wanted to you can be there but
you know i enjoy being here i don't know if i'd ever you know i might go back there eventually one day it's a depressed area right now you know
oh yeah oh pittsburgh i lived there four years i liked when i was a teenager and early twenties and i liked it there a lot people didn't but i really enjoyed it
okay maureen could you tell me what type of dining out that you like to do
is that that's because you're natives there and that's what you're used to you you've grown up that way
yeah right
yeah we've got a place down at providence that's
that's called federal hill and
it's all the old italians
and
they've got some real nice restaurants down there but what
we usually like to do is go out and
and have something that we normally don't have at home
like you can have naturally we've got a lot of fish up here you know and shellfish and because we live right on the coast
but that's readily available and we can usually have that at home or we usually throw a steak on our on the grill or something
but when we go out to eat we like to go to a better restaurant i like i like jacket and tie
you know when you go out to dine it's we kind of make a night of it
but we try to order something that
have around the house
and as far as
mexican type we've got the only thing up here that we have anywhere close to that is taco bell
last month i spent a week in dallas
yeah
and then some of the local
guys down there they took me out to all of these places you know and it's really
it's unique i think i don't know if it's psychological or not but i think the beef down there is out of this world we just don't get the quality up here like you have
no we went to
i we stayed at the park
park plaza park suites
yeah
so we ate there one night and then we went to picci's one night and had italian you know where that is
can't really
tell you what part of the what part of
the town it was in but it was it's supposedly known it was up by one of the colleges anyhow
and
that was in the middle of the week and it was it was you had to wait in line to get in
like i said it was it was noted for you know it's food
picci's
and then oh no let's see i went someplace i can't remember the name of it some other place we went
but we went to one
and they serve you i mean the hamburger was a pound of meat
and the hamburger i know it was it was a huge loaf of bread i couldn't believe it
and then we went to some fast food places that you know during lunch we went out to some of those and it was good it was
i like mexican food i like the burritos and all that but i don't like the hot
i like it spicy but i don't like it i don't like it hot you know where you your
roof of your head's blown off
right and it doesn't make any difference either if you if you eat some of that stuff and you can drink a gallon and it doesn't seem to put out the fire but
and some people like that
me it seems like i don't know how about you do you like the extremely hot
yeah that's incredible that and
i'm afraid to take the chance when i go down there
to eat a meal like that
because once you get it what are you going to do with it if it if it's too hot
and i'm not sure if
you know if
when they cook down there if they automatically just do that they throw a couple of red peppers in it and
you know in the sauce
because that's what they're used to
and up here we're not really well some people are i guess up here i mean they'll eat fire
but i'm just not i'm not i don't mind the spices i love garlic and all the rest of that but
the hot stuff oh
and that's all you mainly do then right italians how about chinese
yeah you go out for chinese at all
oh yeah
yeah
that's what we'll do we'll take some we'll take out like sometimes on the weekend like snacks
you know like beef teriyaki or chicken fingers or that type of thing egg rolls
or fried rice because it's easier to get out than to make it
we'll do that occasionally do you go out as much now
as
because the economy being
such has that
put a damper on you or does it make any difference
oh yeah
yeah you know up here it's the restaurant business has fallen off
pretty substantially because the unemployment rate is pretty high
it's
in massachusetts it's almost ten percent now
so people don't have the discretionary incomes that they had you know overtime has been cut back a lot in certain areas
but us i mean we still we live more or less like you and our kids are grown up and they're gone so it's just the two of us and
we tend to go out maybe once a week maybe once every other week something like that but we'll go out for
take out
and bring it home
but it hasn't it hasn't it hasn't stopped us yet
and i was just wondering down there it hasn't done anything to you either so your economy is a little bit better though i think down there now
well
oh okay so there's
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
and it depends on life styles too down there i'm not sure if
you all tend to go out more down there than we do up here or if we tend to go out more
okay so which what basketball teams are you interested in
um-hum
um-hum
no they're more of a football team than they are basketball team
yeah
you know that's true i don't think i've ever seen them nationally on basketball
um-hum
hum
yeah that's not too bad
um-hum
well i'm originally from the saint louis area so the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is chicago so i do pull for chicago
i mean of course this year is a good year to be a chicago fan i guess because they're doing pretty good
yeah
as far as college teams i know it's really easy to say but i've been pulling for duke for about four years now so
so i finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams although i've really you know again being from saint louis i pull for missouri but they're on probation this year so you can't do much about that
but
oh yeah i watched every i watched all three games of that and i was very pleased with all three games because kansas you know i was pulling for kansas on the other side so it was it was real nice to have the teams that were there
of course i wasn't really i mean i
unlv kind of gave me the impression of being a oh i don't know a macho team you know they just didn't seem they seemed to think they were better than everybody else and maybe they were but i was real happy to see them get knocked off so
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah
um-hum
unlv yeah their they play the pro style is the way i've always called it and you know the fast breaks and
and you know that meant that they had to play a second half and they've not they've not had to do that all year and
yeah
that's right i mean duke's schedule was so much harder than unlv's that it just made them a much tougher team overall and that had to help them a lot
um-hum
so do i take it you think though that the lakers will win or
i mean portland's pretty good
yeah
yeah
no well he's i don't i he to me is not a center he's more of a real tall forward
i think magic does a
oh yeah
that sure is if
i think that's going to be one of those that's won by the home team you know whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one i think
-troit's in that same that same division
no but as i heard isaiah came back this week so that might help them
oh yeah
oh yeah
that's true
um-hum
um-hum well that's when you do it
yeah
oh
well the dark horse yeah that's
yeah anybody who has david robinson got to have a chance anyway
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
hum
yeah that's true
yeah well then he's gone now so they're going to have to do something about that well i thought he was gone period i didn't read the story but i read that
well that might have been what it was but i guess the headlines said something about him you know that the mavericks you know released him or something i'm maybe i misunderstood what they meant
well yeah
you never know yeah but
yeah
yeah
yeah it's coming up isn't it yeah
portland yeah portland
um-hum
they've got two the two johnson brothers or they're not brothers but i mean there's two guys named johnson on their team that are really good doing good or something i forget exactly how that worked but
they're like i said they're doing extremely good right now phoenix isn't doing too bad so it's it ought to be a real interesting play-off yeah
um-hum
um-hum
when it's on the line
um-hum
yep that's true
well it's been nice talking to you all right well take care bye
all right
what baseball teams do you follow
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum
yeah
uh-huh
oh i guess mainly the rangers such as they are
they do seem to have a pretty tough division though with oakland and kansas city and white sox all
jammed in there
oh i get to i don't know quite a few in the summer
yeah it looked like they're starting off kind of shaky but they they've gone i guess over five hundred now
i was hoping that no hitter that he threw would get them fired up a little bit
but it's hard to tell
i was trying to think they were up in a stand at detroit
i don't know if they're playing today or not
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah it says a lot for their future
oh i don't really follow them a whole lot i hear about them occasionally i've got a friend whose a trainer for one of their farm clubs
it's been probably three or four years since they were i think they finished second in their division i don't remember what they ended up last year third or fourth i guess
yeah they have been off and on maybe three or four times since they've been here
uh-huh
well they've been like a lot of teams and the minute they do real badly in the past they just got rid of their manager this is valentine's the first manager they've had in on you know any kind of length of time
and so hopefully he'll eventually put something together
uh-huh
yeah true
i guess i was feeling pretty confident about the team valentine this year until he got mad at pete incaviglia and just cut him for because he was upset at him
well i can understand his point i thought it was kind of childish to just cut him instead of trying to trade him because then detroit picks him up and
he started out real good for them and he he's gotten kind of shaky now
and i think they should have at least gotten something for him
yeah
i think so
yeah
yeah i think i think as long as he produces he and franco they run kind of hot and cold too
i think franco hit a home run was it last night to win the game
i think they won six to five and i think that was on his he hit a home run at the end and broke the tie up
hum
yeah i think the rangers have the pitching staff they need if they would just produce some offense they might do all right
yeah you said you were a cincinnati fan has all this brouhaha with pete rose over the years
caused you any distaste for them or
uh-huh
yeah
sure
uh-huh
well but it didn't seem to really hurt the team in fact seemed to kind of fire them up and make them work harder
after he was gone
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
really
you too bye-bye
are you a computer professional
but are you working at the texas instruments or are you at home
okay
what's your application for pc's
oh okay
um-hum
oh okay
well i got involved in computers because i have an interest in speech recognition
which is probably why i got involved in the ti switchboard project
yeah
well i bought a pc oh well i bought a series of personal computers of one kind or another but the latest one i bought for the children
to use for their educational games and for entertainment games
and i soon discovered that it was running faster than the ibm pcat that i had purchased to do my
postgraduate studies
and enhanced with
texas dsp board
and i'm using it for speech recognition research at this point
well i've gotten to the point where the program will phonetically label a sentence that i speak into the microphone
and it's just now up and running in that mode and i've got to make a lot of improvements and improve my models and
adjust coefficients and try to improve the performance a little bit but the first results look promising
i think we're getting to the point now where
there's a lot of people who've done research in a lot of individual areas and we're sort of entering the phase now where i think we're starting to pull some of these results together and getting them to work together
well not really but
well my company has expressed an interest and they've asked me to do a lot of research so
and a place named sonotek just to find out what their state of the art is and i see what's out there that can all be brought to bear on the problem
and i think the focus of my dissertation is to look at four different technologies that have already been researched and
see if i can't make them work together in synergy to get a step ahead
and so i think that's probably the way things will go in the future they'll start pulling together the different aspects of speech recognition i would say that there will be
well there'll certainly be a lot of commercial products on the market in the next five years
and there'll probably some be some very good systems available by the turn of the century
yeah there'll probably be some
you know reasonable breakthroughs in terms of bringing products to market
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah i think it's an interesting field and
my primary interest is in speech understanding
so once we get the basic word recognition or something resembling word recognition
my interest is in extracting the understanding and in developing man machine dialogue type operations like intelligent tutoring systems that
the tutoring system can sort of gain some insight into what the student knows or doesn't know and modify it's tutoring program accordingly
and getting the interactive speech is a key part of that
but
right
um-hum
well it's all of parallels techniques that teachers ordinarily use during the day they they're teaching a grade stool grade school student to
add and subtract they pose problems for them and they see where they make their mistakes in carrying or in borrowing or something like that and they then pose problems which will
you know point out the proper procedure and then test them again to see that they've learned that fact
and so that's where the artificial intelligence comes in is in -veloping that kind of an art in a machine
huh
right
hm
well how many credit cards do you have
and since the slips all look alike you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them out and it and it
it causes more confusion about it i finally said gee this is kind of a waste of time and then when at&t came along and offered a free one i accepted that and we've been using that one
the interesting thing is that the amount of money you can run up on them i don't know do you know any people that run up big bills
well did were you able to get one while you're in college
just curious because i have a son that's a senior this year and he's heading off with any kind of luck but there has been i've had a couple of ads for a for to provide a card for a college student
what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that
well that i guess from the from the card issuer that since it's in the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible but it's
yes it's whether the parent wants to take the risk
a convenience
yeah and the idea that you know if he got in trouble there's some ways of getting out and that he doesn't have to carry cash
the i like the idea of credit cards that i don't i don't i don't carry cash around and i don't even carry checks around i let my wife take the checkbook
she writes the checks and i record them so it's
it's but it's interesting that the people that can that can the amounts of money you can run up
on credit cards and i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer
and he had run up more than a years salary in various debts to
and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there it it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of
well it was a combination of things he had there were
there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but i guess what's interesting have you seen the ads where they're offering to extend payments on
things like the credit union's offering
yes
yeah
the interesting thing about that is that they're encouraging you to incur more incur more debt and
and they make more money if you extend your loan
yes
and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or they're not going to keep on if the car were older
the interesting thing about it is that from a an economy standpoint or in economics i thinks it's i think it's poor economics to carry all that consumer debt
at least from a tax standpoint so
it's interesting that the american public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year it's ten percent or so
it's interesting that they encourage us to do things
i think ten percent yes of your of your consumer credit
oh if you had a thousand dollars that means there's another hundred dollar deduction i've given you
yeah it's on yeah
yeah on the there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the
oh okay
it's on it's on schedule
schedule a under
well it's the same place it's the same place you put interest but see that's what that's what makes texas squirrelly laws that you can't you can't take out a second mortgage
like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so it's fully deductible the laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint
but
sounds like you're very financially responsible it's
that's there're a lot of people who really run my boss drives quite a ways to work and he's got just enormous debts and he's
i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts and but i agree with you i don't i try to limit my debts well i did buy a new house last summer that
it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car and that apparently that's been going on for a really long time i didn't do it i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year
yep
miscellaneous things like food -nd and other things these habits you get into eating and it's amazing how it what you learn
well anything else good to say about credit cards
i might just
you don't have to carry the cash and it's certainly accepted more places than the places you know it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state and
yeah
they don't allow they don't do
yeah huh
carry all that cash with you
well you know they
they've started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you
yeah and i think that's where
yeah i've seen a couple although the so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the time frame which they get paid
in general that they i've seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day my wife will write a check for groceries and
you know almost well i guess it's the day after technically it's two days but they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float but apparently that's why the
the grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high and they have
the profitability of the cash flow is a big issue for them so
anyway well it's good talking to you
maybe we'll get across we'll cross paths again good night
okay
yeah it's it it's a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year there's you know you see a little bit more rain
i mean by mid february i mean we start getting a lot of rain
but it
um-hum
later on that afternoon evening it was just it was horrible
yeah
yeah
well i don't know i guess i'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather i like it warmer i mean i like it
you know i like it warm but it doesn't really matter i mean i'd i would much rather see it cooler at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
but
you know it just swelter and then we got used to it and then we went up to dallas and it was just
yeah a little bit
yeah it
we were we were down there and
the last day right before we left we had to i had to ride with my sister and the air conditioning went out on the car and you know you -ust get used to air conditioning all the time
and this it was just the humidity was like eighty plus eighty percent plus and it was just killing us
yeah
you know it's just you know so mild and then been to such extremes like san angelo texas where you just where you walk outside and you sweat you know you're sweating
you look down at your arm but you see the water leaving your arm it's so hot and you feel it pulling away
bizarre
yeah
yeah
i tend to agree but
i don't know i think in some in some respects it
oh it seems more tolerable
well
uh-huh
i've been in the house i'm in here right now about twelve and a half years
um-hum
oh really
um-hum
um-hum
well i bet you have
uh-huh
um-hum
well that sounds interesting i bet he's enjoyed having it that way because some kind of hard to find one prebuilt that's kind of fits those specifications
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
well that my we've just got a two car garage but my husband's got a big space in between the where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything
and i at one time was gonna fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff
uh-huh
um-hum
and we've got grandchildren now so
when they come they have to have a place
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and little boys are around the house
a whole lot more than girls
and i enjoy them coming but for short doses
well i just watch them i dust i never did put things up when my kids were little and i haven't with a them i try to teach them not to get into things
so it's worked pretty well there's i don't really think anything's been broken every now and then we have to kind of go and say now don't bother this you know
but all in all they mind pretty well
but i guess most of the what kind of roof does your house have here i'm getting off the subject
did you attend public school
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes that's true they can't root out the troublemakers as easily
okay
yeah i never
yeah
yes vocational education we called it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and by spreading thin you mean they too many students or too many subjects per teacher or
uh-huh
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh were already paying this guy
yeah
i did i did and
i felt i got a very
i mean i feel i got a very poor education in general
but i think that i knew other people from other public schools who got better educations
in our case it think it was
you know the teachers again spread thin but maybe in terms of just having too many student to really
do the job
i'm sort of i have a two year old son now and so i'm starting to think about
education you know more critically and trying to figure out what we want to do and i'm just sort of turned off by the whole
the whole system where everyone sits facing the front of the room as quiet as possible while the teacher lectures especially for small children
it just seems like it's not the way they're going to learn best but when you have one teacher and thirty students what else can you do
you know i mean it seems like the style of teaching that we have grown to think of as normal i think is dictated by economics
in just in terms of student teacher ratios
no so far i'm just whining
i haven't done anything constructive yet we fantasize about homeschooling
but
we probably won't
although i could see where that would be that could be a lot of fun
um-hum
that's nice
um-hum
no we don't we have to pay for our own insurance
and we you know we do get the vacation but we don't get sick pay until we've been there a year
and then i think it starts after four days
if you've been gone five consecutive days then you get one day of sick pay
it's real tough
for benefits
uh-huh
right
that's the truth
uh-huh if you can get some good medical benefits it makes a big difference
um-hum
right
and you
um-hum
yeah i don't have any children but i do have my husband gets insurance paid through his company
but it's still cheaper for me to pay for mine through my job than it is to get onto his
um-hum
so
until he's been there a little longer then maybe i can you know get into that
but a little better but
right now
no i really don't i really think that benefits
help out a lot
you know with the positions
benefits you know like you said are almost better you know that's a lot of pay
if you thought if you think about health because i think my husband and i went to get health insurance from an outside agency once
and it would cost just me alone two hundred dollars a month
to get basic health insurance and if you think about that on top of your pay it makes a big difference
um-hum
uh-huh
it is unbelievable
that is just something else
because they're you know at the retirement age and
and that's something too that's just unbelievable
oh well that would be great
yeah my husband gets life insurance dental insurance and
life and dental and health
and then he also gets legal help legal aid
and he also gets like he's entered into a credit union and
and all that kind of helps out
uh-huh
well that's nice
um-hum
my sister where she works has the hmo
which is something that's
you know it's nice but you know it's great because you pay five dollars and you go
and your medicine is five dollars but if it's not an emergency you wait three months
to get in
um-hum and that is
trying to think which one that is but i'm not it's a real popular one
but
kaiser
yes
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i i'm going with aetna
well i'm just going to stay with the you know i can go to my doctor i think i pay two hundred and fifty dollar deductible and that's it
but yeah because she you know was trying to get into like an eye doctor or something like that and if it's not an emergency you wait for quite a while to get in
yes
it's not yeah my isn't either but through the hmo it is
and i think eyes and about every doctor you could about
all right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
rehabilitate or you know restore anybody i think it'll only make them worse but i believe that god can come in and change a person's heart
and genuinely change it but that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow and if you do kill a person and it is
you know you're found to be guilty i believe god establishes the authority of our court system and i believe that you know that i do believe that capital punishment is
alternative even you know god can still change your heart but that doesn't mean like the alcoholic that charges up all the
bills on the credit card or the shopaholic you know you get your life right with god but you still have to pay your visa bill you still have to
you know so but god sent us his grace and they give pardons but i believe if it's a genuine conversion there's a genuine and those prison people know they know a genuine
turnaround in a person's character they see that and i worked in a prison in fort worth
yeah i have a degree in social work you see it you know the ones that have a genuine character change it is obvious and they know that they're not going to pardon someone from the governor
you know what i'm saying they're not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison so i feel like you know that's is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives and you know i leave that with the governor who
of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be reelected so
uh-huh
punishment uh-huh
no that's okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
right but in the old
yeah
right
we don't well yeah we definitely have lost the judeo-christian ethic of the judicial system for sure but the base is still there the foundation is still there though
of the system but i know what you're saying but also they're under a law because we haven't been removed from the law we've just been taken out from under a law because under the law if your child back talked you he would be stoned
yeah under the law he would be stoned so we've been removed from the law of from being under the law but we're still you know we're still accountable to it we don't need to back talk but
you know it's like god changes your heart to not do that he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust because in the old testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it
but in the new he's looking at your heart and so i guess that's what i mean by their character changes and you know what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here and
those and then any of if i don't think see if i don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused i believe for murder rape i even believe incest things
that will permanently damage the character of the child i believe crimes against children should be punished by death i believe
sexual crimes unless there's a true change of character and that's where we just have to trust the authorities and they're not going to excuse people if it was run like that i don't there would probably be very few exceptions to
that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and but it's not because the judicial system has rejected they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-hum yeah
yeah
anybody yeah
yeah
right
i know in jamaica it think it's jamaica i think it's jamaica i know that they have you know crimes punishable by death and i'm sure they hit a few every now and then and i wouldn't want to be one of them that are not guilty
but i know that they have like their crime rate it's not jamaica i don't think i can't remember which it's one of the caribbean islands and they
singapore is it like that my husband's going singapore and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and that's what when you have lawlessness
i mean the law's not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness we were we went on a mission trip to manhattan
and to the bronx and stuff two years ago and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack and everyone was out we were across from
that big bus station i forget what you call it but anyway and everyone they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence and within two hours there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing
and you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days
because there's no the answer is not being given to them in the court system and i think initially when our country was set up it was set up with god and it was really an integral part and no you can't
you can't force people but i think people are hurting and they're out doing crack sitting on the street they were the kind of people that i think mostly we would want to receive it if it was presented to see i don't know i guess i'm kind of frustrated that
you know we've gotten away from the christian basis that our court system was founded upon i mean it reeks of the bible just the whole thing the whole system and so i feel like if that was presented
more openly and not just relying upon and para church ministry to come in and do it but that the system itself you know you know what i mean
i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include you know you know and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with
right
right
yeah
yeah
right
right
yeah i know you're right they would lobby that and i see that and that's why you know i'm like
i have not like i was saying i have not had to make the decision for
regarding care for anyone of my family members however i've had quite a few friends that have had to make that decision
oh really
man yeah
huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
it's a
uh-huh yeah i think there's so many that are that are you know retirement homes
that are geared towards the ambulatory you know the ambulatory person that is still
extremely active and just wishes not to have to live alone you know
separate any longer and then there are the nursing homes which actually provide you know nursing care i guess it goes there's a wide range
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
that's true that's what i would be afraid of i would rather personally i would rather be in a community of other people with
a greater chance of having similar interest with them
rather than being stuck in a home where i mean if you if you couldn't drive i guess i mean if you're no longer have the freedom of driving
i don't think i would like that i think i would rather
if i were in that situation i think i would rather live in a in a nursing home situation
uh-huh
no
uh-huh
yeah that's true
that's true
that's true and the nurses that they hire are
frequently not the most qualified in their field
and
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right
right i think
yeah
i mean she died when she was ninety six and
from a fall i mean she didn't even die of natural causes she died from a fall she you know had she been younger it would not she would not have died from the fall but
her age that had prevented her but she was she was very afraid that someone would try to put her in a nursing home and she lived with her daughter my grandmother until she died and my grandmother still at seventy
she's seventy nine this year is living independently
i think that for so many people that the nursing home represent obviously different things and depending on the level of function
whereas my you know my grandmother doesn't need any extra camaraderie or anything like that because she gets it from her church or from her friends that come by but
i've seen a lot of people that don't live near their family or don't have you know significant roots in this in their little community they've been uprooted for some reason or another
and they i think that it would be good for them to be into a situation that
would offer them oh activities to maintain an active mind
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that's not living right exactly
exactly
yeah
for what they are they're a true natural resource and they cherish them and yet i mean we as americans are such a throw away society
that we've basically done that with generations of people that have so called outlived their usefulness
you know i think that's an atrocity and i'm fortunate enough that i've had my relatives have lived very long full lives and
yeah
oh well if you if you had all your all the money in the world or something i
yeah
oh really
well
uh-huh
what do you have now
oh really yeah we just we well i have my car is the first one we ever bought new too but we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually
mine is a honda accord
yeah i do and it's funny because after i bought it i was doing a lot of business traveling and i some of the cars that i got were like the toyota camry and the nissan maxima and some of the competitors
and i didn't like them as well except it wasn't really fair comparison because those were automatics and mine is a standard and the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better it had a lot more pickup and everything
uh-huh
usually avis
avis yeah
well it's just because we're on i think of it i'm not sure if those are avis or not but we have corporate contracts
work for ti um-hum which is how i heard about this
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
it did wow
oh my gosh
oh i see okay
oh well you got your money's worth
yeah
yeah that is good
yeah well i've been lucky mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it
but i was real lucky because it just hit the lens to the light it didn't actually dent the car or anything so it cost me twenty five bucks to replace that
and the store will pay for it anyway so
no big deal
i probably wouldn't just because we already have one
but you know if i had to make the choice again i yeah i'd i'm perfectly happy with what i decided although we did just buy another car and that's a legend but it's a used one
and my husband has really wanted one for a long time and the fact that you know this car this car that i have has performed so well and before that i also had an accord it was a real old one
and i bought that used i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that and it served me real well too so he's been impressed with all the honda cars
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
how did it go for you
yeah i know
yeah
really
i can't drive that the legend it's just so huge i don't like it and it's so
have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either
offering a service or
they're introducing some new product in the area and
normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone
that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours
and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
or you hear somebody already starting reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already
even had some of them the
they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything
what i would love to see done to stop all of this
we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted
i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences
i put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people
peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their salesman to come out
now i agree with their right to
pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them otherwise i don't want to know they exist
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in
i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get
wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment
but i consider invasion of my privacy
a harassment in itself
i believe we've pretty much summed everything up
i'm drawing the blank
pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you
and take it easy now good night
sounds like you've got this
the it's kind of fun because i had picked the same topic last time i dialed in and you know which i didn't know it would do
you know one of the things they're trying to think of is ways
you could create or maybe create is wrong but advocate a societal imperative that would have the same goal how could you make it
more desired and respected in society for people to voluntarily engage in public service
um-hum
yeah
yeah the what do you call it
not sure how you would do that outside of a government sector though and
you know i kind of hope against reality sadly that government sector will get smaller with time but every indication is that it won't
yeah
when there's a real need there's usually no shortage of volunteers you know you look at what happened in california with the earthquake there were plenty of people volunteering you know you look at world war two there were plenty of volunteers
you look at from the war in vietnam all of a sudden there weren't a whole lot of volunteers
and
you know the question of when do you quote need unquoted on say for example a draft maybe it should be the other way around maybe
the willingness of people to volunteer should be determining whether you need it or not
i don't perceive myself as a pacifist by any means
but
you know there are probably there are places we've been over the years that perhaps we shouldn't have
ah i don't think every time we wandered into some place it was honest just in itself i think we've screwed up a few times just like everybody else
indeed
and someone who is enthusiastic but lacks the skill i'll take the enthusiasm any day cause you can train that person
but somebody that's got no incentive i'm not really sure what you can do
no that was before my time
uh-huh
was it like wpa
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
unemployed people whether it's volunteers what have you you've got this resource and what is the best way to target where you're going to point it
so what do you what's your opinion on the our policy down there
yeah
yeah the only thing that i pretty much know about is the central american policy where you know they're just
trying to
you know military action in panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now
and then
right
right well that's what i was about to say we didn't do anything
yeah that is that is pretty risky
i mean
uh-huh
um-hum
he takes more risks
yeah he was
yeah it seems that the policies of pretty much anywhere not just in central america that us has now is you know more action than just words than just rhetoric
i don't know how long it's going to last
yeah
well i don't think it's possible because even though you know we're against them i don't think we can go into another country
and do something about the other country's problem
yeah but no but see the thing when panama was the that noriega was
was wanted either the fbi by the fbi and therefore they had a reason but to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different
because
right
no i didn't
oh the drug problem um-hum
yeah
what i don't think i don't think the problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon i mean
you know it i think it pretty much got sidetracked with
with the panama and with the you know middle east problems things that are more important take precedent precedence over
the drugs i think
i think i think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front and you know it it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is failing so they're going to have to go to the source
don't want to admit it yet
right
yep
yeah that's true
yeah
depends on how much power you have and who you know
yeah
probably
yeah i think we're trying to stay friendly with the brazilian and argentinean governments because they're producing so much agricultural exports
we don't want to piss them off and have them over produce and then because then our economy would be pretty bad
yeah
i think it's going to have to get worse before it gets better you know the same old cliche
right
right
and they'll just pick crooked people again
and then people the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again and it'll all
be for nothing
yeah
well i guess that's about five minutes
appreciate talking to you
now what was that book what was that book that you were saying to read again
a clear and present danger
all right
okay all right
all right thanks a lot all right bye
they can be deceiving to people i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in tyler who had two or three centers
all over you know the city and they would be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left
so i think you need to make you know if you do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks
and to check in on them when they're not expecting it because they do things differently when you're not around
so
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
well this one was set up good i mean they had two teachers to every room
sometimes three and they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool
the problem i had was that
they did not show affection to the children enough they did not show them care to these small children who are being left
they
one time i picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side and down the other you know he said you are gonna have every child in here wanting you to pick them up
and i said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know what is your problem
so
yes
right they did they had like the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room the ones that were starting to walk in one room then they had like the three year olds
upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives you know just like that
you know they really did separate them well it was just the teachers themselves
right but yeah that they're not
yeah their system
right but their but their system was great but the
you know the caring just wasn't there the one woman that taught that did the babies
i worked with her and she was fabulous she loved them babies and she loved them and cared for them but every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and
you know would make me a nervous wreck so you know
yeah these kids are just in a day care center all day
and with no any type of emotional
you know getting love getting care they're just there
you know going through this routine which is lousy
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah you don't see that much
that's cute
yeah that has to be with a day care center
i've never heard of that that's a new one on me
uh-huh
so i guess it's subject is gun control
um-hum
um-hum yeah i sort of believe the same way i think i'm probably considered more of a conservative but i still think that
with regards to gun control the
like convicted felons you know they shouldn't be able to have one also i'm in
if you look at it like say a waiting period i'm in favor of a waiting period as just that a waiting period before
someone buys a handgun and like i say a week or two weeks as a cooling off period but i guess the nra they kind of look at it as a springboard towards more restrictive gun controls and
so i can kind of see both sides of the of the issue on that
um-hum
yeah um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that is true as a as a toy you know i mean if you call a gun a toy they would be it would be interesting to have one shoot one but
but you're right there's no real legitimate need for one unless you consider
like personal defense like if your home or something that's it's kind of extreme i don't personally own one but
it's really it really is a touchy issue i know
the like you mentioned the plastic handguns the glock
it seems to me like that weapon they could it seems to me like they could bypass all the i think the major concern is that they think
that it can be slipped through airport security like it say invisible x rays seems to me like technically that'd be very simple to solve just put some sort of a
a metal flake or something that would show up on x rays you know it to show the outline of the gun and then you'd still have the advantages of the gun which is i believe light weight and it would
uh-huh
um-hum
but they might even get a little carried away you know with the lobbying and whatnot but
yeah
uh-huh
okay now you can tell me what you do
uh-huh
oh great
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well the one john works for seems to have a you know
good benefits and the pay is decent
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
oh
right
um-hum do you have major medical benefits
that helps some if it depends on what your deductible is how high it is
each person yeah that's pretty that's pretty high
right that's right that's
and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too
yeah i know where my daughter works now she course we live in a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all and her wage is not
but it's a it's a type of area we live in of course living expenses aren't as bad either though which makes a difference
well she has to pay for it herself you know they have to pay for their own insurance but
well
from what i've seen from my aunt and uncle really from florida up to here they're not that much different
uh-huh
is that right
uh-huh
oh that's a big difference
uh-huh
oh yeah should be
and it'd be much more convenient yeah it would be more convenient too um-hum oh yeah my other daughter works and has they have to take their two children to day care you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh
i don't know i think those benefits you mentioned sometimes they're even more important than you the wage itself
if you can get those benefits even they come out to much a much better benefit than an increase in your wage a lot of times
uh-huh
oh yeah oh yeah it make it a lot better
uh-huh
well and if it was there you would really have a little more knowledge on what's going on probably you know with your child
right yeah
right yeah
i don't know my daughter one daughter works for mci and they don't they where she works they don't have anything like that
pittsburgh
pittsburgh pennsylvania
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
oh so they were very flexible and that would be great yeah
um-hum
they say you're going to do it this way and that's the way it's going to be yeah
um-hum
yeah
true well that's true in any company i think
i've never well i can't say i've never i've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the you know out of the home
uh-huh
um-hum and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
usually consultants make very good income
is that right
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah and they'll do it
part of the city has been given these plastic garbage cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out
i don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that though
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's the grocery stores here have usually have some bins for the plastic bag recycling and some of the plastic jugs and bottle type things
uh-huh
we don't have very i do not know of a very good place for glass here
but i don't i would not know where to take glass
oh yes they'll recycle those we have places for those and for a while they were the newspapers there were places but i think they had so many newspapers now they are kind of discouraging us from taking them any place
um-hum
uh-huh
i see
uh-huh
hum
yes
oh that's a good idea
oh
but do you all have any place around there for used oil car oil
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
right uh-huh
my goodness
huh well we do ours ourself and we take it to a
ah sometimes when i hear what they're even what the politicians are making you know when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that ah
and that's all tax money when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much it's just billions of dollars that's i think is just being thrown away
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it's never the person that's making a hundred thousand there it's always the person that's making the least amount and
ah and sometimes we're running around there i see these ah
ah supervisors running around ah having meetings i really don't know what they do i sometimes wonder are they really doing anything or
yeah
yeah
well they got so many hidden taxes that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store or something like that and you're paying a little tax here and you
so yeah gas i don't know about you guys i but there's probably at least about twenty five to thirty cents of different taxes on our gas
and you don't realize it
yeah
so i mean to me it did raise my taxes
yeah i heard someone say that
if they would just something about with the
the defense budget all that extra money they're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars
period and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it
until the kids you were little
yes there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day
and then
and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job
and your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and we have these wonderful people who are
who are totally prepared to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and
and we'll see how the generations go huh
yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on what she did i've i was an engineer with
mechanical engineer with t i
and i did it for six years
and for one well i had one while i was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old
and it just drove me crazy
i could not do either well i couldn't put in enough overtime that was or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays
as is you know as is needed and because my husband had for a long time was out of the country
also with work for like three months and
yeah
yeah
it might have been better
yeah
yeah and so it was in my case i just decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once
i have i have branched out i was a photographer before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer
that it would just have to be a hobby and i'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for six years
and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great but i was bored part of the time too and i wanted something else
to do
yeah and it's great while they're really little but as they get older
and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different i mean it he goes to a mother's day out program now once a week both of my kids do
and so they're getting they get the socialization with other kids and you know and not really school but
but a different authority than mom once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society
yeah i think they do too
um-hum
and enjoy it that's the whole thing
yeah
yeah i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next
ten even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time
because if i if i had been allowed to work
you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week
i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy
and now with the photography that's you know it's working that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the week and use those hours to do the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures
in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that so my kids
can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband if it's you know when he's at home can take care of them
i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well
it's going to have to be both
yeah
you know it's just convincing your husband that's important or that it's important enough for him to do it because if he saw mom
doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it
yes and
yeah and without and it's just they don't look at things most men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it
and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be this is the time this needs to be done but
that's right
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
and i think that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much
this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were
needed to be done they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned
and it's gonna
it's gonna yeah some kids are really having it if they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values
and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little
you know this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because i it's you know when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older
but if no one does anything when they're little
then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older
yeah
that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work
but i think
if we can if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i know i know mine almost never did
well what hobbies do you have
oh you do
are you making an afghan
oh how wonderful
oh my goodness
well i have a sister-in-law who had a baby at age
forty and i think again at forty three so she's
but i'm expecting too so on my first
but i don't the only thing i really have done in the past is
cross stitch and needlepoint
i had learned to crochet some things you know those little kitchen towels
where you cut a towel in half and you sew the top part on so you can i mean crochet the top part of it so that you can attach it to an oven
i've done that kind of stuff but i haven't done anything as big as an afghan
do you do that often
um-hum
hum
i just haven't been
oh i think i learned how to do that when i was real young too one thing i'd kind of like to learn how to do is quilt
i see so many beautiful quilts and i have friends that make them but you know there's just seems like there's not that amount of time nowadays
you know because i work full-time outside the home
right now anyway i hope that'll change after the baby gets here but
and then you don't have the time because you're tending to the child
but it would be fun to learn how to do a few of those things
right
hum
yeah i think that's true like some people make decorating their house a hobby
and i have a friend who she and i both got into our houses around the same time and she's real she has a knack for that
you know she made her own curtains and i would love to be able to do all of that but i don't feel that i have quite the knack that she does
and so you know we're thinking of hiring a decorator and stuff and i sometimes feel like you know that's a cop out but yet
if i don't want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or you know not be satisfied with it
but my mother had that same knack you know for decorating and it probably just comes with age and with years of you know
hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
we in fact mending even kind of has gone by the wayside for most for many people if they get a hole in their sark sock
they don't darn it they
but
yeah there's a lot of things that i think that i'd like to do
but i don't make the time to do them you know and i keep thinking oh well when this happens then i'll have more time to do it and
because i like committing a great amount of time to something if i'm working on it
good morning
oh very good because actually when i was in college i visited mexico several times i was in the peace corps and peru but recently i have been following the middle east rather than
central america
right
right
um-hum
did that have
so you don't you don't feel that we were
exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting and they weren't
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh did we tend to change their attitudes like
some times when americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt american things americanism consumer products tv the whole works
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i was in peru
but
i there weren't as i recall or at least i wasn't aware of that many americans there except for a very heavy concentration of peace corps volunteers this was when the peace corps first are started and it was one of the big targets
and i don't i don't think at that time at least peace corps was
but and i was working actually in the savings and loan program so that was quite specialized although i was living in the slums i was really working with the middle class
i was up in arequipa
and
uh-huh
so
i don't have any idea probably not i mean there were i was peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine
that had gone in and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development and they were building schools and doing coops and things like that health inoculation and things
no i believe they did because some of some of the peace corps that i knew of did marry peruvians
and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things and of course the savings and loan program
that was that you know that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread and then of course peace corps bowed out of that because that's
something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops
right
uh-huh
yeah i've you know some of the programs i would have concern about like the language teaching you know i mean
why should we push english and a lot of people were down there teaching english and when they talked about hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting peace corps to teach
language you know to me that's a little bit marginal i did teach economics at the university one night a week and the textbook was in english but basically i taught it in spanish because i mean
i really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test
so what do you think about it
for the worst i would assume
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i'll tell you i don't know i don't know whether i count the stink as part of air pollution and it stinks down here
it depends on where you are now if you're over
yeah if you if you're over by asheville you're pretty good because you're up there in the mountains and you've got some nice ozone and all that
over here in raleigh it's kind of flat and stagnant and
just yucky
it's fine over on the coast because you've got the you've got the breezes off the off the water there
but seems like it's just dull and uninspiring here
no i don't know they're they keep doing things and it doesn't seem to be doing any good
i was i was really amazed because i never would have expected you know this problem somewhere like in atlanta
and i drove through atlanta couple of weeks ago and it was unseasonably warm
and you could see the smog just sitting on top of the city
and when i drove through i was it was terrible i had to keep the windows up
it was just so thick and
heavy
i couldn't believe it i because i used to live in atlanta years ago and it was always fairly clean i mean you always you didn't have problem with stagnant air like la does
but boy it was really bad that day
and it
yeah
yeah right
but you see all these all these trucks belching out this black smoke
yeah i know it's
i don't understand where the priority is it's like in atlanta they have they have mandatory catalytic converter inspections
there's only three places in georgia that requires that
and even with that it hasn't done any good
i mean obviously it's gotten a lot worse
but you know just like you say you go through there and you watch all these trucks and they're just coughing out all kinds of stuff some of them spitting it out so thick you can't even see past it
you know i don't know
uh-huh yeah because of the stuff settles on it
yeah
yeah
i don't know things like you know well like acid rain and all these sulphur dioxides being dumped out there
i i'm more worried about that than i am just about anything else
because
it's all i mean it's just it's just like a big avalanche you know you start putting sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and you end up with acid rain acid rain kills trees
the trees don't scrub the air and there you are
and then of course you've got all these folks cutting down on the rain forest as quick as they can
i wonder too you know they keep talking about ozone depletion and all this
it seems funny that it's coming around at the time when we're losing the most of the forests
because i think that a lot of the pollutants and stuff are being taken out of the air
you know by the plants and the trees and all that good stuff and here we are losing it and now the now it doesn't have any where to go
but
uh-huh yeah well it's like our winter here i mean it was the winter that wasn't you know we were having hot days in december and january
and got in
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah you might as well sell it for scrap or something because you probably never will use it
it's a shame too because i miss all the cold weather i enjoy winter
yeah
yeah it was an interesting day the other day i think it was yeah it was last not this past friday but friday a week ago
we i don't know i think you had some bad weather up there too we had tornadoes and everything down here
that was the most historic weather day in recorded history for severe weather in the country
on that one day i mean you know of course you always have severe weather somewhere
but there was more of it on that one day than ever recorded before over four hundred reports of tornadoes hail and heavy winds
amazing
it's a little bit scary
yeah
i read an article a couple weeks ago they were talking about talking again about the ozone layer they said that the
the ozone deterioration is greater than they had originally thought over some of the major metropolitan areas that's a little bit scary to think about
because that's certainly not going to improve things around there
yeah
well that's yeah that had that had been the thing that had always i mean i have always thought about the ozone layer as sort of like a layer and it would move around i didn't know that the hole just stayed there
you know i guess i i'm not that much of a meteorologist
but yeah i was a little surprised at that too because up to that point all i'd heard about was the one over the pole
and i said well i'm not too awfully concerned about that if it's going to start melting the ice cap it's not going to be for a long time yet
yeah
yeah course the ozone is up there so
yeah i mean i don't even know i don't even know if the ozone layer does move i mean apparently it doesn't but
yeah i'll tell you i was real excited when i first heard that i said hot dog they finally did it you know
i
i mean i'm
yeah i mean i'm an old science fiction buff from way back when i was a little boy and this is the kind of stuff that science fiction was made out of
and it's the days that i keep looking for that aren't going to happen in my lifetime
you know we're supposed to have moon colonies by now
but yeah cold fusion would have been great
could have gone might have started making a little inroads on air pollution with that
but who knows
yeah
yeah there's always a drawback to everything i mean
i don't know
well
so
oh
oh okay
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
and i felt i felt like boy i was sure was missing a lot and they were growing so fast and
uh-huh
yeah
wow that's great
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
ah that's great because that's
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah kind of grows on and
they do what they see and you know
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh yeah
yeah plus you teach middle school so i'm sure that
you are really you really boy oh boy i taught early childhood so i had the little ones
and you know i saw it there too and you know you just
oh it's it kind of an eye-opener you know so
um-hum
yeah i think you're right
yeah
right
-ay
yeah
i agree yeah
yeah
yeah i agree i know exactly what you're saying
okay
well actually what i do i haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months
so i haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater but i rent probably four or five movies a week
we've got a good video place out here and oh gosh
i'm just trying to think of all the movies i've recently seen
oh air america
have you seen wild orchid
well it depends do you like steamy movies
oh okay what type of movies do you like
okay
yeah
do you like suspense movies or do you like just action or
oh jagged edge jagged edge was a suspenseful one or fatal attraction
what was your favorite all time movie
i have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most that i was really the most in shock with was probably star wars
when that first came out i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that i mean
now i also liked oh gone with the wind or some of the classic like the lawrence of arabia
oh you haven't
oh yeah
no that's a that's a real interesting movie and it's got a good historical perspective to it
oh yeah
and it's about al capone's brothers
primarily one of his brothers and i won't give the whole plot away but it's really a good movie al capone had three brothers
and one of them was lost for many years
and he actually he turns out to be a law man
yeah it's really interesting it
yeah it is
and a lot of times what i wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress
and seeing like all i've seen all of james dean's movies
all of mae west's movies
and just kind of kind of go out and rent all the movies and
you know just kind of go i guess you could do that you know get all of david carradine's movies or segal to what's his first name
i can't remember his first name
is it david segal
i don't know he was on arsenio
just recently
it was really kind of interesting because arsenio was asking him about
what he thought of one of the other action guys god i can't even remember the name he said well he wouldn't really
talk about it didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a good action guy
it wasn't stallone it was
i can't remember
shoot
i can't remember the guys name
but i like all the rambo movies
yeah
yo adrian
no we actually rent probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films
don't watch really very many horror films at all
you know i don't know there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something you know it's just you know
coming out of the tv that just doesn't make my day you know
yeah
yeah
i just saw a really interesting movie called flatliners
yeah
yeah
it was just crazy enough for you know students might try to do it
you know i mean and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it
yeah
yeah
oh yeah that was a great movie
yeah
have you seen shrimp on the barbie
no
no hogan yeah no
no it's got cheech marin
yeah
yeah it is it's kind of kind of a poor man's pretty woman in reverse
but it was kind of cute actually did you see dirty rotten scoundrels
i though that was a really cute movie i enjoyed that
yeah
no i haven't
i hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video
well my wife has got a picture from kevin costner and he signed it it's from dances with wolves yeah and he signed it he happens to be a friend of one of her business associates
and all right not a friend a cousin
a cousin so but anyhow we got we got a nice picture and it came in an envelope that says dances with wolves so we've got to try to get out there and see that one
huh
now did you see driving miss daisy
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah are your
schools paid for primarily with your real estate tax
yeah what for a typical middle class house what kind of annual tax do you pay
well i know it's split federal and so forth
uh-huh
um-hum
they are
oh okay because over here
you could pay between four and eight thousand dollars a year
and
matter of fact i'll bet it's not as good
my feeling is that
there you know while there are certain problems where
you know being able to buy a new set of books or a new piece of equipment may be valuable by and large that correlation between the amount of money you shovel in and the quality of education doesn't seem to be that strong
well again i don't know what it's like on your side of the fence over here
teachers' salaries aren't bad they're not executive type salaries although if you're a
yeah
thing is there are nonfinancial there should be nonfinancial benefits to teaching that i think we've managed to squash out of the system
it used to be thirty years ago being a teacher was a position of respect you were educating the young
now it seems you know now the joke of the year is you know those who can't teach
and you know so something went wrong somewhere along the line and i think it's felt both by the people in the educational profession and those outside
there's a wonderful book by a fellow named charles murray
called in pursuit of happiness
and he discusses what he feels is wrong with the educational system
and
he even offers some suggestions for improvements one of the points he makes is he feels that any attempt to fix the problems
whatever the nature of the reform is the administration of the reform will be captured by the union and rendered ineffective
in other words if you decide that you're gonna pump another ten percent money in it'll right eventually filter down it filters it's way around to the most firmly entrenched teachers with no regard to their skill level if you provide other benefits
they'll eventually work their way around to more firmly entrench the problems not to resolve them
i'm not sure i agree with him completely but he makes some interesting points
um-hum
well it did change the thing to do is find out why because
you know there was a time when the teacher was a respected individual and something changed and intrinsically the ideas you know training our
the youth of the country to be mature productive responsible citizens is potentially a
a very what's the right word
now
absolutely i have a wife who substitute teaches and she brings home some interesting stories but the thing that you know i hate falling into the trap of back when i was a kid
i'm just saying that but the thing that changed is
back when i was a kid you know maybe hated the teacher maybe you didn't do your work but you respected or at least feared the
well i don't know i think the budget is really out of hand right now and especially in this election year i think that
there ought to be at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this
right
right and well as you said mostly they are token cuts especially what for instance george bush is offering
yeah ninety seven cents a week now what that's really not gonna do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know another ninety seven cents hell you can buy a coke or something for that
yeah
nah that ninety seven cents really isn't gonna do it for me either
i haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either especially the democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could
do something to affect our budget at this point
i believe it was dukakis but i can't
yeah i mean that's better than george bush who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i can't follow through on this but it seems to me that
that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of x number of billion trillion dollars a year well i'd really like to know where that money is actually gonna go because
in my opinion i don't think i'm ever gonna see any of this peace so called peace dividend
i mean if they could actually put something together and make i'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because i feel that they waste money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works
projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
right
exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the structure of the country
yeah and there's no way that we can ever really recover from the state that we're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now
so am i
iu
uh-huh
um-hum
right
right
uh-huh
right
you just have to wonder what they're thinking in washington
yeah well it's more than a loaded it's a loaded cannon i mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money
oh no
uh-huh
for the for the moment and that's what really is getting me about what george bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am gonna give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come november and you'll elect me again
and then i'm gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesn't seem that it's gonna make much of a difference
no not at all
no
hi my name's nicole
where are you mary ann
it would
yes it would okay are you do you know about the topic
okay
all right i'm going to push one
yes one time one time but we found him innocent so
yes it was this guy bit another guy's finger off
but he deserved it i probably would have bit his finger off too if he was trying to strangle me or beat me up you know if i could have gotten his hand in my mouth i'd have bit him just like this guy did he was scared he was a kid
you know and the guy was trying to beat him up this older teenager was shacking up with this guy's ex-wife or they were
they were really in a mess and there were children involved and it was just terrible but i didn't think anybody you know they all deserved to go to jail not just the one guy you know
it really was he was trying to beat him up so you know we found him innocent so i really don't know what happens after you find them guilty i thought that the judge did do the sentencing
oh
good grief that would be hard to do you know
yeah
yeah whether he's guilty or yeah that's true
um-hum
is it different in different states do you know
because i know on some at times the news you know and they say the judge gives the sentencing and so that's what i guess i thought it was that way everywhere being as i hadn't been all the way through you know anything like that
state yeah
yeah
well i wouldn't oh that would be hard
it would be hard to sentence somebody to death if you weren't really sure
you'd have to be really sure that he did it
i mean really sure
oh
yeah
so i enjoy doing it
as long as i get paid well now before i worked for ti and i didn't get time off for jury duty you know it was difficult
because there are a lot of places that don't give you i mean they give you the time but not the pay
i think it's eight it might i don't remember
well they send you a free bus ticket and i use it
so you know i come out pretty good on it i mean i and plus my ti money i come out real good on it now the last one i served on i was working at ti and so i got time off for it but i was working third shift and that made it a little difficult
to decide
yeah to decide which day to take off and you know do you take off day
after you go or before you go
so it was tough so but anyway well i don't have much more to say about it
i think if anybody has a doubt you need to yeah i do feel that yes i really do
yeah
because someone might see something that you don't see i mean you know they may have they may have picked up on something that gave them that doubt that
you know yeah i really think everybody needs to agree
yeah
yeah
yeah well you know that i mean i you have to agree on this almost i would think can't imagine
not agreeing that everybody should agree on a jury i don't know on when we all really agreed on this did you all have any disagreements when you were doing the sentencing
i can't remember how many it didn't take us but an hour i think or an hour and a half we were all pretty i think we had one man in there that
wanted to find him guilty because he kept saying he did it then we kept saying he did it but the other guy you know we had to convince him that
yes finally we it didn't take
uh-huh
that's a good way of looking at it
uh-huh
slightly liberal to the left or to the right
what'd you say
i see huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i get my news from really from all the sources i will say probably radio is
is a prime source because i like to listen to radio news on the hour for world news and then it the station i listen to usually have local news after that and i also watch the tv for
for news and i take two newspaper the local city newspaper here in portsmouth and also the state newspaper which is the manchester union leader so
you know that's how i stay informed plus from talking to people as you say if it's real important you're going to hear about it from other people besides
um-hum
right
uh-huh
no
but you do but you do i take it
uh-huh
uh-huh
i see
um-hum
um-hum
well we have a sports interaction with quebec mainly montreal the teams there both baseball and with hockey of course and with quebec and quebec city
and also one of the tv stations from canada is on the cable system in this area from sherbrook
so we do have some news from canada from time to time
do you have cnn do you have cnn
that can be an important source of news international
um-hum
right
well in my case my husband is not a carpenter but in fact he's in electronics but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it
so it took him about two and a half years
but he built us a house
it's we have thirty two hundred square feet
and it's a brick house
and pricewise it wasn't great because he did it all hisself you know so that way he could we could kind of control in control it
and we live in kind of a small town
and i mean it's nothing fancy you know it's a house it's nice and it's real pretty and we're all comfortable in it
oh you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else
you know
so but of course my husband did everything except my brother's a trim carpenter and he came in you know and did the inside for us
and that helped and yes and we had to hire course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know he did everything else
we've been in it six years
no well our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before when they get a lot older we don't need such a large house
uh-huh
yeah oh
uh-huh
yes
but like i said otherwise you know a the expense but you know we could not had one as large as we have if you know we hadn't did it ourself
that's right that's right
because i i'm always shocked at about you know what they've have it appraised at i think oh my goodness
okay and it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye
you know i was i was thinking about that while i was waiting for the connection i think you know it's a military threat certainly i don't feel like it's like it was back in the sixties whenever kruschev said he was going to bury us
at the same time i think they may still be a threat in a different sort of a way in that the situation over there is so unstable
and the especially the economics ramifications of whatever is going to happen over there i mean they're like a quarter of the land mass of the earth
you know and if things don't get straightened out over there it will impact us one way or the other i think
is that right i hadn't heard that
yeah or any one of the other nuts that are running around yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well it's i don't know it's amazing to see the kind of changes that's happened just in the past you know not even ten years or even five years it's just awesome
yeah
yeah
yeah but even so he seems to be a much more reasonable person than you know previous soviet leaders
and
they had last night i think it was on abc where some soviet doctors had gone on strike because their
monthly salary was about enough money to buy them six pounds of sausage with you know the new increase in prices
which is you know of course doctors over there aren't held in the same rare high esteem that they have here in the us
but
yeah
huh
yeah you know i would even consider moving to iraq for that i mean
well anyway it's
yeah well as a matter of fact i know that you know they were concerned about the soviet brain drain because there're so many of their top people just like you say they
you know are being given offers elsewhere and some of them i think are even coming to the us if we can get them you know rather than let them go to one of those third world countries
it's good for us to look after our own best interests even in you know an international way but at the same time i don't think that we have the resources to bale out the entire soviet union
yeah
you know the amazing thing about it is how these people who've been operating for you know seventy generations under a
you know the protectorate of the government over them that they really don't even have a concept of what capitalism is
and as a matter of fact i'm not a guy with my company was in moscow several weeks ago and i asked him what it was like and he said you know he said they start drinking vodka at ten o'clock in the morning
but anyway it's i don't know there just
they've got a really different outlook and a different mentality than people than have anybody that has been accustomed to living under any form of capitalism and it's going to take quite a while for them to realize that
oh i i'd well actually i did visit hawaii once but i never made it off of oahu which i've heard is not the nicest of the islands
uh-huh
oh that's wow yeah
french people to go and they speak french and so you know in that sense is just a little bit easier and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go and
so we didn't really have enough time we had about a little bit less than two weeks and as always it seems a bit rushed we do a lot of traveling around we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere
no in fact some of the days we froze it was well we were there in the winter in january or february i don't remember which uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's too bad because
yeah it was a very interesting vacation the only thing i didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas
the it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide and you there were some places where people there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off
and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in you know in jacket underneath a coat type of thing but
uh-huh
yeah
in the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide
it doesn't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you and it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
and you feel stupid doing that but we did it and we were much happier and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone
hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too my more exciting spots have been i've been to the galapagos islands
uh-huh that was one of the most wonderful vacations i've ever had yes if you like wildlife it's a fabulous vacation
and so i went to hawaii and then to australia
and japan and china
i actually i didn't go diving i i'm a diver and so that's actually been another of my
favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
but no i didn't get to the great barrier reef i drove from sidney down to melbourne and over to adelaide it's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous the coastline was just incredible it's huge
australia yeah but
i don't remember if i had shrimp
i don't think so
uh-huh and i was by myself in china too yeah
china was a little bit more of a challenge but it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time and so i never you know got out by myself or not much
no actually i paid about
either a thousand dollars or a little bit
no maybe it was about a thousand dollars maybe a little bit less i don't really remember for ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare and sorry but this is from hong kong
because i was already in hong kong and but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and i went to beijing
shanghai chengdu and actually then i took a train up from shanghai to a little quingdao i think is the name of it it's a little
sort of getaway retreat village not far from shanghai it's just a train ride and that i had two internal one yeah two internal plane flights
oh japan's ridiculous
and i stayed i didn't stay in the top of the line hotels but i stayed in they were all completely clean and you know they were newly built and
they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff
right
right
but yeah that was i highly recommend that way to go if you're ever interested in going the route i dealt with this woman her name was rita at china tours in boston
yeah and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to china and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun i think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver
and a guide and then
well i guess it's a subject i haven't thought too much about i don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools as much as we're expecting too much out of them
minnesota wisconsin
yeah
um-hum
yeah well it's it is getting very expensive to run schools so they got computers now that you got to train on there's just so much more
and less money to do it with
all right yeah
yeah i guess that in
talking on lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools i think they're
right yeah
yeah
yeah
i know when i was going to school it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving i mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job
yeah
right
yeah
seems a be a subject that i don't have much to say on
yeah
um-hum
yeah
right
right
yeah
decide on where the money's best spent i know
in lot of cases different districts like to have nice fancy schools
and maybe they should be a little more
concerned with paying the right people to teach and be satisfied with maybe a little older school
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
well know where i came from we didn't have a very
rich community and
high school that i went to was
very old and as far as i know it's still there they've expanded on it but they've never build a new one and it's probably fifty sixty years old or better
i don't foresee them building a new one for a long time because they can't afford it
-kay
wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh huh
well
i'm going to talk about when i was working as a teacher and when i was what i'm what i'm doing now when i was a teacher in utah
i would generally wear dresses and heels and things like that and
even when it rained and snowed i just braved it and i wore heels anyways because and
oh yeah well i need all the height i can get
oh yeah
oh
oh
uh-huh
yeah
oh well
yeah
the first two years i was in a room where they didn't heat it
yeah and the third year we got heating so
right uh-huh
oh that's nice
uh-huh oh nice well
no we moved to iowa and i'm working at a day care right now
and so the way i dress is really different because i'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months
yeah i wear tennis shoes and jeans and things that you know are sort of not
yeah if it doesn't matter if i have to wash it a hundred times or something
yeah but i never wore jeans because i thought that was too casual
for
yeah really
yeah that's how i feel too
we lived in utah before and i grew up in california
okay now what is your favorite tv show
well can't you find anything else to replace
so you don't watch northern exposure
oh okay you're having to be in reruns for that one have you seen brooklyn bridge
that is one of it's so clean and so laid back and i'm awful tired of
hm i'll fly away
yes yeah
i don't know it it's clean it there again you don't have the violence
and i'm surprised it's even still on because coming at seven o'clock in the evening that's when the children want to watch
and that is not part of it
so
oh
well i'm let's see i believe texas lost last night is that correct
well don't you ever forget that oklahoma is not bad but oklahoma
oklahoma state though is the better of the two so
that's right um-hum i'm a transplanted okie um-hum
well i have recently retired and i find that this is the most boring thing in the world is to sit and watch tv
oh you don't well
well
it's
do you work out of the home
oh
okay
i was an accountant at the medical school here for the food service
i know it and i think i think that's really sad because i think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else
eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again
um-hum
oh yeah that's yeah it it's sad
um-hum
uh-huh yeah i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life style than necessary
you know to i don't think you know the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and this type of thing i think that they would from the you know attention or whatever
but i
i don't know i see it as a major problem and i think it's going to have to swing back the other way because i think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this
um-hum
in richardson we're in plano here and i have a daughter in middle school and i know there aren't very many but she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home but do you see
you know do you do you ever see problems you know that you feel you know that the kids are left alone too much and
he stays at school and the school allows that
uh-huh
um-hum
oh my
um-hum
oh
um-hum
no mother to talk to
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
so what do you think about employers screening
you know job candidates for drug usage
right
right you think it infringes on personal rights to have that type of screening
but a lot of times people who are on drugs don't admit it
right yeah i don't really have that much a problem with drug screening i think
if it's gonna effect their job performance i think it's reasonable for an employer to request a drug test but
right
yeah it always should be mandatory for some positions such as those but
that's true that's true you there has to be that's the that's the key i think is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs you got to just that's when you have to be careful you know you just can't
fire every person something needs to be done to help these kind of these people
right they can go and
right there should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean themselves up and be given a second chance
um-hum
true
right
right
right yeah
that's true yeah
i don't know i'm thinking if from my perspective let's say you owned a business you would want to have the opportunity to screen any candidate for a job within your own company
and if you put yourself in that situation you don't want to hire someone who's on cocaine
no but i could it's something i may do eventually so from that perspective i can i'd see the need for drug testing
um-hum
right
well
right yeah you can't really do that you could be hiring someone for a managerial white collar position in your company and the person can appear very
well qualified and perfectly normal but they may be having a lot more problems
what kind of truck
oh i think that's pretty good i got to look for something too i unfortunately i have a ford thunderbird that
how did those work
how long did they last you they
how many miles you get on it
did you get a couple hundred thousand
really
hm
yeah
maybe that's the kind of car i better buy i drive too many miles i drive about thirty five thousand miles a year
and american cars i guess just don't do that kind of mileage
well i think the cars do i don't think they have mechanics that can fix them that's the whole problem
yep
well they can't fix it they don't they don't have the
no
yeah
you live in dallas well you got the same problem with mechanics i think they i just don't think there's good mechanics around
i think you're right
that's the problem i agree with you used to be you could you could repair and do all those things yourself and there's so much i think the antipollution stuff is what really fouls up a lot of engines
and there's no way you can work on them
yep that's right
i think they can it's just that
that's why the electric car has been made for some time but there's too much politics and too much
gas and oil people that will prevent that from coming on the market for the time being i'm afraid
yeah
then they bring it on board
well we can always go back to horses
you think they last a long time
unfortunately it's apparently the crime wave is not limited to cities you know it's spreading to you know our communities also and smaller
um-hum
i'm originally from a little rural town in southern oklahoma
yes
yes
that is
that's really scary it has it's done the same thing even in my little town and gosh it's only like a thousand people
there's one deputy sheriff that tries to you know patrol the whole thing and he's you know he's just overwhelmed
that's right
sure it's probably a safer environment for them
boy i who knows i don't know
are you talking about educationwise yeah
um-hum
that's right absolutely
um-hum yeah
yeah
you know as you know you watch the nightly news you know like i do and boy you know that's not a day or night that goes by in this in this area at least as somebody at least somebody doesn't get killed or raped or robbed during this
the jillion others we don't even hear about probably
um-hum
yes that's been a hot topic yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's right
that's right you never hear about
and you know some of the crimes are so crazy you know
just you know killing somebody for a five dollar bill or some stupid thing like you know you just you just never know you know it's i sometimes get concerned about you know driving down the down the street you know if you look crosswise at somebody they're liable to blow your head off
it's really scary
i don't know either
yeah it's obviously not getting any better
um-hum yes
um-hum
right um-hum and even down to the death penalty i think as far as you know appeal after appeal after appeal i think they've finally began to say you know enough's enough
yeah
that's right
yeah a lot of people favor you know mandatory jail time with no you know no good time off you know i don't know i don't know if that's an answer or not i'm not too sure people are really scared of jail time anymore because they're in and out so quickly
i'm not sure that's a real scary item for them
you know it's
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yes
yeah
right
you know this building jails you know more jails the answer i'm not sure it is i don't know i honestly don't know i wish i did i'd be glad to share it with everybody if i knew
yes
yeah
before they get to jail
yeah i agree
i don't know maybe you know maybe it needs to start at home you know with the parents as much as they can do you know parents can only do so much up to a point and they've lost it
um-hum right
that's right
i'll tell you the truth about both i have two children both of are you know young adults grown and gone away from home i'm honestly glad i'm not raising children at this point and time
yes
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
absolutely
yeah it's no guarantee
that's right
um-hum
that's right if you can help it that's key you know
that's right yep up to a point you after that you've lost it
sure have i'm just glad i'm not raising young children anymore
um-hum
yeah um-hum
um-hum
i'm not so sure
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's right
no maybe just a smaller just a smaller scale maybe but you know the idea is still the same it's there
it really is
i don't know like i say i'm just glad i'm not trying to have to raise small children again
um-hum
that's right not to mention monies spent
so i don't know wish i did
yeah i guess so
police i'm sure are just you know maxed out
there's only so much they can do
um-hum
yeah
no i don't either as a matter of fact i think they're doing you know probably for the most part the best job they can do with resources they have it's really must be discouraging though to know that you know you bust somebody for something they may be out on the street before you finish your report you know
that's got to be discouraging especially if you've risked your life to do course you know if you're a cop you expected to risk your life
that's right
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
as i understand it talking to a couple of my police friends what they fear most is a call to go try to settle a domestic quarrel you know apparently it's very dangerous you just never know
um-hum
that's right
apparently it's very dangerous situation
no i don't i don't think i could be a cop i really don't
nice to talk to you uh-huh bye-bye
oh
you know the ones who have dogs are very protective of them and i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets but they just
really take care of them are and are protective of them
yeah and like my kids they really want a dog badly
a kind of traveled around traveled
yeah when i had a cocker spaniel it was an outdoor dog and i think i liked that better uh-huh
yeah that's true
yeah that's true
take them for walks right
yeah i see all the people on sunday going for a walk with their dogs and
and i i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog i'm like i know it'll be fun the first week maybe and then mom gets to take care of it or something so i
um-hum
yeah
yeah i think it's really important to that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that you know we're not just
going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them that kind of gripes on me some but
right
but
i think that's really true
well i think that's all i have to say okay have a good night all right bye-bye
oh i see well that's neat uh-huh
so i've worked for them for several years like twelve now i guess
oh did you
no i haven't i have i have a hard time with movies that are real long i don't know
yeah
yeah
well i've heard a lot of good things about it
was it
we my wife and i went and saw a couple of funny ones we saw the naked gun two and a half
yeah that was that was pretty funny and then we saw
what was the spoof on top gun
it's
uh-huh
right have you seen ghost yet
i really i enjoyed that movie
really
uh-huh
oh yeah now yeah
yeah
um-hum
right
right
uh-huh
oh silence of the lambs yes i did yeah i really enjoyed that a lot
uh-huh
yeah well it's amazing but really i mean when you stop and think about it anthony perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie and yet it was his character that was so intriguing
yeah
yeah i do too i really do you know jodie foster was good too but i think i think anthony perkins was the one that really made the movie i agree with you
oh hopkins i'm sorry hopkins yeah i always get those guys mixed up
well i well i haven't been i'm i saw her in the accused and i thought that was a pretty good movie i thought she
that was that was a pretty interesting movie and but you know i did i really liked the silence of the lambs that was really intriguing and it didn't scare me all that much you know and i don't like to go to movies to be scared that's not why i go
so
right and that one was
oh he didn't see it oh
uh-huh
oh really yeah i've seen it
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah i've seen that it's pretty it's pretty cute i guess you know as far as comedies go probably my favorite is young frankenstein i don't know i love that movie
yeah so
yeah gene wilder doesn't do that much for me but i'm a big mel brooks fan all his movies i really enjoy
he does
oh blazing saddles yeah uh-huh
oh uh-huh i like i like that one too but i thought young frankenstein was better yeah that was just you know had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie i just really enjoyed it
and i'm trying to think because we saw another one that we thought was really good early this summer that was a suspenseful movie
i'm trying to remember what it was
because it you know it's
excuse me
yeah that's what i think too i don't know how you feel we moved here from another state we've lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax
and what you find out is there's one evil's the same as the other here you don't there's no occupational tax but it's a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going
yeah its really i know it's just
yeah it is i was shocked i went we bought a new washer and the man said and that's eight percent i said eight percent what so it's really kind of sad yeah
and then i don't know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal but it just seems like if you're strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst
is that what you think
um-hum
doesn't seem quite fair does it because they have the money to shelter things and i don't know somehow get a huh
oh i thought you were going to say something they somehow seem to get around the things that we can't you know that make don't make that kind of money
i don't know
um-hum i know and just somehow it doesn't seem you know and they're you mean you look at somebody like that country singer what's his name willie nelson
i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money he didn't look that stupid why didn't he pay his taxes you know
in a way it's almost like he had so much debt that filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know so
do you file federal or a joint income tax or do you
and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much
um-hum and we right now we don't own any property we lease so we're in the we don't have children so we're in the same kind of it's not as bad as being single and divorced but it's sort of like if you have like x point five children and own you know
you kind of get hit with you know i mean it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage because and that sounds stupid but i mean there's actually less tax implication if i don't work full time compared to what my husband does you know
so it's kind of hard
excuse me
uh-huh
right yeah otherwise you're just you know and if you have kids you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something
oh it is oh my well that's not too bad
uh-huh
oh my goodness
can you give me your ideas on what you think about the budget
and massachusetts had the same type of legislation you know they only can raise taxes so much there there's a cap on it
you don't have a state income tax
is that right
yeah our sales tax isn't either it's a
yeah it's just they're just running
i don't know about texas but i know up around here as soon as like massachusetts well rhode island too it doesn't make any difference which state when things get tight they always
it's the rank and file they never talk about cutting at the top you know the administrators and the assistant to the assistant to the assistant
and i think the federal government is the same way that it's just gotten so huge that i don't think anyone
has got a handle on it anymore
huh
that's right that's true yeah
yeah
and that's if you know because some of these old boys have been in there for a thousand years
yep
yep
yeah it's probably going to have to start there and get some new blood in there and then
maybe they can look at it and they can you know each one of them that's in there now have got their own favorite projects and all you know they're cronies and
yeah
oh i see
massachusetts is in is in terrible shape
they're still talking about
laying off a lot of people you know cutting a lot of services the state is not funding any of the any of the cities and towns so
so the cities and towns now are forced to go out and raise capital it's
it's just a bad situation and it's not only there but rhode island is the same it's just isn't there you know it's in the same boat
yeah you know there's an awful lot of people in this country that are idle when you say like the homeless and there's the prison population is skyrocketing
i think they should probably go back and borrow some of roosevelt's ideas you know set up some of these ccc camps like they had way back
that
that's right they could they could they could build roads bridges canals there's a ton of things they can do we can take in they could stop start a rapid transit
movement like when they when they first broke into
we don't have a rapid transit system in this country though worth a worth a damn
that's right because i don't know what it costs per year per inmate
but
if they just if they just like paid them a wage and let them perform something useful
do you have any special menus that you like to use when you're entertaining
yes but we dream
we dream though
yes
well
are you a traditional cook
um-hum
yeah
i do to
sure
then you can
oh yes
yes
yeah i have a son-in-law who is a wonderful cook and my daughter reads cookbooks and he cooks but for the last few years i have
had something different for him every holiday
i think one of them came out of the martha stewart cookbook
you're familiar with martha stewart her all of her culinary delights and it was it wasn't all that you know yummy and it wasn't a lot to eat but it was interesting caramelized onions
and you cut them in half and turn them over with the you know don't peel them or anything and turn them over with the cut side down and you bake them like two hours and a half on about two seventy five or something like that
and then when you know until they're kind of well not really burned they call them caramelized and then
you mix up this little mixture of cranberries and sugar and a few nuts and
a little bit of liquid and then you bake that for about thirty minutes and then you it's just a really pretty condiment actually
and so then you just eat the insides you know the few layers of onions that didn't get hard or anything and then that filling but that was interesting and another interesting one that he liked so well was
turnips i've always had a neighbor or two that wanted to bring me turnips well who not many people like turnips
but i did
a casserole using half turnips half potatoes
swiss cheese milk and butter
and just baked them and it is absolutely wonderful
if and the secret is using half potatoes
and that swiss
oh i do too oh especially so many people like them to dip in vegetable dip too i think
uh-huh
no well i'm glad to hear about that
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i'll be and you've eaten them
do you know when i was growing up
my mother wouldn't let us eat raw sweet potatoes she said they were poison
so we just you know raw potatoes yes if she was peeling potato and we were you know she'd we'd want a piece and but she wouldn't never let us so i suppose that is a myth isn't it
yes
yeah
you're still alive and kicking
no and it is colorful too
well i have spent the last twenty years in oklahoma
and so i've had a wonderful time with mexican type dishes the santa fe influence as well as the tex-mex and i have so many wonderful recipes and
my family here i we're originally from this part of country and
if i do any of those casseroles especially they will say this is sort of spicy
uh-huh
yes
um-hum
finally the taco bell started springing up
yeah
um-hum
yeah they really don't my friends and relatives really don't like it very well
uh-huh well it
really
bye-bye
well tell me about you said your daughter had some of this why don't you tell me a little bit about that
oh my isn't that interesting
um-hum
yeah
right
no in fact very bad i think that is the thing that it scares everybody to death because
right
um-hum
i think maybe when you talk about the criteria that's the one thing is to is to somehow get to know well enough what where you're putting this child
and if you know your child well then you know whether this is going to work sometimes some of these things work out well interesting enough my daughter
just started working in a day care center she needed to go to work and she has two little boys one's about
almost five and the other's almost three and
they were driving her crazy i guess they were never busy enough you know she couldn't ever do enough things to keep them away from the television and that sort of thing
and so but she looked at places to work for a long time before she finally chose one that she said she could she could not have been comfortable in any of the others because this one's kind of laid back a little bit you know
it kind of flows with the children like her children play in another area but they're welcome to come and sit on her lap anytime they feel like it
and she can go by and wave at them you know and talk to them and visit with them and she gets this feeling of intermingling with them and yet they get the activity of the other children which they seem to need at this point
uh-huh
yes there's a lot of times when you need some of that but the idea of having nothing else is what's unfortunate yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
no that's right sometimes
yeah it's very difficult costs so much that you can't hardly afford to work even though you have to yeah
yeah
and in some ways rightly so you know it's a sad thing that
that you realize the child care if it's done right
is probably the most demanding job in the world and if they really are good at it you're probably not paying them any too much
and yet and yet it's you can't get something else to do i guess that's probably the reason sheila felt like going that direction i had a
niece that stayed here too that they were here for about six months with their two little girls and
she took in children here at my house while she was here you know not many like three others and we have a big house so it wasn't a problem and she
but it was kind of an it was interesting watching her you know her interaction with the children she didn't do anything else all day she just
sat and played and intermingled with them you know and read to them and change their pants and fed them and moved them from one thing to another
but that's what you do you just
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
that's true that's true
i think so too i think that's the answer
i think it's got to come through the work place where they where a parent can take a child and maybe even have an area an isolation area where children who are ill can be there
and you know if there not too ill and a parent can go and do her work and there is somebody there that can do it
think of how many jobs they would supply people who are not trained to do other kinds of things and with the right kind of supervision you know if you had somebody who really knows what she's doing supervise other people
you could really go a long ways to alleviating some of the problems that people have
yeah so well it's been great talking to you
right
right bye-bye now uh-huh
okay what are the benefits well i mean i don't even consider like salary a real benefit it just it's kind of a like a side thing i'm really here for you know working with lots of creative people
is what i really like about my job
um-hum
you know if you're worried you don't work as well
i know
and it just gets worse then people don't spend any money
right yeah i just noticed that yeah
that's true
i know i mean our ceo is you know quite frankly stated that you know we're here to make stockholders happy
yeah it's things aren't that secure in software right now either i think it's
it's kind of a cutthroat i'm also a i'm also a hardware manufacturer i'm at apple so it's like
you know we notice our product just becoming a commodity and that's really bad
we're trying and if it works that'd be great for us but what about you know the rest of the industry
yeah although we go on that subject i because i looked at hdtv but i don't like standards that are on it's still on a fixed resolution which means it'll be eventually outdated also
um-hum
everybody's separate
okay this is really ironic that this would
no this is the first time he's gotten out before but he's always stayed right here you know he's never gone away and so this is just really strange you know because
and yeah he's pretty big that's why it really surprises me you know that
he hasn't come back because like i said he's never gone away like this before and
that isn't that funny how we do i mean we just really
yeah well they're companions you know they're really well do you have any
oh yeah that's what are so neat about animals i mean they are you know like i said they're really companions you know and they're friends you know i mean they
but he's always been right there he's never been gone from at all you know he's just always been right there when he gets out you know it's the first time he's ever been gone like this
i just knew today you know we looked at the pound and
yeah we keep you know they told us like at the humane society and the adoption center you know don't give up hope you know and then
well not yet we were talking about that tonight since you know he we just he just got out yesterday we were just talking about that whether we
we were trying to find some pictures of him recently we've got so many when he was a puppy
so i don't know i we will probably will put some things up some posters and stuff up
and hopefully that will help you know and maybe around the neighborhood but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood so that helps too you know if they can keep yeah
so i think that if somebody else picks him up i think that if he gets out he'll come back you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives so
nope
well that's good that's one thing about cats though they're so small and you know they can get hurt a lot easier you know and then so that would make you really tend to worry about them you know if they're not right there
is that right
huh
yeah that's true i like the way they come up and they'll
they'll put their head underneath your hand you know it's that and most dogs do that i mean i don't know any that really don't i mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know they just
well no well he's outside during the day and then when we get home at night we do bring him in
but
he dug a hole under the fence well see he did he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole and you know we filled it back up
we got we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it
you know so that he couldn't get out well he kind of ripped through the chicken wire so i can't i just have not
i don't understand you know because it's like he's got a good home you know he's got i mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot you know it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out you know we just couldn't
bothers me the most about it you know it's like
well
i don't know at first you know they seemed to be upset but now it's like
well if he doesn't come home can we get another dog it's like wait a minute you know
yeah it
oh
i didn't know that
i had i had no idea i did not know that
the biggest social change that i've seen in the last ten years
is that i you know i'm only twenty four twenty five right just turned twenty five and ten years ago i can remember when it was not common to see two people in a family or household working
and getting behind and running into economic problems the way things are today
you know today just to get by in many cases you have to have two people working in the middle income house just to stay with where they were in the seventies
and it's really rough that's probably the biggest thing i've noticed
yeah
yeah
i remember when we were going to the grocery store when i was younger those big monstrosity cash register
yeah
yeah i found all through school you know you write your hand to death you go through pens and i'm actually because i have two computers here
i'm actually loosing the ability to write by hand and feel comfortable doing it
it's too slow i think the speed of the i think much faster because i can type much faster than i can actually write now
and i what happens is words will drop out of writing and i'll go back because i'm thinking so i'm thinking at the speed that i type on the computer
it's incredible you know i remember i started on a commodore sixty four in ninety eighty six that was my first computer
and today i'm on a three eight six thirty three and it's too slow you know i can't wait
it's got to go faster you know
hum
oh yeah up here
and you can't rely on that kind of thing anymore everything sped up so fast and there's no more old-fashioned reliability in things anymore the way the pace has changed
um-hum
from the cwa the union there and they're letting people go like crazy it's just it they're replacing them with computers
advice on son or daughter going to college that's advice that i will need in time future for my children rather than the one that i have personal experience with
i suppose
i would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet those needs
okay
um-hum
what advice would you give
i guess
one clear cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus
stay in a dormitory if you can go to classes talk to faculty members and students
yes i'm thinking what problems my children might have with that but i agree with you
what is
yeah
well course realism is it is a big factor in
having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and you're willingness one to work during the summer or part time and two
to take out loans to assume debt after college
yes
um-hum
see mine is twelve
that's my gut feeling too i my son is certainly not persuaded of that
hello oh yeah
yes i didn't have a car at college i mean think it's more an a burden to provide for it
i didn't do any of those although i feel less strongly about tv's and refrigerators
what do you do artistic painting
oh you do
do you do a lot of it
yeah i took one class about i guess three or four years ago and i've done a little
do you sell your projects
uh-huh
um-hum
now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique
uh-huh
uh-huh have you tried any of the well do you cut out your own projects
huh
do you ever spray your projects with i mean a base coat first or do you brush it all on
uh-huh
i just bought a spray gun one of those airless not airless high volume low pressure spray guns
and i do a lot of wood working and that's what i bought it for
but i haven't used it yet
yeah
fine furniture type stuff yeah
that's why i brought bought the sprayer is to finish my projects that's my worst
worst part of my wood working i get so sick of making it
yeah
but spraying does put on a nicer finish
for wood working let me see table saw scroll saw band saw lathe routers and that's about it
yeah it is
but yeah it's nice to have the right equipment
um-hum
not mostly i do like you do give it away as gifts
making my own furniture
just in junior high and then i just kept on through high school and then bought my own equipment
kept up with that
yeah
like the shelves and
good
well i guess i'll let you go now
oh they do
uh-huh
yeah sounds fun where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here
oh i'm not well we live in roy but we haven't is it on nineteen hundred
i know where fifty six hundred south is
are you
oh you like country western
yeah
yeah we've i mean it you know there's you have all sorts here too
i went to a pretty
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
oh really
that's fun
well what you mentioned alternative music
um-hum
you said you're also a performer
what do you perform
oh wow
yeah
yeah
joe scruggs is a guy that is out of austin here that has some wonderful kids tapes it's i mean they are really fun and joe scruggs he's with he's an educational
yeah
uh-huh
oh
if they're big up there in fact i think they may have even had a television show on saturday mornings for kids
they're pretty neat they're kind of a blue grass country they're real fun i mean they're
they're the guys that i mean they can yodel and they can they play the fiddles and the and the saws and stuff and they're real fun they're a real fun group
yeah
yeah well yeah
well we saw them originally at a at a club down here probably about oh seven or eight years ago and
what we saw in the you know was adult in the but i don't know i don't know where they run the gamut and i don't know
uh-huh
they tell you what our topic was
you bet
i'm fifty years old i've been a hacker i think i think i played better golf when i was fifteen john -an i play right now
and
oh i know it's just unreal i you know i'm a guy that plays
if i play a lot of golf i play six to eight times a year
and that's about it i figure that's my retirement game i really
i come from a family of golfers i mean i was raised by a man my stepfather who with a two handicap i mean he could get down on his knees and hit the ball
i mean further -an most people could hit it and my mother who's now he's my stepfather is dead but my mother who's now
seventy one i can remember her being i believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap but all they did everyday in their life was
play golf every minute leave work and go to a golf course or a little country club they belonged to back in richmond virginia and just play nine holes of golf that was their deal but
but i just i just never could do it i have a brother in law who is an ex college coach and like a pro and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf sort of like the non golfer of the family
oh really yeah
yeah
i think i'm probably the same way lessons do help i know every year
we buy i go to this ducks unlimited dinner it's a hunter's type affair and i buy in austin texas i go down to austin i live in the dallas area but i go down to austin and go with my good customer friend of mine
and we always buy this weekend
at a at a country club in the hill country
and we at horseshoe bay and we just have a ball and we play
three days in a row three different courses and course believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the third course my score has gone from you know a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five
so
you bet so it
that makes a lot of difference to me
you bet
yep that's super i haven't learned to hit the ball easy yet i just sort of
i'm always wanting to hit it hard and that's something my stepfather never could teach me you know just to relax and hit the ball and you know so subsequently when i do tire out from playing like
twelve fourteen holes and i you know and a lot of my energy's gone and i do swing it's an easier swing and i do actually hit the ball better
no i have a two through you know two through wedge i hit a two iron awful lot off now
off the tee i don't hit a driver off the tee now that that's why i need my driving lessons
that helps
well that's a good idea i think this next year i'm gonna i'm gonna attempt to play more and i'm gonna do the same thing i laid off my woods about three years ago and i just use a two wood off the fairway and
i'm a fairly strong person so i get a pretty good little drive when i hit and i guess control my irons better you know if you go take lessons the first thing they put in your hand's an iron
and i sort of remembered that watching myself and my son
so but i think the key is just need to you need to play more often than i play
right
makes
yeah makes good makes good sense
oh yeah
you bet
sort of straight i just wanna get down and kiss the ground you know
okay
well i think the idea of public health services is a good one i think that we all
perhaps have a civic duty but i don't know as though it should be and i don't know if this was my interpretation was that perhaps it should be like a forced thing
i think it should all be voluntary as it is now but i do agree that i think it is a good thing because i don't know how else a lot of these things could happen if they didn't have the volunteers to do it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
well that's true and of course there was the need there and they didn't have any other resource and i guess it served it's purpose
right is that what it was meant to do but as you say they were paid and i'm not all that familiar with the peace corps although i have friends who have family members that are in it and
they generally go abroad and serve but they don't get a salary and they give up x number of years of their lives to do this
i know some people that just came back from south america and they are degreed and once they got their degrees they're a married couple and they went off they got they got some compensation but it wasn't a whole lot
yeah more like a sabbatical i would imagine and i guess a lot of it was a learning experience for them i imagine it takes just different kinds of people
and now they're back in school so maybe they're people in the beginning that just want to
be in a constant learning environment i don't know
but
yes i agree i so many of our things are going outside the country to benefit other nations and okay that's fine but what about here
you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i'll be
you know maybe we've got a turn around here maybe in the beginning we thought it wasn't such a good idea but perhaps if we instrumented it here in the us
rather than taking all that manpower out of the us and providing a service for people to join here and do some good we could come up with some of those things
um-hum
right
um-hum
that's a good thought now see i hadn't thought about it that way my first thought was when they mentioned that was to people who go abroad and do service abroad
and perhaps there might be as you say more of an effort here needed
yes that's true
um-hum
yes
i agree it doesn't always work that way the way it was intended and then the people change in this country too and not and are not able to see it through our administration changes also
so
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i think i'm inclined
but it's been interesting it's been an interesting soapbox
so
um-hum
now i thought that was just a sign of the times we're all stressed out that's what they're trying to tell us that we now get upset because we have to wait in line or wait in traffic but in reality there's so much more traffic and so many more lines and
really like you say something needs to be done about that too
um-hum
um-hum
apparently if we could get like we were discussing some people involved in this country like they want to be involved in other countries maybe we could do some real good here
you know and not take so long to do it
i think it could happen
that's very true
or put these people that are in prison
you know
that's very true
yes exactly
um-hum
um-hum
and supposedly we're reeducating them and putting them back out in the public so give them some public service
i don't know i suppose to somebody's way of thinking we are but i know that when they do get out the majority of them aren't able to find jobs are they or get back into society because they have that stigmatism
um-hum
that's very true if you had a public health organization in the us that took and say a lot of the
so how do you like the benefits of ti
oh that's right yeah
yeah that's one problem with engineering jobs is
it's you really need some sort of more flexible or portable pension you know something more like a
either well i guess you get part of into 401k one oh 401k
but what is the key plan that people who are privately employed use
right
um-hum
yeah
what also seems like a lot of company set the benefits based on
your last salary when you left the company
so you know let's say you've worked there for twenty years
you stopped working there you go work for somebody else for fifteen years and because of inflation alone
you know your twenty years is worthless just because it's not an index to fund it's based on the actual dollar amount of when you worked there
yeah
benefits in general
um-hum
well that's one thing you do get with a large company they're
you know it's well it's actually can go both ways some ways you have
more opportunities because there're so many things going on within the company
but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on this type project
and that i guess to some extent depends on the philosophy of the company and whether they pigeon hole people or allow people to go in to any area they want to
yeah there was some clicking on the line i'm not sure what
whether that's local or somewhere in the long distance network between
new jersey and wherever you are
california okay
this is also possible
somewhere between texas
um-hum
well it depends on where you go if you go up far enough north it doesn't
it gets cheaper again but then again there's
um-hum
yeah i know new jersey is
just slightly above the national average which was yeah it's about twice the price of atlanta
but the housing prices have definitely dropped
yeah cost of living cost of housing is the salary enough to allow me to do the activities i want to do
oh
hum
yeah
hm
oh that's interesting
i went to a liberal arts school actually at first and you weren't really even
they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were
in your second year and then you know you had i think you had to pick it by the by the by the end of second you had to pick some sort of major but until then they didn't sort of force you they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then
certain requirements so that so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything
so it wasn't that specialized so that
yeah
yes
um-hum i was just on a committee recently actually sponsored by the american association for the advancement of science trying to sort of you know where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know
because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts and then the other way around as well people are getting just pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues so
um-hum
well that must be helpful
yeah well i figure that that's probably the thing that i would most tell any parent you know to tell their kids i think probably make sure the kid goes to a school where they can get sort of a general education and
save specialization i guess for graduate school unless they're sure they want early on they want to do something like engineering or something or they can
hum
yeah but that's a good idea well where i am right now actually i'm at the university of rochester
and that's a pretty good engineering school i think i think we do some they have a pretty good engineering here they also have a fairly large liberal arts college as well a sort of a separate you know arts and sciences college
and i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in everything and i know people i do i do work in language processing and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer
right
um-hum
yes
um-hum
hum
um-hum
that would be very good actually
right you don't need any philosophy at all in school
um-hum
or yeah or some other thought provoking area you know very true we had when i went to undergraduate we had
went to brandeis don't know if you know of it or not we had a requirement freshman year of just humanities then you were given a choice of
you know there were ten or twelve or whatever or fifteen different courses that you could take but they all centered they all came out of philosophy english and literature departments and they were
they were they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read you know for so the first year humanities courses everyone had to read the iliad and so forth and what they did though was they all approached it from
from very different you know so they had you could have one class in the philosophy of something that the philosophy of greek mythology or something that actually approached this or
one literature you know or a literature course or just all sorts of different perspectives on it and people got to
pick and choose but by the end everyone had a good sample of sort of how to think about these things non scientifically you know and
and that sort of forced them but i believe that you one of the one of the best things to do at least for me in school was i was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses
i was forced to take i think you know some sort of art history course
and we all grumbled about it at first but then afterward we all wound up taking extra art history classes because it just seemed like something we didn't totally know nothing about but just enjoyed very much doing and something i never would have done if i if i wasn't forced to take it
hum
yes um-hum and that and that really is something that i notice like i talk to a lot of my friends at schools that are more specialized and they don't have that
they just you know they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take and that was all they never had some of the more fun classes i guess
yes i'm hoping i'm hoping
yes i graduated college in eighty seven and i just went straight through
because i just don't have the time anymore to sort of sit in a course
that i'm not getting graded for whereas before i would just sign up for credit for it now i can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily
so i have to try and go myself and i went for like two or three weeks and realized not enough time for the work unfortunately
i'm pursuing a doctorate in psychology so i'm just
wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead
oh
um-hum
hum so you had real world experience in the middle there
and that helped you think
or that was
um-hum
hum yeah i'm getting some of that i have i have sort of some work experience yet my wife is not an academic at all
she works in something i she works for a temporary agency and i and i never would have had she's the office supervisor i never would have had any i've learned much just sort of by watching her and her and her business as well so yeah so i can see where that might be a
that's my oh yeah
yes
um-hum
okay
um-hum
i like to do like physical things like sports
i really enjoy softball and my favorite is volleyball
and but i'm at school i'm in you know i live up at the college
so sometimes it's hard for me to do that so i just like sometimes i like just to get away i go to my room and i like walk in turn the radio on or you know just kind of like veg out or something
um-hum
um-hum
i like to do that stuff but when i'm in like when i'm at school i don't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it
yeah
uh-huh
yeah exactly uh-huh like well i have i come from a family of twelve children and
when i'm up here i really miss my younger brothers and sisters so you know that's a change because there's nine of them that are younger than me
yeah well i'm not much of a basketball fan either
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
not that i like reading but i do a lot of reading while i'm here at school
do you like reading as a hobby
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah
do you i know one thing that's pretty popular with the girls up here at college and i make them also is the padded covered photo albums
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh i know they're real popular here at school also
um-hum
yeah i really don't have any other
uh-huh
it was nice talking to you too thanks bye
all right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
how fine
oh boy
uh-huh
oh really
hm
wow
hum
well we just moved to our first home and we had lived in a condominium before so
we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties so we're just learning the ropes here and
but when we moved in our backyard has so many big tall trees in it that there just there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard
so we're you know going talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass we trying to go grow grass and it just seems so funny to me
that when i grew up in missouri and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there it just happened automatically
so
yes we are we tried we planted some fescue last fall
and
and it's pretty it's not as thick and as nice it doesn't look like it can withstand too much you know
it's supposed to die off like in august and then you replant it in september
and
so but we don't the saint augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't like i say there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard
and
so mostly you know we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers and flower beds or even gardens that
we're just saying let's get some grass
let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much you know
uh-huh
oh yeah
oh no
on its own
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum
yes and
it's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful lush green lawn and we never there was no such thing as watering your lawns in missouri i mean it just happened
and so it's been real fun here to see there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies and a lot of people
we live in north of dallas and
plano
uh-huh up north and
and so there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the dallas area and big market for
for yards yard work
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes they do i noticed that they're really putting in small back yards because they have these most of the houses have the alleys that run behind
and so that really cuts into your backyard space and
but we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much just
right now we're just this is we just moved in september so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
hm
uh-huh
grass
oh
or what it was
well we're going to have to do that because we have the shade the trees this is an established and older home that we moved into and
the trees are just so tall and there must be what ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that
like even if its raining you can go out in our back yard and not get wet
well that's what we're looking forward to and that's what they say the payoff is but
too hot yes
well there are all different kinds there
you know there are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees
there are some big
big tall oak trees one across
i guess i look at getting the best deal
as my main objectives normally
whoever is willing to deal and give me a good price
um-hum
yeah
i don't know i've had pretty good luck you know even if you take any car and you care for it well enough you're gonna get some good life out of it
i my oldsmobile right now that i have is getting near eighty thousand and still in
pretty good shape there was a flaw in there where a where a head gasket bolt broke
and it cost me some bucks to fix that but that was you know something that
was unforeseen
but i still think i i'm gonna get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it
well i drive like the song says the little old lady but not from pasadena
but yeah i baby them ah as much as i possibly can
it's a pretty big expense nowadays
and i guess i like to take care of it so i don't have to buy one
too often
yeah i got an old seventy six grand fury that doesn't wanna die on me so i just keep running the thing
don't wanna sell it or get rid of it until it quits but it just doesn't seem to want to
it's got the big three sixty in there gas guzzler but
it runs good
yeah
yeah
yeah well i'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for
the next vehicle i just have so many hauling projects a lot of times and
i'd like to just start doing some
carpentry type work around and
i just feel
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh great
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i think you're i think you're earlier than we are as a rule aren't you your growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours
uh-huh see that is quite a bit we are just beginning people are have got their gardens in a lot of them now we could still have a frost
um-hum probably not but we have had we have had a frost as late as in june
uh-huh we could use a little more rain
i believe
um-hum
yeah if it could just be spread out a little bit uh-huh yeah it's really been nice here
we're supposed to have some rain this weekend but i don't know if we'll get it or not a lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us
yes um-hum we have
um-hum
oh yeah they get burnt off
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah well and that makes it bad too because when more with water being at a premium
i know our aunt in california they they've really been rationed on their water and it makes it real hard to have a yard or anything like that a their garden their farms their farmers i guess are hurting because of that also
yeah
yeah well they are not allowed to water so what do you do yeah
uh-huh
um-hum but your humidity is different though than ours i think and it makes a
a bit of a difference too
oh
i don't know i think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in texas i could be wrong
um-hum
well there is a lake not far but it is more run off from surrounding you know areas and that
and he's just in an area where it is just low enough that it's you know it collects there and he has had a couple of inches in his house several times
um-hum
um-hum because of that um-hum
we are fortunate or we are on a
yeah it is an old farm house and we really like it here
uh-huh
uh-huh it is nice down there i liked it when we visited there
right
right that is the best time to go yeah and usually it has been when we have gone it has been nice it has been hot but it is it is hot to me in the wintertime down there
oh really
oh
yeah it takes me about four and a half hours to do to mow our grass and i try to cover up when i do the lawn
uh-huh
is that right it just makes your skin more leathery it yeah so
um-hum well the elasticity of your skin the collagen or whatever they call it they say it destroys a lot of that and you lose a lot of that so
yeah but we have really had nice the weather i can't complain we have really had really good weather of late and when it has rained it it's been a good soaking rain and
it's just been a really nice spring
oh
oh that's great how long will they be there
uh-huh well that is great well i hope the weather stays real good for them and that you have a good visit and everything and i hope your garden does good
and so okay well it was really nice talking to you and
great okay bye-bye
oh
okay what kind of music are you interested in
uh-huh
uh-huh
so
oh
uh-huh
oh so
uh-huh oh i
well
and i like also like the you know the religious type christmas songs and i just love the music this time of the year and i also
do you
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
oh that's good
uh-huh yeah so that's
that's good i
for your favorite
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah so did you do you listen to your music loud do you like it loud or
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i like a lot of contemporary music i like all kinds of music i even like classical i have that playing you know once in a while in the background here at home and
enjoy that so do you go to concerts or
um-hum
um-hum
oh
oh
uh-huh
oh
oh wow
well that's nice
oh really
uh-huh
yeah
oh huh
yeah
no not for them
that's right do you play a musical instrument
oh
you haven't kept that up
uh-huh oh well that's good i played piano a little bit and i
i do too i do too i think it's really powerful it can make a lot of lot of strong statements
trying to i hope my kids will be interested in i'd love for them to play in a marching band i like the music from marching bands you know in parades
as they're going by i enjoy the drums and the trumpets and all that kind of stuff so i guess i like all most all kinds of music and
oh did he
oh
oh
well that's interesting i've never heard a drum corp in person had did you hear any of hear him play at all or
oh
the question is concerning the changes in the roles of american women in the past several generations and you know the in their in the society we live in what do you think has occurred there
um-hum but are they being given the full honor for the work they're doing and for the
oh my gosh can't think of the word but for the what they have to accept well that's that they're responsible for it responsibilities is what i'm trying to say
uh-huh
by the same token most in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who been there before but at lower salaries is that right wrong
is that
yes
um-hum
yeah what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years
any individual thing or is it just a general switch over
um-hum
i have a feeling that biness with a woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband
sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship in that
the lady
wants to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has every right to do so and this upsets the man because we've always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household
so do you think that is gonna be difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years
um-hum
well do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation specifically
um-hum
um-hum
yes
well i actually lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can be brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they're gonna get
and the people well how do you feel about women in armed services
yeah
yeah i somehow can't do that i was brought up in the ages when the ladies were kept home safe secure and made happy and the men went out and took the responsibility of earning the money
bringing in whatever they needed and protecting the household and it and it really still bothers me and i spent plenty of years in the service
but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there's two or three of them there and five hundred men around them and how are they gonna protect themselves so to speak
it puts them in a very bad situation i really don't go for that
um-hum
yep
well that's not fair because i can tell you one thing stay home sometime and start
doing some of those jobs that she's been handling and you're gonna learn there's a lot of responsibility in just keeping a home going
yeah
yeah
strong feelings on schools
i've
heard the that proposed before and i'm not discounting it completely but
the counter argument to that is that there are schools around that are
private schools not necessarily parochial schools where the teachers are paid no more than they are in the public schools and they and their track records are much better
the
in fact
catholic and other parochial schools around that are not staffed by nuns and i'm not a catholic so but i was just reading about this and what they were the
the argument that i've heard is that and i subscribe to some of it by the way
that
our schools are reflecting the same kind of mismanagement that lead to the demise of the soviet union and that is when you've got an absolute monopoly
and you can't you know it's a one party system so to speak then what you're going to have is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares
and reality is just not a market base system and i know i've been in the orient for about three years and
the public schools are not very good but the all of the good schools are private schools over there
and it's not that we're spending i think that we're spending a lot of money relatively speaking on schools
but
as with other things you know it like detroit or some of the other problems with it's not the worker it's the it's the management
and management frankly just doesn't have to they don't have to compete these days
yes
yeah
yeah and well i see that as a as what i consider the biggest problem
as with
with oh there are other problems and number one it would be nice if teachers got paid i hate to see the
how shall i say it the garbage the guys that collect garbage and
i hate to see those guys get paid more than teachers
and different teachers are under a lot more stress
and don't get any tips at the end of the day at you know at christmas time
so from that and frankly the private school systems
including colleges and things like that do quite well because there is a lot of competition
and if somebody decides that they're going if their decisions are out of step with reality pretty soon people don't stop going there
and
or they get a horrible reputation and they get this what do they call that
regarding health care it's funny because i have a sister who lives in europe and in europe that's the way it is health care is just
right exactly and the interesting thing is that it seems that they don't even think about it
it's not anything that seems to be you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's done and accepted
well i think the government subsidizes most of it but i believe that again just people are taxed
a little bit more but it's just interesting how something you know that we consider just such a major issue is just in such working order there
you know what do you feel about it
yes
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
the twenty percent
and the sad part is that people to you know combat this they just won't go to the doctor or they won't fill their prescriptions
i mean that you know that's the alternative
um-hum
i know
um-hum
um-hum
oh i know i know oh yeah it's true and i don't think that burden should be put on companies either i don't think that they should have to assume the responsibility of paying for the person's health care
oh yeah um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh you did
wow
um-hum
um-hum
i know well and well you know you're not the only one though i'm in a situation where when i started my job they were paying full benefits
i thought great you know can't get any better and then slowly each year you know now they're down to seventy five percent and then they went down to fifty percent and i understand they have to do that with the prices going up and up
but you just might as well knock of a couple thousand dollars from your salary you know to pay for this medical care and then i don't have kids so i'm not worrying about family coverage
but once you get into family coverage it's crazy
it's just crazy
yes
um-hum
right they have a hundred dollars to spend in december i know what you mean
yeah we do that too we're fortunate though this year somehow how it's only march and we've already used up our entire amount i don't know if that's good or bad
i don't know
i think it covers a portion because like i said my sister lives over there and they just they just never have to worry about it i think it might not cover full dental but it does cover some and again it covers you know
major things it won't cover cosmetic type things you know if you choose to do something but it's just like all in it's just all in practice it's all in plan i think that we could learn from that
i don't know i really don't know i know that they do equally as well there as they do here i mean doctors still have that same status
i don't know but it would be great and if only i mean
health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're not you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills
you know they're going to work every day because they're not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now
yeah
um-hum
um-hum well at least let them start off gradually you know fine so they won't jump into paying full health care let them pay you know partial and each year just you know let's increase it from there
i don't know but
um-hum
it'll take a while maybe our grandchildren will know it
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
it's what
oh i know like i said everyone's been in from texas all righty well take care okay bye-bye
i don't have a family budget but we do have a budget already
we're paying for our own wedding and everything
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and my parents also have been married for twenty five years and i kind of picked up what they do they really don't have a formal budget like you do
and they just pretty much know how much they have coming in you know and they just make sure they don't buy over
and i'm pretty much like that also i don't buy a lot of luxury items i buy what i need and i buy it when it's on sale
you know and i don't go out of the way but my fiancee now he has a set budget that he goes by and he allots so much to each thing and it works out good for him but
i think whenever like for the wedding we're doing this you know the wedding money we're doing together
and we've actually sat down and wrote out how much everything's going to cost and you know making sure we have enough for everything and going from there
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh well see well like i said he does he's with computer work and i'm a finance manager
but
we decided that we would kind of share like the books you know
he doesn't like the idea that i would just do all of it and i don't mind you know him helping with it either i think it's just pretty much going to be i think most couples you know it's not
it's not like one person doesn't know what's in there at any time you know
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well he's been on his own for probably oh it's been four years now
like i well my i came from a family we my mom had twelve children
and my dad didn't start out as a out as with a high paying job you know so she cut pennies wherever she could
you know and i i've learned that from her and it's really helping out now because in the you know
in the in a matter of a year and a half we've been managed to save it's going to be almost enough to pay for our entire wedding you know and we're talking five or six thousand dollars saving in a year and a half
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh and i know a lot of couples starting out i don't think they really think about
saving any either
you know and
now i know you know as my mom and dad that's been a big part on them and i think it will be a big part on us also but i know a lot of couples don't even think about it or retirement or you know or in case an accident would occur
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah it is really pretty easy i mean myself i'm a college student and i get loans you know i don't receive grants but i do have loans and just in the matter since christmas
i've managed to pay about five hundred dollars on my wedding dress myself you know and it it's amazing where you can cut your pennies and you know
no i
uh-huh
well i really can't think of anything else on it
it's been really nice talking to you too uh-huh bye-bye
okay why do you think it failed do you think we should adopt it
you don't
um-hum
yeah
yeah
right
yeah i agree with you i don't think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system i don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the disadvantages that would happen to the people of america
because i think they that's an area that the other nations especially europe look down on us like oh we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet
and i feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us and it's like hey we're content with this no it's probably not as accurate probably
yeah
um-hum
right
there's a lot of people like you're educated i'm educated my husband is
but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated
and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college or i don't know how much of the you know but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population
they don't have any college probably much at all and if we can't take it and use it easily well we how can you put that on like elderly people and
you know just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as much sharpness and mental acuity
yeah
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah
yeah i think it failed too because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous i think americans have so much stress on them right now
yeah and it's just like another thing the american family doesn't need any more pressure just leave them alone let them measure their green bean water in cups and leave them alone
i don't know
yeah
uh-huh that's
and if they don't like the way we do it just get off our don't worry about it and i think
right it is because it is another language yeah
that's funny well that's good -ll i think we kept it at real good
is that all we need to say
you too i think that was good that was the best one usually i get distracted off the topic you know what i mean
and we'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in lithuania and we were talking about something income tax or something and i just
anyway the i appreciate it have a good day
what do you usually wear to
um-hum
oh i see
um-hum
well that's nice comfortable stuff
wow
wow that's nice
you know nicer usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts stuff like that so then it's still
you know the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and
coming in out of the office but you still have to have a professional
image kind of thing to go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that so
oh really
um-hum
wow that must be nice atmosphere then
oh
um-hum
wow
right
hum that's interesting
um-hum
um-hum
oh
um-hum
oh well that's nice that's good for the clothes budget i would imagine because here
gosh we had
the winter hasn't been bad this winter it's it it's only snowed maybe once or twice but it's been cold low twenties let's say and then the summer gets up to eighties nineties so
well this is the season for vacations and
i guess for places i like to go i enjoy going to the beach and
having outdoor being outdoors somewhere and someplace that's very different than texas and as far as
maybe as the summer heat comes along i'd sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot and being able to be outside and enjoy outsor -side activities so
enjoy going places where i enjoy playing tennis so i like to have a tennis court there or if it's at the beach the beach is great a pool is great and
oh well let's see we have plans this year to drive up to the to colorado and we'll be going to estes park and colorado springs so
one year we went to the southwest corner of colorado into durango and north of the area there and
boy that's a nice place to visit it's really nice there's a nice train ride that goes up to the city of silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining
and then actually north of that is another town and
a smaller on a smaller scale i guess than silverton but and then there's lots and lots of real of mountains that are covered with boulders
so i guess people jeep through that area and we didn't have a chance to do that but i sure would like to go back there and do that again
i haven't been but i've heard it's wonderful
right
right and the beach is nice the beach is really nice isn't it
oh
sea shells
sea shells
yeah
oh where do you stay and my husband always wants to go to destin we just haven't gone that direction yet
okay
right
right
oh nice
oh
right
oh
well we've just
we've just
are you driving
oh
well
well we're the neighborhood that we live in they're switching to an alternate calendar this year so
it starting
well starting at the end of july we'll have two vacation weeks in october and two vacation weeks in march
so that'll be interesting turn on vacations for our family
so
and in and in the summer would be more like a two month
two month break
so and they hope to boost the
they hope to boost the learning of the children
just the retention of
the material for them so
yeah so
we'll head for we'll head for florida maybe in somewhat of an off season instead of summer
so
well that's probably all we need to do today
all right
thanks a lot
um-hum
right
nah i wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means you know i would there there's a lot of times though you get those calls and you know
when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or whatnot and you know next thing you know
someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to tell them you know that you're not interested or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you know and
keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me but i don't know that you could call that invading of invading my privacy because
it doesn't
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
um-hum
hm
good grief
well let me ask you about this here's something that -s been kind of concerning me lately my fiance received a bill from a lord and taylor company you know they're a they're a department store
she received a bill from them that she had visited some store and i think it was there in florida maybe it was in miami
that she had visited a store there and they had this bill that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise
and the date that she supposedly made this purchase she was in denver with me for thanksgiving and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number
and i've heard recently that
that this is a common occurrence where people are using you know they use joe blow's social security number and can potentially ruin someone's credit
huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah well
yeah
yeah well we got it cleared up eventually what happened
okay what do you do
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
well when i was married my husband budgeted you know very tightly
but then every time there was any and he made sure of it if there was any extra money for anything he spent it
right so you know that type of budget i didn't you know i didn't i felt like i was getting the short end of the stick
you know so but i'm divorced now so i don't even have a bank account
i have a my the company that i'm working for has a credit union and i put in the credit union every week
a substantial amount of my check
and then when i have some extra monthly or quarterly bills like insurances and taxes and things like that
then i draw out of that savings account to cover those extra expenses
and i you know i'm still very tight with my money course i make very little also
but i couldn't i just couldn't stand the pressure of having a checking account and being concerned about having a check that wasn't covered
because they're really expensive down here on a you know if you if you misfigure your check you on a ten or twenty dollar check any size check it could cost you easy fifty dollars to get it
straightened out
so and my budget doesn't stand for that
so but i've i save i haven't the last two years i have saved in an ira every year
saved enough money to buy an you know to pay for a two thousand dollar ira every year
and i'm in the credit union not the credit union the company savings and investment plan
and i save six percent there i actually nine percent there they add three percent to it
so i'm you know i'm
well i'm saving you know i even though i make very little money and you know and me it's me and my daughter
and so you know i'm doing better i'm came out of a job that paid very well
like for down here i made twenty five to thirty thousand a year and my ex made under forty
and now the first year i was out on my own i made four i made twelve thousand
yes it was tough
so i'm doing better and but i'm still saving more money now than i did when i was married
they do here they you know a lot of people i mean they are and every time they have like a car break down
it was awful they didn't have to follow regulations of any kind
and so the people would every time they had trouble they didn't have to manage their money they'd just have to go sign their life away and get money from the credit union
and they just they ended up a lot of them ended up owing more at the credit union than they could then they could ever pay
and they wouldn't get very much of a paycheck at all
because of the credit union taking so much out and they didn't weren't willing to manage their checks
you know and but i it was pitiful i mean you think good grief y'all what is your you know why but
um-hum
well if you
exactly you know if you are not willing to budget your money then you know if you're not willing to be careful and live on what you make
well you've got to wonder what really happened in the so-called august coup who really planned that thing out who stood to benefit
oh well i suspect that mister yeltsin probably knows a lot more about it than he's ever let on
well
of course there's always the problem of the twelfth republic georgia that's in a civil war right now what happens with them
no their no they went all three of those
latvia estonia and lithuania went completely independent and had nothing to do with the commonwealth of states
so they each three separate republics although i think the three of them have gone in together in some sort of confederation while they each are supposedly independent
well then what happens in the un russia supposedly gets the soviet union's seat and what happens with the eleven other republics i guess they don't get anything who knows
i don't know if these all are really independent countries or like states in the united states it almost looks likes some ways like the old confederate states of america is almost what this arrangement looks like
you've got eleven or twelve basically quote independent republics which are in a confederation does look a lot you know i think if we went back and looked at civil war documents it'd be a similar arrangement to the confederate states of america
well you have to look back to the great expansion of peter the great followed by catherine the great which pretty well set the course for what then became the soviet union
i mean it has its roots back there in the in the early seventeen hundreds
oh i think one person put it aptly the ruble is rubbish
course then the problem is what they do with their nuclear weapons that's the more interesting problem
well who knows what they're going to do with them
well of course the question is what gorbachev does i guess he goes and writes his memoirs or something
i think he's turned that down now
well i don't think he i don't think he wants to do that but he certainly would be like an elder statesman or whatever
or how i survived the august coup but really didn't survive it
yeah jonathan you say it's near and dear to your heart buying a car is something you're contemplating i take it
ah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh what do you think you'll what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next
um-hum
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
and whatever i get i wanna have air bags both driver's and passenger side and a four door because
it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them stoop down to get over so i think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that you know reasonable cost and
safety and as much economy as you can get out of a car
you know i'm not looking for one with a great big engine something that'll carry it around safely i guess is best way to describe it
right now we've got a v-6 in it and that seems to be just fine i know they they're coming out with some v-8s now and i think that's probably a little overkill for this day and age
um-hum
right
i drive a truck a ford truck i like trucks because they're spacious and
it's handy to haul things it's not related to my business i just you really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when i've had to
wow
hm
uh-huh
what kind of what make is the mini van
mazda i see
uh-huh
right
um-hum
one of my sons has a plymouth van or you know that same type of thing the voyager i guess
and they have a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and their stuff and of course as he gets friends i'm sure that'll
be even handier so i know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value
what about all wheel drive is that something that you'd be interested in or is that a not an issue
um-hum
uh-huh
right
what do you think about the benefits in jobs
uh-huh
yeah and a lot of times they turn down your claims so that leaves you paying for all of it
uh-huh
yeah
right the health insurance i have is metlife and if it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then you just pay ten dollars and then the insurance pays the rest of the bill
or if you go outside you get seventy thirty
uh-huh
right and they're probably doing it to their benefit anyway so
uh-huh
well i work for sears and that's about the only real benefit you have is health insurance
yeah but everybody gets vacation i mean like ti and some other places you know they have recreational facilities and
they have a driving range and weight room and you know i think they even have a swimming pool and
i don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
yeah well i don't know the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits
some places aren't very safe to work
and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you that you have to work under
right uh-huh
yeah i think so
uh-huh
workmen's comp is a big thing now in texas because
how much it costs the employers and a lot of them are going to their own insurance now
and it reduces some of the length of the benefits and
and i don't know besides that but i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing
well they still have to pay it but they buy their own instead of going through the state
so apparently it costs less that way
uh-huh
yeah that's what i what i think they should be able they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are
and how much profit they're making instead of trying to cut everything down and then have everybody be unhappy and have a constant turnover of people
yeah the productivity and the training costs if they have to train the same employee a new employee every six months then i don't see how they can save money
you know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them
yeah okay it was nice talking to you
yeah bye-bye
well i think don that maybe immigration is more of an issue in my part of the country than it is in yours do you suppose that's true
but
yeah well of course we're quite a ways from the mexican border here
but oh you hear on the news and whatnot of
some of the sad things associated with immigration like loading up a truck full of immigrants and it runs out of gas or something and they sit out in bake in the sun because they're locked in the back of it and things like that
so there are a lot of tragedies i think associated with immigration
yeah oh absolutely i mean what i see is mexico of course rather south american countries
unfortunately i think that the immigrants tend to really stretch the social services that can be provided to the folks
crime for example and
i don't know i think it's all tied up together i know that the immigrant of course now dallas has a lot of
asian immigrants in fact a large community of them
and they have their special problems
you know they have fear of the police and whatnot
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
yeah
oh i think i think they want to work i think they're often under educated
i think that's why maybe one reason why they have so much difficult in their own countries
i
i have trouble with
well actually i think it's good i hope that we get a chance to promote peace out there
because i think without peace we're not going to get stable oil prices and
and i'd really like to see stability in that area because i'm always afraid that's where another big war is going to start
not that desert storm was a small one
i saw just recently where the us is supposedly going to be putting pressure on all the you know the israelis supposedly to come to a bargaining table to
actually i heard that the israelis were even at least mentioned about giving up some of the golan heights
yeah
okay
well i guess it's one of those things that if it's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace
yeah
do you think the us is going to wind up keeping military bases over there
i haven't heard that i watch cnn every once in a while but i haven't specifically heard anything about that
what i thought was interesting is that apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet
yeah
do you have relatives over in israel
oh really
yeah
do you does she ever want to go back to syria
oh okay
no
do you ever want to go over to israel
oh okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah no kishkes or knishes or
oh
i got you
yeah
still get your passover matzi and all that right
oh really i dated i dated a nice jewish girl for many years up in chicago
okay
oh
wow
yeah
well they had the matter of fact i just watched charles heston this weekend in the ten commandments
did you
well that's to me it's really
i guess i guess i can intellectually kind of come to grips with all of that but you know emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that
that people that believe in god and love not war and to forgive can't get together
you know i know that the problems are so deep but i mean even within the muslim religions different sects they can't get together
yeah
or the you know the catholics and the protestants up in ireland
you know i mean i
yeah
yeah
yeah
it sounds like a it sounds like a john lennon type
gosh
