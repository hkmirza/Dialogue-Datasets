i don't really have a favorite type i like a lot of different types of music
yeah i have a tape collection that i like to listen to cassette tapes but it's pretty varied yeah how about you
that's exactly me the acid rock or the heavy metal even some of that i like okay but not mostly as a general rule i don't care for that at all
well as far as the rap goes i think there are a few artists that appeal to me
themselves and i like some of their songs but as i agree as a general rule i wouldn't choose rap either
i like i said pretty varied music i have a couple that my husband really hates when i listen to them
like billy holiday i really love to listen to her and i even have a tape of lady smith blackman bazo
so they're interesting to listen to you might try that how about you
oh yeah
it it's too you have to concentrate on it seems
what about the blues or something like that
uh-huh
sons of the pioneers you know stuff like that
i have some spiro gyro tapes
al jarreau he's somebody i like he's pretty kind of jazz inspired but still kind of pop too
oh yeah and you know what i like the most about him is i've gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he's having fun
i mean some people sing and they have their faces all contorted like it hurts them or something
but he looks like he's having a good time i mean he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and like all he wants to do is make the audience enjoy it too
and he he's real fun to listen to
bonnie rait i like her a lot in fact when ever she won her big grammy i think there was like five of them or something was it five or
yeah last year or the year before i can't remember but i was listening to a particular radio station and the one dj said who the heck is bonnie rait and why does she deserve five grammies
and i vowed then that i was not gonna listen to that radio station any more if that dj could make such an
my wife and i did have a budget we were both working at the time and so forth
and
that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and other big bills taken care of
we have a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation
so it it's been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and other major things were taken care of
and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so we're we don't have to have quite as strict a budget as we did
sure uh-huh
i think i've i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously
you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i have enough food already stored here that i don't have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there
as the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that
and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal storage
we put it up the other person might not know about it
uh-huh
yeah
we are going to be traveling to europe with a choral we sing with this so called pennsylvania choral and we make a two weeks
tour of foreign countries and of course that costs money
so we each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that we gather together over a period a time enough money to make this trip
so that is another way of budgeting
and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we just live a normal life but we don't throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is always very nice
well let's face it then when we talking budget
level of my checking account and i have a money market account also
and i keep those levels up above a certain minimum
and i'm always trying to
one that i can't find anymore which is gabriel's fire
yes
it was usually on thursday nights
it was same time period yes
you don't know what happened to gabriel's fire then
i don't remember one from one station to another i keep forgetting one station
what's your second favorite
oh is he the reformed gambler yes
i really don't watch that much tv what i do is i tape the programs i want to watch and then on the nights i can watch i'll pick out something
but
midnight
midnight
i tape it
yeah i tape it because i don't stay up that late to watch it i tape it
but i understand that in england they play it at normal times because they don't consider that violent
and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program
and
i'm like i don't believe this
i don't either
you're in new york
oh
i'm in dallas texas
oh really
oh
i think it's great i love watching a microbiologist
fighting off with a policemen or something else and competition
i'm going oh great you know
it's a it's a great role model for everybody
oh yes i mean when i had i was watching it the first time i ever saw a microbiologist on there i thought well it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities
and there she was terrific she was really terrific
they hold competitions in los angeles in florida and minneapolis
trying to think of i think it's in four places around the united states they hold competition and the only requirement
is of course your skill of passing these tests
and that's it
and
we had a bar man from here in dallas area that made it there is a woman that made
well she called herself a craft person so i'm not quite sure what she made
and she made it i mean there is no your occupation has nothing to do with it
strictly your skill
huh-uh
i think the last i heard was it's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars
uh-huh
yeah that's you know just minor
just minor little ball here or there you know
oh well they come out with a lot of bruises too
hey
see i tape murder she wrote
i like mysteries
i like mysteries
i tape father dowling
because that's another mystery
and i don't have to concentrate too hard on them
most of the lawyer programs like law and order
they're not on the times that i've got
that i've watched because i haven't had t got tv guide around here in ages
yeah
your news is on at eleven
ten i was just in the middle of watching it
oh that's okay no problem
no well they have it at six and they have it at nine
and they have one at ten
i'm trying to think
both let's see they start evening shade at
seven and then it goes to
what is it after evening
that's major dad at eight i think it is
huh
yeah it's stopped around here at ten and it goes into night programs
at that point which could be one of you know many different night programs but it goes into night programs
but do you ever watch cheers
oh yeah oh yeah
okay we're talking about houses and if they're typical for the area
well i don't live in a house i live in a duplex
it's typical for the area i would say uh-huh
it's stone and wood it's a combination
which is very typical for austin
oh
well when you talk about that this is a really
i lost my house because i divorced and couldn't make the payments and long sad typical divorce story and
i found a very nice area usually when you're talking rental property and duplexes you're not in with nicer homes
but there are beautiful homes in the area and they are it's not like tract housing at all not a it it's a i don't know if you're familiar with where northwest hills is in austin but that's where i am
um-hum
just to visit your sister
oh okay
are the homes in your area what square footage are they
okay
um-hum
well that is really nice i like that and the maintenance is low and it always looks good
um-hum what about the thing that i noticed and liked very much and hadn't seen at all from the twin cities
in texas it's so common to have one of those pretty wooden front doors with the iron you know the pretty window in it
not stained glass but you know i don't know what bevelled glass right or frosted is that common in your area
oh
um-hum that's what more typical around here
um-hum
that it sounds like you're in a very pretty area
uh-huh
um-hum
right do you work for ti
i don't either i had been working there and i left ti to see if i could find something that would pay me a little better
and that was in january and so far it hasn't proved to work out that way
well
i guess i'm not one to go back it's maybe make another step or another direction i know the day i left it was real funny one of my past bosses
looked at me and said when i told him good-bye and i was just talking to someone seeing whether or not i couldn't hire you back
absolutely
well thanks so much what do you do
um-hum
oh okay
i
oh i understand where that's where i was from
i'm terrible at staying on the on the subject so if you want me to stay on it i'll try
that's why i'm struggling so much to
i'm paying terrible rent in this duplex i can't buy in the area
but it i'm trying to keep my daughters in the schools they were in and so far i'm managing it so that's it means a lot yeah
me
um-hum
right
well we're definitely checking out our options to get back to your how many people how many houses in your area have pools
oh and do you have one
that's
well i understand that just to keep the filters running keep it clean keep it warm or cool or whatever right
um-hum
you don't you don't really tend to use it as much as you anticipate you will either
and then and it also had the sign on it with a swimming pool so me being the eternal optimist that i am i'm going to work saying okay i've got the number i know it's going to rent for a lot more than what i'm used to paying but
you know with the pool and the extra bedroom it was going to be so nice maybe i can do it
so i called and found out how much it costs to rent this place per month and i could not believe it nineteen hundred dollars
i could not believe it
um-hum
are they intermixed very well or does it seem to be streets that are
exactly
wow
oh my goodness
yes
oh that is
that's great planning
oh that sounds nice
is your
no go ahead
um-hum
oh that's kind of what i left it's not quite as wasn't quite as big as that but it was wonderful
well that's great i hope you'll appreciate this i was just smiling as you said i designed it myself and you had already shared your name
there's a sound like a panel topic we're talking about what we can do to make
short long-term goals to be able to get
a better value
out of what we already pay
and i wanted to say something to you about ross perot are you familiar with the man
yeah but he does raise some interesting points like
uh-huh the
the question he raised in my mind was he was speaking in front of the national press club the other day
for a year
not enough money
only half as much as we need
so another words
four hundred billion dollars is hell of a lot of money
and that's just he deficit just this year
there's apparently a hundred and eighty billion dollars that the president's own controller will tell you is fault and mismanagement
i think that would be the short-term goals
get rid of the fraud and mismanagement
apparently they have plenty of time
the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well it's going to cost a billion dollars to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me
it's a human element but the mechanical element of it can i mean mechanical meaning a computer could help
could help track
and find out what's going on you know statistical cross-referencing and you know the pork barrel and all that other stuff that they you know
they do to keep in office to stay in office
i think term limitations are a viable a viable way to cut the amount of money we spend in government
if you know we say the president can be limited to two terms and we don't limit
congress critters at all
uh-huh
yeah especially now after this rubber gate thing you know they it's something that everyone can identify with and
and if they can't even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget
oh that
um-hum
yeah i think it's
i've been studying some libertarian views
and i've been thinking more and more that maybe we need to get government out of
out of business and away from business and out of everybody's hair
um-hum
um-hum
well
you know what i watched a little bit of the bulls game and i had to leave in fact i think the bulls were ahead when i when i left who won the game
is that right
uh-huh
yeah
wow
they look good
yeah now i don't i haven't kept up with what was going on with the
uh-huh
good move
yeah
i think boston's in first
yeah that always makes a big difference so
yeah
and you know you know i used to think that one player really doesn't make the club
but it really does you know you get somebody like magic and you can see the decline of that team
oh yeah
who won that portland game
well i would say as far as social changes go
i think families were more together they did more things together they ate dinner at the table together
the parents usually took out time you know more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity
although i'm not a mother i still think that a lot has changed since ten years ago
what do you think about that
yeah
um-hum
yes what about like as far as social changes in the individual
do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let's say ten twenty years ago
um-hum
well how old are you
twenty eight okay i'm twenty three
so there's maybe a five year gap between us
so
huh
yes
um-hum
do you think it's an economic necessity or do you think that we're all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living
i mean do you think people really need two cars and
a house in the suburbs or
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
okay
um-hum
you so you think it's
which group are you saying is the one trying
um-hum
um-hum
okay
okay and then sometimes i often find that
you know a special a dishwasher a refrigerator and some of those items
for the for the well i guess we're sticking more to social changes but
people want all of that and not all of those are necessities
so they're trying to
it has become a necessity
there we go
uh-huh
oh great
oh
how nice
oh
well that is nice was it was it awkward at first or did it work out fairly good
yes uh-huh
right
um-hum
oh great uh-huh
now are you from quite a ways away from each other so that you don't see each other real often
oh
oh yes
oh yes okay well we have
several different reunions
when i was like you say when i was growing up we had a lot of family reunions and they were the extent of the cousins and you know relatives and great-aunts and uncles and
yes it is and it and these are people that we see you know just once maybe twice a year
and we get together then and have a christmas party and
and you know have a dinner and a program and renew acquaintances and
and then in the summer on my mom's side of the family we go camping up in up in the mountains like you mentioned yes it is it's fun
yes we are there's lots of lots of nice places to go and i know some families have a real formal type thing where they send out
yes
yes that is in fact i in a in a magazine i'd read an article about different ways to plan a family reunion and
you know if you had a real big like you say a real big organization and a lot of
a lot of planning went into it that would that would be great but we tend to stick to the
call each other and you know we plan on those two that i mentioned every year for sure but
yeah
that's right
that's right because you do you forget
the cousins i have they grow up and change and you know you wouldn't even recognize them sometimes other than these times that you get together
so do you have any with your extended family or is it mostly your sisters and
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh yeah
uh-huh
boy i'll say yeah so do you when you have your when you got together with your sisters last year did was there a lot of catching up to do
a lot of changes that had happened since the last time
um-hum
oh
uh-huh did you take your kids with you or was it the adults
oh how fun oh that's fun
oh uh-huh
that makes a big difference
uh-huh
oh
that is that is that's it's a fun thing to do and i think it's important that we keep doing that because everybody is so busy you lose
you lose touch and you lose ties
oh were they
oh
well great boy i'll say yes i my brothers are scattered all around too and that's you know
that's the first i've ever heard of it i haven't heard of it
anything too much about it
uh-huh
uh-huh
right yeah i the my first impression was it would be very good i think it would be good for people to serve but
i don't know if it should be an option it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids and i think there are some
available now where they are able to work but making it a mandatory thing
kind of
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
it seems like you'd have a lot more conscientious objectors if they had that choice
yeah you know i'd much rather work in a hospital than to go to war and i'm sure most young men and women would and so
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that makes sense and then you run into again to
the bureaucracy in running it you know how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then
so
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
plus the training involved yeah that would be expensive in most cases
because
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i know in i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught christianity in japan
and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me it taught me not to be so self-centered and it you know to think of others
but i don't know if i was doing it
in different situation you know not a really religious background if i would get a lot out of it you know i think i did because it you know it emphasized that sort of thing you know a lot of
self
evaluation but
right and that i'm sure that would make a big difference too
you know we've got
well like i say i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth like teenagers to go
and do work in the national parks and work in neighborhoods to do clean up and that sort of thing but i don't know
what organization it's under i don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private
charity that's put it together but i know that helps a lot with training and
a lot of
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah how much benefit it'll do them in the long run
so that's yeah so that may not may not benefit them in the long run
but
okay well thank you too bye-bye
yes
oh i love food and i love to cook i really love to cook i'm not a really gourmet cook i'm just a normal everyday cook what about you
don't you do you miss meat at all
um-hum
so if you have if you have people over would you fix all vegetables or you know when you cook for company do you fix just all vegetables
yeah
yes but that's
do you eat cheese do you eat eggs an
yeah
yeah
but it's becoming more that way i think it's probably easier now to find things
yeah
i don't think i even know what a lentil is
i've heard i've heard of a lentil
uh-huh um-hum
you had to learn i was going to say you have to learn a whole new way to cook
oh no way
but i bet it's really i bet it is healthy because a couple of times last week i went without meat
i had pasta and salad for two days just because i just you know oh no particular reason i just didn't feel like eating meat and i think even after two days i felt different
yeah
yeah
so when you prepare a meal like say on thanksgiving what do you
yeah
everything but the turkey
yeah
even the turkey yeah that's true
well do they have special cookbooks out for just vegetarian meals you know special books that you
but you don't eat fish either do you
i have a
i have a hard time with vegetables i don't i when i was a kid i didn't like them very much and i never really learned how to cook them
right i guess i don't know
i'll eat a little bit of broccoli and i'll steam it and i like carrots just certain things you know but i'm not really good with them and i'll go sometimes and not even fix them i mean i'll have everything else and no vegetable that's strange isn't it
yeah
but now if you cook them wrong you can loose the vitamins to
and i'm terribly overweight i'm obese probably is the word i've never used that word on myself before but i am very large and probably if i could give up the meat products and just get on vegetables i would probably look a lot better
well what are the others
well it's helpful
well do you keep up with the statistical stuff
well there's a guy on that was on norm hisken's show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does it's essentially trivial statistics but they've got a it's a statistic that has to do with winning
and losing one run games
and apparently the rangers last year won a lot of one run games
well it is but it's the it's a reverse indicator
well what the what the argument is and it it's one of these statistical gee how can you draw a conclusion from it but they find that there's a connection between that and how they do in spring training the following year
and it's strangely enough it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year
which means that if you have a good year winning one run games that the following year
you'll have a bad year and they they've got they've looked at i think twenty three teams
and the statistics are something like twenty one out of twenty three it was which means that the rangers are going to have a terrible year i
well i mean and it's i don't know what do you what do you think of incaviglia's loss
well it it's an interesting concept though when you look at of how baseball how apparently i was reading in the paper tonight that the detroit tigers are going to sign him
and the point of i guess i don't understand the strategy of how baseball works but it seems that
you know they can sign him tomorrow and he could go in the team the next day and they put him in the lineup and he hits a home run and all of a sudden he becomes a hero and all he has to do is hit the ball i mean it's not
and all he has to do is one you know hit it once it doesn't he can he can he can swing a couple times if he if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can it's an interesting
an interesting concept of how they do that but i agree with you i think that i think that's part of what
baseball needs more of i guess what bothers me is that when you go you wait and wait and wait and finally a guy gets up there and blast a home run
and that's all the game is i'd rather see the ball hit around and
have the people
yes
yeah well how do you think the royals are going to do
well are they going to beat are they going to beat oakland
yeah
well i go to saint louis from time to time and i watch i watch their sports up there and they're certainly intense about the cardinals they
did you actually live in saint louis
everybody does right
i had a friend from college that lives in yeah it's well i should say on the west side i mean everything's on the west side manchester
out that way and went and visited him but anyway it is interesting well how are the cardinals do you still keep up with them or something
well is that a good indicator
you know what i think's remarkable is it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have really breakthrough years
and the question is how do you forecast that if you had to you know if you had to bet on who would be in the world series i mean it'd be really tough
yeah
yeah
well when are the rangers going to come through with it
well is there enough money that's part of it i oh that was part of skip bayless argument i don't know if you read skip bayless but a local commentary and
his argument is that the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to bring in the big dollars
would you would you agree with that
yeah
well didn't kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff
yeah
well and that i think that's maybe part of it that the and it you know if i owned the team i think you'd like them to do well but the question of losing big money that what didn't did steinbrenner actually make money on the
well it yeah it's a little bit like any other sport you know when it starts costing you fifty to a hundred dollars to go to a game
and you know i mean i guess as we get older if you're probably going if you if you compare to go to a sport a say you go to a rock concert or even a performance
an opera or the symphony or something if you know but how often do you do that and i would i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there you know several times a
yeah
yeah but don't you think there's a the there're older fans there i don't mean older you know the fact that it's a better established and that the city is more of a of a
yeah
so it's really small and i think it's really nice because you know it's real easy we don't really have much to do but it's just me and him so if he needs something done i do it or
you know it just goes straight from me to him and we don't have to go through a bunch of people like you're saying but
but sometimes it's kind of bad because if i'm sick then i kind of i usually have to go in unless i'm you know have to stay in bed because i'm the only one there yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah and also in big companies they have like vacations and all no if i take a vacation i've got to get a friend or someone else to come in for a temporary to come in for a week
so
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
a friend of mine works for a stockbroker and it's a really it's a big company and they said that
as a after she works there a year as long as she takes business courses they'll reimburse her
so that's pretty nice so that she could move up in the company
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's
yeah that would be nice
yeah
yeah they moved my dad worked for i'm not even sure where but they moved us from dallas to san antonio and then back to dallas
we kind of got moved around but it was pretty nice because you know we lived in san antonio for a while and all
i mean i guess it's nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next be near them you can see it switch through the company to over at that state or whatever
yeah i do i mean i think it kind of helped us because you know we weren't just living in dallas and didn't exactly know just everything about dallas and you know i mean i doubt seriously that
if we had stayed here that i would have been able to move to get to san antonio very much so
no we had family in dallas and we moved to san antonio and we were kind of like everybody else is in oklahoma and louisiana
so but i guess it was pretty nice because you know we got to experience living down there somewhere different
yeah
yeah
well i always think i'm paying too much taxes how about you
although at least texas doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're going to enact this i think
the other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a state income tax
uh-huh
yeah makes quite a bit of difference in your well your income level you know because other states take quite a bit a chunk out for city and state taxes so you're looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference
a little more take home here
yeah richardson area
yeah i work at well mainly the expressway site is where i work
yeah
or up to collin county somewhere that you're getting out of the dallas county area because what do we pay like eight and a half percent something like that for the sales tax
which yeah that really is pretty high
i think so although i really i don't go up there too much i mean i normally just kind of go to richardson square mall or valley view mall just kind of for the convenience
yeah
uh-huh
yeah that's true although i wish you know overall they'd try the lottery again when did you first come to texas
well that's about the same time as me i came down in eighty two
well ohio kind of my parents live in ohio i had lived a little while in michigan but you know basically i went to high school and college in ohio and lived there more years than i ever did in michigan
oh okay but you know when we first came down here i really thought this place was somewhat backward i mean i was just shocked that we couldn't shop on sunday
remember
uh-huh
uh-huh
were you shocked like oh no i'm stuck i need to buy stuff
uh-huh
oh few places now seem to do it by the slice but
right
well the there was other things too i mean i think it's taken us yankee's influence down here to get them to come to the you know the correct decade here and century
i couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer or alcohol whatever in the car
i mean you could always be careful about that back then because you know if a cop stopped you then you would you know get arrested or whatnot and people would just drink openly
uh-huh
oh well i don't smoke so i don't really know what the taxes are and stuff on it
so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes
huh
gee
they're cheaper there
oh
oh i got you okay
uh-huh
well how'd you do
a dollar oh well but you had fun playing right
um-hum
yeah that's an interesting point i work in the computer business which tends to be pretty
high pressure and time consuming and i work with a lot of guys who are just now having first and second kids and it's interesting to see how they handle it because in a lot of cases they're still trying to put in the hours but they're also trying to spend a lot of time at home
and in many cases they've got spouses who work so it's an interesting juggling pattern i
my impression is that people try to do both if they can as tough as that is
boy that's a good question i've my kids are eight and a half and
work long hours so that you know during a particular week i might not see them as much as i wanted to
but i do sense that people's expectations today are often different than they were maybe in my parent's generation where
you know child raising was kind of seen as the
the woman's responsibility and if the man had to work extra long hours or travel you know that's just the way it was i think
today men have somewhat different expectations when they try to tailor their schedules as much as they can
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
yeah i think there's a lot to that you really have to establish relationship early on
yeah certainly read a lot or heard a lot of stories about people who grow up saying i felt i never really knew my father
and i you know it's hard to say i don't
travel in a wide social circle but it's my impression that a lot of people today a lot of men are trying to change anyway
yeah
yeah i was just saying yeah
yeah actually i've heard a lot of that from my son who you know goes through periods were he's particularly
attached to mom and when i say i love you know he says i hate you
try to plan outings to museum say take them to playgrounds you know baseball in the back yard that kind of thing a lot of times following his lead he's currently obsessed with legos i mean he
i'm a little i'm a
not i think that
that i do i i'm not sure that
that i think it should be like a normal practice all the time i think there are certain circumstances where it's important but it kind of touches on privacy
in that addiction thing you know and it's bad for them but
and some jobs require you to be
straight and with it to do a good job and protect yourself and
and things like that too you know so how you think how you feel
right
there you go that's right
um-hum
um-hum
wow
yeah
right
yeah well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long that company decides well if we're going to hire new people you know
well we're going to have to start checking it because we've had a problem in the past
yeah
there's one of the big problems people are in that situation they need that job
and
oh really
lucky you
uh-huh
right
right because you're not gonna get the job if you don't
yeah
huh
i don't know
you know
smuggle it in
i know people who do i don't think
oh really i just
oh i just got mine last week and i haven't started yet because i wanted to get one first see how it worked
really yeah
i have i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago but i forgot it already
oh
that's your weekend yeah really
really i didn't see that because i didn't think i would care for it
oh
yes i did see that and i really enjoyed that
yeah i thought that was appropriate just for everyone yeah that was great
yeah and my daughter went to see that one too so it was fine for her
so yeah
right well that's right
probably they have them my daughter is twelve
and we had a sleep over one night they wanted to watch pretty woman which i have and i was hesitant and they all had seen it anyway
yes they do yes they do
really
oh i love pretty woman and then i like that one after that where oh what was it was like a fatal attraction thing yeah
i don't remember the name of it but that was so good
that was really excellent
what was
oh i don't know
really
i that scared me to death and i watched it at a friend's house on video and i was just oh yes it was horrible it was so awful
really
i like that too i like funny movies and i like scary movies
yeah
is he really
oh
yeah yes it's so close because i'm from long island so that's close you know that's more related to new jersey than it is to like rochester new york those that kind of thing
yeah different it's different yeah i guess
oh
really
really and they were all from new jersey hum
really yeah
huh
when did you live there
are you from texas
oh yeah
oh yeah
it is it is yeah
i'm used to it now so i like
hum
oh yes it was because we're here eighteen years
and you can imagine what plano was like eighteen years ago
it was very difficult
yeah it was very difficult i didn't even want to talk
yeah
yeah so
yeah i also haven't thought too much about it but i suspect it very much depends upon the job
maybe there are some jobs where i guess it doesn't really
i mean it's if it's not affecting someone's performance i'm not sure if it's a problem
if it's a position where it could potentially affect
you know if
right
that don't
right and then if you're a computer operator and there's really no big deal i think you know then maybe it's not
necessary
um-hum
but
yeah well i think it may i mean that in that respect i think it may help a lot i think it may be pushing people away from hopefully push people away from drug use if they know that you know well if you use drugs you won't get this job i mean
yeah
yeah i don't know
i don't know the that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i don't i don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system i've heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for six months some stay for less some stay for longer i mean
they think lsd i guess stay forever in some ways i mean if you get flashbacks for
forever
i guess so
i mean there must be some
some something i mean people who people get these little flashback things you know
of some sort so i don't really know
right well the same here actually i don't use drugs at all and i and i'm at most a social drinker so it's so it's never a problem
um-hum right
right that
that's a fine line to draw
i mean that that's really you know do you
do you worry about you know this or that i mean you know what about their rights to privacy well if they're doing something illegal there they have a private you know like especially in the case of drinking you know if someone's
is something more than a social drinker shall we say yet they're not an alcoholic what do you do
so
well those are just yeah those it turns out those are just to get a probably to get some sort of
those are to get some shock value out of you or just to see what happens when you get shocked yeah there's i do some i'm a student in
and we sort of you know figure out
yeah otherwise they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping around and being fidgety and they say that you would sort of it can be shocking and it they want to see how easy it is shock you
yeah
yeah well i guess so i mean i guess i don't i don't what actually happens if
you get a big a big jump there you know
but yeah it's i think it's their way of seeing how well you do in a shock situation without worrying about you know stuff like that so
yeah and i don't think that you killed your mother though i wouldn't worry about that
um-hum
yeah that's you know it could blow things right away for them you know unless they say well look i mean unless they walk it won't
i'm thinking walk in and say look i did do drugs you know a year ago and i'm off them for a year now and this and that and so if you if i take i'll be happy to take the test but it will show up positive of course i think
yeah
yeah because then i mean then although legally they can't discriminate you i think on the basis but i'm not sure
but i don't i don't really know i don't know what the laws are pertaining to this my wife probably does but
i don't i don't of this stuff
but yeah it's an interesting topic that they've actually thought about your right in that it doesn't
um-hum
so i think that's real good
well been nice talking to you too
so you have a son
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum uh-huh
yeah
i would think so when you when your son was at home did you working did you work or were you able to stay at home with him
uh-huh
yeah well when my mom when i was growing up my mom worked too but she worked nights
and as a nurse and so she was always home for us
and i always i really appreciated that having her there when i was you know when i came home from school and when i worked
but now when i look back at it must have been a really difficult thing that she did for us
yeah
yeah
they really do a family without a father is it's a it's a really hard thing
uh-huh
kids i think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway
oh yeah oh yeah our uh-huh but we're we just got married like december so we're going to wait a year and then we will try
uh-huh
yeah that's a possibility yeah well we really want to have a family we feel like that couple you know
you're not giving enough of yourself and you should you should be sharing your family
and giving your values to you know making something better of the world by raising up good kids and letting them know they're loved and stuff give them give them an edge but
we feel like the first year needs to be devoted to making the family the couple strong and secure in their love for each other
but then a family is definitely a high priority
well i i'm in a different situation i am a missionary
and i'm home on furlough it's called like i've worked for four years in africa and i come home for a year
and then we go back for four years but my husband and i will do the same job and we'll be living in africa and we'll be working together
so we will we will share the job of raising the family i mean as a mother i'll have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have but still we'll share that job
but we have then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program
you know that kind of thing
or do you send them away to boarding school and if you do that when do you do it and that's a
uh-huh
well
oh i'm ready yeah sure
karen my name's john benyak where do you live
oh i live in dallas
just outside of dallas
nice talking to you
what's that mean we're ready to go
okay well it the way it turned out it wasn't worth anything really i just don't think i've always thought that
it just wasn't carried on the way it should have been it wasn't carried on like a war i mean if we were in there to fight a war regardless of the reason we were there it should have been fought like a war it just
we
well i think we'd beat them i don't think
i don't know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the country within and with us but i think if we'd had allowed the military people to conduct it like a war
instead of letting the politicians and the
oh yes yeah i mean it was just a two bit country always was and always will be and or at least it is now and there's no way
that if we'd been able to take
use the capacity that we had the potential we had to fight a war against a country like that we would have what would have lost it as a war the long term effects well
i don't know that's a little tougher to answer i think
depends i guess on who's in office but i think bush used that last year in the persian gulf by taking some stronger measures and when the war started
be more or be more offensive well once the war started once they
once they decided to fight the thing we take a take a much
run in there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on i guess what happened back in vietnam is that they we escalated and just you know on a gradual basis and gave the
north vietnamese and viet cong time to adjust to our
increases in personnel and so forth they just didn't go in there if they'd a sent five hundred thousand troops in there at one time initially i think things would have been differently but different but it they went from
having the advisors up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of time a long a long number of years and as i said i think the
the enemy just gradually adjusted to that and
they didn't the people the country the people here didn't want the war the way it turned out they didn't want it that's
uh-huh
right
oh really
right well there are
yeah there were every night you'd come home from work and or school or whatever and see it on the news i
imagine that wasn't the case during world war two or any of the other wars people just didn't feel like they had the involvement in it and there were a lot of
a lot of
uh-huh
right
right yeah but i just
i guess i was in my let's see
my twenties during most of that war and i never did think that they were they were doing it right i i'm just not a fan of jane fonda and people like her i mean that she'd go around speaking on different campuses and
getting people aroused about the whole thing and of course they always talked about the vocal minority and i guess that's what it was the solid majority and the vocal minority and
people were listening to her and i guess politicians were too but i just felt
i was in the service at that time i wasn't over there but i just felt that they fought the thing i mean they just didn't fight it like they should have and it's a war whether a war is right or wrong you i mean if you're over there and
people or young people men or women are dying they ought to fight it as a war and
either win or lose based on the fact that it's a war and not just mealy mouth their way through the thing and try to get the other side to give up on the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth
oh yeah it would sure shorten the time and reduce the number of casualties and so forth we might have i just don't think we could have lost the
hm
yeah i have to agree i'm right now i'm in atlanta but i grew up and am from utica new york
so i understand and i agree with the new york situation
right
right
right
right
so they're not i don't think they're quite as bad as they are in new york state i guess is my opinion right now there is like there are there's a tax on food here which is you know a little bit different because they don't have that up there
and other than that right now they're starting to realize that their taxes are low
but they also realize that they still have to make sure their roads are paved and so on so they're starting to talk about raising like instead of registering or getting your license which costs five dollars now they decide to well maybe we should charge forty dollars for it
right
yeah
yeah that
right
of course
of course
no that seems like we're in from new york state i guess you're pretty much your main concern is yes you sit there and to allow you know taxes like crazy and all you do is see all the money go in a big funnel towards new york city
oh yeah um-hum yeah they've been talking about doing that here too but they haven't they've almost been able to push it through but people started complaining and
yeah
yeah
right
right
yeah
yeah that's down here they're i'm amazed at the one cheap thing down here is gas i'm not sure what the price is up there but that down here it's only like eighty nine cents per gallon
yeah i was home over at christmas break and it was i saw the gas prices and it was like boy what a switch
yeah
oh sure yeah
yep
well as soon as they get near memorial day people start traveling and everyone knows it so we've got to raise the gas prices
so
yes i know i and i just i actually had filed earlier and i got my refund tonight actually small but small but i got it back anyway
oh
oh yeah
yep
yeah well it's
pretty frustrating when you see the whole situation it doesn't seem as though
just close to richland college do you live in the area too
oh okay
hm
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
um-hum
well what kind of a house is it now are you still in a
oh okay
um-hum
right
oh we rent a duplex right now and it's only like a couple of miles from where i work it's a little bit further for my husband we used to both work at the same building at ti and it was only like two miles from the duplex
now he's moved but he's going against the flow of the traffic so it's not too bad of a commute it only takes him about fifteen minutes
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah and i think too now we both have little bit older cars i mean both our cars are over ten years old now if you get a house if you buy a house more for your money further out you're gonna have to have a pretty decent car and put a lot into
i mean you know if you've got to drive it sixty miles a day you're gonna go through that car a heck of a lot faster than what we did i mean that's not something people think about is the car the car payments and the gas
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
well i agree with the boredom of the election process but i also think that people don't realize that their boat vote will make a difference they feel like that
you know it's going to go however it's going to go and their one little vote's not going to make that much difference and it's just why make the effort
well i agree with that and i and i do know that you know all those votes are counted and they do make a difference
also i think that
people have a tendency to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the
the more local elections
exactly and i even have a tendency to do that myself and i have to really make a concerted effort to get involved i lived i live in a suburb in mesquite
and so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what's going to because that directly affects me but i think on the whole most people don't
feel that way or don't look even look at that i think they just don't even
i don't think they're conscious of it
well that may be true too i hadn't thought of that
um-hum
right
and sometimes it's
well not sometimes but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign and
and issues get bogged down
i think voter awareness i did some work for the women's league of
voters several years ago
and i think there are some organizations that used to do some voter awareness things they don't get a lot of participation they don't get a lot of
activity most of the league of women voters
what they did was they put out information
so that it would just be made available to everyone now other areas that i've worked in like in the chambers they would just have the candidates come and it would just you know that was not a lot of community involvement and those were people that would mostly vote anyway
it's a it's an ongoing campaign and it's expensive campaign and it eliminates a lot of qualified people
maybe more qualified and more dedicated
to the issues
exactly
exactly and it
i can't i just can't believe i've worked in a couple of local campaigns
i just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally
oh well i agree with that
but also and i and i'm not for
controlling how much is spent but do you know
that's one thing if a if the time wasn't so
if it wasn't such a long campaigning time
then
they couldn't spend as much money
no they really don't
it's a lot of it is who looks the best
who
who happens to say the right thing at the right time who not it who may not be
exactly
and it's a it's a i've worked in public relations a lot and
that kind of thing can make and break make or break you as you can
campaign
it really was and it's just
he possibly could have won that election had it not been for some of the
the way he presented himself
hoof is i guess the right term for
well let me see well the most my favorite ones are kind of an old author edgar rice burroughs
and he had a series of called john carter of mars i don't know if you're familiar with it or not but he's the one that wrote tarzan of the apes and all that too and
then i like what else do i have there oh it's a series of another fantasy but it's fred saberhagen and it's the it's the sword series which i liked and gore i like too it's another fantasy one
and starting i think i'm going to start pick up a few more science fiction as far as well as isaac asimov have a number of his books too and h g wells
yeah but i think they're pretty good and then i'm i think i'm going to start picking up some of the newer star treks because i hear they're pretty good too
oh really
do you know which one was it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh well i sort of read mostly in high school and you know and i and i like it you know as the light reading and everything and i recently completed graduate school and i've really kind of got interested
through a number a couple of classes that i took there on history and stuff and i've gotten a number of history books but i haven't read any yet you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah and what which ones do you like
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i've got those as far as humor i've got a couple of irma bombecks too
do you
yeah they're pretty funny because it's really kind of interesting and those are kind of neat too and i've read i like steve well i like some of stephen king
i can't even think of his
the books of blood and cable i guess how you say just you know some paperbacks and stuff
oh did you
yeah
and then of course i've read the
clancy books
you know hunt for red october and red storm riding rising
well actually you know red storm i haven't i've started red storm rising but i really recommend hunt for red october
because it really it's good and it keeps going pretty quick but the red storm rising i've heard and then it's been apparent the first you know few pages or whatever it's kind of slow in starting and everything
but it's not a bad book at all
yeah actually i got an old copy of moby dick that i like too i read a while back
uh-huh
oh you hadn't two was really good because he quoted a lot from moby dick
no i didn't
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
john irving yeah
yeah oh yeah that's good
yeah
yeah that's pretty much the way it is usually i try to i have some a book or two by the bed and then maybe like i get to read for twenty minutes before i go to sleep or something
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah jaws actually have you read the first one the book
rick
well as a person living in one of the areas that's got both the one of the most restrictive set of laws and one of the highest murder rates in the country
i happen to be an opponent of gun control
i happen to be
kind of funny of course i had a radical turn around in my attitude about that about four or five years ago
and along with some other political what do you call it
changes too i formerly was one of your typical new york left wingers
uh-huh well we're not all like that
about a year ago i engaged in the arduous six month prices process of getting a fire arms license
and
not long after that my wife engaged in a similar process and now when we get a chance which is entirely too infrequently we can go down to the range and shoot together
all right where you are you can go to sears right
really yeah
yeah you know the stores are here but it's you know you walk in and i'd like to look at that okay fine let me see your paperwork
it's kind of funny because we are going out to california in a while and out there you can walk into apparently there are ranges where they rent which is something that to me is completely foreign
but i may get a chance to try out some things i've never tried out before
ah
um-hum
yeah
for rifle and shotgun you've got to sign the federal form but that's about it
and i really don't know where they stand on semiautomatics these days
they've been getting a lot of bad press
it's
sounds fair
uh-huh well you know it you know it's kind of interesting you say that because we had a series about a year and a half ago
of murders here four within the space of about two months
and the profile of all of them was
a couple got separated the guy had menacing the his ex-wife
they filed the court order to keep him away he got picked up once or twice and then the last time he didn't get picked up he just came in there and killed the woman
and there were four of these within a couple of months and nobody seems to connect with the idea that
you know there are you know maybe just maybe she could've had a better shot at it if she'd been armed
you know at
i don't think so i think that there made a strangulation or stabbing in there you know i don't know the specifics but
you know it what was that
oh my wife is screaming shotgun
what do you call we had
maybe this is fundamentally my attitude changing
when he pointed out that the purpose of the police was not to prevent crime
and his comment was
well in order to prevent a crime the police have to be where the crime is taking place now they can't be everywhere they can be very good at deterring crime
they can be very good capturing criminals and enforcing the punishment of crime but they can't be good at preventing it
so if the police aren't going to prevent it who is
and i thought it was you know a very nice elegant piece of logic there and it's absolutely true you know it
you know so and i imagine the more rural you get that the truer that is
you know kind of funny i was just looking at a book today where some fellow was his car had been stolen
and he was screaming at the police primarily because about two days before you know they were telling him we're spread to thin to enforce car theft and a few days before they'd given him a ticket for parking fifteen minutes late at a meter
yeah but
as a matter of fact
card carrying it's about i think it was renewed for the second or third time
and
yeah it's interesting of course one of the things that
yeah i don't know
yeah
uh-huh
oh really yeah that's pretty awesome too i watch it every now and then that's hilarious
oh serious
oh that's cool
uh-huh
twilight zone rules man twilight zone rules
that's all
are you serious
oh he just like totally sarcastic and hilarious and i don't know i'm a lot like him in a way so
and he's got curly hair and so do i so
cool how long is it
that's hilarious
no it with the who was on the music people wasn't that fishbone yeah i saw that it was awesome but i didn't see the rest of it
are you serious they're awesome
oh really
yeah that sucks
really kind of annoying but that's cool
kind of annoying to like in front of tv like trying to do homework you know
trying to write an essay you start talking about you know like
in living color or something i don't know
cool yeah bs that's the way to do it
cool yeah works for me
no unless
i watched through the war you know there's only one
i know i guess they think that people don't watch tv but i mean if you watch it like five minutes then it repeats the same thing over and over and over
it's like oh man
yeah
oh
yeah
i haven't seen it in years but i used to
yeah
uh-huh
really
oh really that's cool
uh-huh
are you serious oh man
that's cool
kind of like pink floyd or something
yeah basketball's cool but football kind of after a while
which basketball yeah i kind of like college better it's more spirited
oh yeah
cool
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh me too
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that's true
yeah that's true
oh really
oh really so why from argentina why'd you come over here
oh that's cool how long did you live there
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
huh
that's cool
oh really awesome
that's cool
groovy
yeah no doubt
okay
yeah you too
bye
okay well i guess you're pretty aware that it's been a little warm for this time of year
it the humidity's a little higher
uh-huh you know about a month from now this wouldn't be so bad but boy for the end of march this is this is funny
oh jeez
well that's a good way to look at it
well if you do that then you'll only be pleasantly surprised probably if it's anything but that
that's
but i guess the winter wasn't that bad down here really
yeah looking forward to a really bad summer and hot summer
well hopefully you know if it's humid now maybe it'll i remember last year it rained an awful lot or you know for the last couple of years it's rained an awful lot and maybe that'll help to defeat some of the heat
and if it rains a lot
but
oh yeah you're right yeah i used to live in up north up in the upper midwest and
and we had mosquito problems that's for sure
oh really
well you know it's that easy to say but boy when it's when it's forty below and you're shoveling snow and it's forty below it's
does it go in any where north of the red river
that's i that's what i've heard people say is they'll never go north of the red river again
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i know what you mean because you got to have like little oil heaters where they plug in the plug in your car
and that's not that's not good at all and
well i guess i guess the only thing to do is to hope that this is the worse that it gets this year
yeah or if it if it does get worse it doesn't stay for very long
oh that's right that's right because
already hit oklahoma and probably right down here soon so
yeah
um-hum
um-hum get a northerner through here
that's right
no
no it's
yeah and i guess that's shows what they say about dallas if you don't like the weather just wait a day yeah it'll change on you
um-hum
uh-huh
well anyway i guess that's about all i got to say about the weather
okay
talk about it but can't do anything about it okay
all right bye-bye
um-hum
yeah that's certainly helpful
staying within state i realize that there are a lot of schools unless the student has a real specialty
and there oh maybe are one or two universities that are highly respected in that field they really ought to try to stay within their state i mean
financing in universities now is getting a very high
and they can't help themselves on that either so it certainly is an advantage to stay within your own state
yeah
um-hum
that's very important
well that was certainly good advice to get him to go to a school who follows up and has such a reputation that others are happy to get their students that
and that's good for him too regardless of where he works he has a top level of information that will last him the rest of his life basically
um-hum
and the field i worked in was acoustics
and we have an acoustics department here and have lots of students several hundred i guess in acoustics and they have an excellent opportunity to
follow through on their fields because our university is well known for it's research in addition to teaching obviously if we can do
high class research we must be well trained and available to teach the students well
yes
yes
yes because penn state is very well known in many of its of its fields and
we get a lot we do we only we get our sort of say we get state students not only from out of state but from all over the world
i mean they really come here we have a very high percentage of foreign students because penn state is pretty well tops in many of its fields
and we have doubled in size in the last fifteen twenty years i guess
um-hum
yes that's true
yes and then the basic thing is that you started out earlier to say the bottom line is to give your
across the country on a crime spree
thelma and louise yeah
yeah it really is it's interesting
oh yeah i enjoyed
oh this is the just the one oh gosh it was the city slickers right have you seen that
uh-huh
yeah i i've heard lots of good things about it and i would have would have liked to have seen it but i was with my wife and i figured she'd like thelma and louise better so
and i'd heard it was really good too so
yeah
okay
uh-huh
yeah there's been a fair number of pretty good movies out recently
yeah
what kind of movies in general do you like to watch
um-hum
no in fact i'm not even familiar with it i don't think
uh-huh
mission
hm
um-hum
actually yeah my wife's from down in that region around the called the seven missions which are which are right down in this where i'm sure where it was filmed at
and i'm sure that would make it worth her watching she my movie watching has severely has changed a lot since i got married
yeah she likes action movies and comedies and so anything that's has anything little is a little bit less than sort of mainstream hollywood is
and i find i don't do it anymore or else i have to watch them on my own
find something both of you will watch
yeah
she it's funny because i mean most women aren't really sort of she's sort of schwarzenegger fan type of yeah she really likes all these gory shoot them up films
keep her on the edge of her seat
i'll watch them you know they're kind of fun to watch in a way
you know which most women won't come within ten feet of
echo
yeah i mean for some people that's just you know that's out of the question you know if you give it subtitled they won't watch it
well longer term trends i think that like past oh ten or fifteen years
there seems to be a
trend and maybe it's longer than that of politics is strictly a what can i get for me or what can i get for my group and not what's
best for the whole kind of a thing does that make any sense or
i mean the
yeah political action committees that and i think it i think it ties in with the budget deficit that the
congress and is they get reelected by what they do for their districts in terms of bringing in and bringing in money and
in order to bring in money for their district they've got to vote to spend it in other districts and the heck with the overall deficit and
districts is geographical but it can just as well be interest groups in terms of
whether it's social security or anything that it's what you get for your constituents one way or another not what what's necessarily good overall
yeah
yeah
like texas yeah
yeah
yeah okay but
yeah
yeah
yeah
yep
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well
well i guess i guess i'm a little more cynical than that i'm not i'm not sure that it that all of it has to be done even but
but well in
well i
but i mean in terms of not necessarily all the planes that the government buys they really need or not necessarily well in particular planes and i
you know i see this here in texas that got
oh i can't even remember which of the companies it is but they've got a they've got a tilt rotor
plane that they've developed and they want to but developed for the defense -partment and defense department is saying well no we don't we don't really need it it's going to be too expensive and it's not going to do what we need and
the texas people are fighting to have it built for just to just to keep and create jobs here
yeah
no
yep
right
yeah
yep
i think maybe so and i think that or
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right you know that's true too but do you see any other trends or particularly interesting events that come to your mind
yeah
yeah
well i certainly did when he first did it but i haven't heard about it for a while i was at are
can't yeah
huh
yeah
yep
yeah
uh-huh
how do you how is recycling done in your community is
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
oh
right over here they have several private companies that you can take recycled materials to
but if you want to take them all to one place they have the first saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off that's what i do
and i recycle aluminum glass
newspapers
so it's nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place and
right
right so it's so that's nice it would be it would be really nice if they came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in tucson about that but
it didn't go through
so
right i guess what they what they were talking about here was
was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know
so i guess that's one option
i guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too like
have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is
yeah i guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler
yeah so now they're like marking they're i don't know there's six seven eight different kind of plastics and they mark on the bottom what kind it is
so i guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're
they're trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that makes it easier i guess
right
where does your friend go to recycle
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i guess that's how it gets passed on you know when one person you hear it from another person and then
and then you and then you pass it on so it seems to be catching on
uh-huh
wow that's neat that's neat yeah when you
well when you start early i
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh well i work at ti and they don't really have dress code so to speak there it's pretty lax about you know we you can pretty much wear whatever you want to
and i wear anything from jeans when i'm feeling really casual to suits and dresses when i'm meeting with a customer or i teach training classes
and so when i'm teaching a class obviously i wear a suit or dress so
it definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is and when it's raining i'm more likely to wear jeans and when it's really cold i'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing
but it just really depends on the weather and my mood and then you know obviously when i'm doing anything that i'm in front of people or making presentations teaching whatever i'm going to dress up more
uh-huh
uh-huh
there are a few people every now and then that wear those to work there pretty strict about that though i've never worn i just wouldn't i mean even to well jeans aren't exactly professional but for some reason a mini skirt is
to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans just because it's maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything but you just feel like you're being
showing too much i don't know i wouldn't want to wear a mini skirt to work i have seen a few people do it though but they weren't overly and they weren't overly revealing they were pretty much in good taste but for me i just
i just wouldn't want to do that
uh-huh that's what i've seen
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
well i feel like too on the job when you know there's men around and some of the managers are men you just
you know you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily and to me i just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes i like to have a just a little something that's feminine
not you know you don't want to over do it but just a little a touch of it just to say yes i am a woman but i can be professional too
right uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right that's what i one thing i like about ti is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear and they don't
you know your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit i mean they leave it up to you and your judgment to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have
the only real restrictions they have are no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the split skirts anything that could be considered shorts they don't allow and they don't allow
any sweat any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or you know anything like that on it but
other than that it's pretty lax and i think that's good because it does allow people to be individual and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day or you know if you want to be comfortable and casual you can and sometimes i think you
may be more productive if you're comfortable with what your wearing and can be feel more relaxed whereas
sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and you're not you know maybe you don't can't get as comfortable to sit down and you know like when i'm writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day
so that's i think that is good that they're like that i do know there's a lot of companies that are very
strict about what the employees wear and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and you know no variation and i don't i don't quite agree with that
right
yeah
uh-huh
right i agree
well it i guess we've talked probably long enough nice talking to you too i enjoyed it bye-bye
i do yes i guess it actually changes i do a number of different things simply walking with my wife and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle
and then moving up i run in the mornings not every morning it probably averages about two days a week
and then with my wife i actually go to the gym and lift weights which isn't i understand quite exercising but it's along the lines
how about yourself
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
that's right
right so you look at it more as a as a task
right
i see
right so i'm thirty two years old which is probably different than yourself
and so it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise in my job at texas instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so
that i don't get any exercise doing that and plus there's a build up of stress so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner and i need to go out in the morning and run or i'll just get nuts
so that's kind of a motivator so even though i can look at it as a task
the you know i kind of get the i get some kind of global benefit from the from the whole thing by saying well i'm you know lowering my chance of heart attack and thus that type stuff
sure that all i do all that
yeah
right
going to the gym is actually something different than the like oh and the running and i enjoy that too year i've been running since high school you know on track teams and the like so
running i i'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more
and you don't think about the pain of it you take the time to relax some how and you think about other things during those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that and that's no fun and it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people
yeah the weight lifting on the other hand is actually you know i think i look better
i have just a i don't i'm not a huge person i'm just a regular looking guy but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is attractive
so that pays also
yeah so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work the with my wife which is nice i love her you know i enjoy being with her i guess that's one thing but also that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles
yeah
but
oh yeah i don't i don't let that bother me but yeah that that's something that comes with time too you know i'll tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent
you know it's your own you you're struggling against your own body weight
you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow and you can actually get a good you can
i know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups
oh is that right
right
yeah
right
that's funny
yeah
yeah
well you know maybe not i'd say i'd say at twenty two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting the exercise otherwise
when your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle between
and that's the hard decision is okay if i'm going to run in the mornings what am i what do i trade it off for well the answer's sleep right if i'm going to walk at night what do i trade it off for well star trek
or you know it it's always trade-offs and you actually have to as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to replace this thing it's i mean not just exercise but anything it's very hard
and so i don't i don't think you should worry about not having a program yet
yep
yeah i guess if you care or if your wife your future wife gives you a reason to care which helps
nice talking with you craig
you too good day bye
how many you said yours are all i mean that sounds like an army
oh lord
that is an army i came from a family of six
and i have only got two and they're one
well i kind of decided that single children that
that's not parenting that's a hobby but
well i can i can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day and when i take care of some people's kids you know when they when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends' kids
that are usually in day care and you can spot them because they have no idea how to just hang out and mess around
yeah really
it's not a problem for my two they're only eighteen months apart
they can
they can find things to do and mess around and
plot and scheme and everything else so you did all five of yours complete college
well how did you go about selecting a college then
uh-huh
uh-huh
how about the other four other three who went
uh-huh
when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes i went four years undergrad at university of nebraska at lincoln because lincoln is where my parents lived and there really
there really wasn't a choice i mean the finances dictated that you had to go there
i kind of i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the rhodes scholars kids and the whole bit
my parents didn't even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known
how not i'm not going to say easy but how
much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a
would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the harvard university in boston and that was i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was
taken out of my element you know the homogeneous midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently
different life style and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me
i don't know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we're putting money away already but i really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to
you know them getting an education they really need a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in especially if you lived a pretty insular community and
an upper class suburb of dallas let me tell you
it's very different
you shouldn't
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
well
that's something yeah we have it's a very timely subject i think in the spring everybody decides that they're going to start over and do something with their house
and we started last year an we have a little i guess it's a sixteen hundred foot house and it's just my husband and i here but we decided that we wanted to build a sun room
and it's a good thing we got a contractor i mean this is not something you need to do by yourself so we ended up with a contractor and went through that whole schmeal with
the contractor saying one thing and then doing another and anyway we ended up with a really neat sun room on the back of the house it's beautiful it's like two hundred square foot
but that's not something we did by ourselves if you talk about home repairs tom's real good at mowing the grass and doing the garden so that's about it
isn't that amazing
yeah
yeah
all those little details that you don't really understand you know like we had some water leaks in the well in the sun room there was a part that was fiberboard
and you know tape and bed over that and when it did rain of course the only way to tell if this place leaks is to see if what happens after it rains
it's a chore and a half without tearing the whole thing out and repainting and doing everything again
oh
yeah
it
but you do
oh i know because every time they send somebody out they have to take them off a crew that's making money doing a job and they have to send them back to you where they're not making any money trying to repair something that you know should have been right in the first place
yeah
well i was real happy with our contractor actually i wasn't happy with the contractor i was happy with the job foreman so i think that made all the difference because he was pretty you know
concerned about how it looked and you know how it should be done the right way and he gave us a lot of clues you just wish you knew all this stuff going in that
it was funny because we didn't understand a lot of things that we had to do in addition to this you know like the tape and bedding and doing finishing off this wall and that wall that wasn't in the contract you know kind of thing
so that was kind of interesting
oh neat
oh
yeah
yeah well we've taken this another step further this year we're going to build a deck we've got some people building a deck out in the back you know to complete sort of the back yard kind of thing and
oh yeah
oh
uh-huh
okay
i was wondering about that yeah
uh-huh
you soaked it
oh yeah
the color is what you're yeah sometimes after
yeah those and so they're not going to split and i was really concerned about bugs really when i when we were considering other types of wood because you know termites can be a real hazard around here
yeah
um-hum
that
yeah that's the end part that's where you know get the
that's the part we have to do we got that up front we figured it out you know we need to know what we need to do that's not included in this and that's one of the details but that's fine as long as they tell you
it's so funny because tom is getting more and more adept at doing things it's just things like painting just always used to really scare me he didn't know where to start you know with a paint can you know an
it sure is
um-hum
oh and do the water seal floor
uh-huh
okay
i got you covered there
and that's just a water sealing and what happens if they aren't water sealed
yeah will deteriorate yeah
yeah
yeah they did tell us that we'd have to you know every couple of years just you know do brush up on the color
um-hum
oh really
huh
yeah he suggested just getting a mop like you would use
a mop
paint it yeah
uh-huh
you couldn't tell oh
it is i
well like i said tom does great with his garden i always enjoyed working on the crew in the plays and building stuff so i'm really in infatuated with building things and
and making things
but there's nothing like getting a perfect
well actually about six months ago we were but it was kind of a different type deal we had a large conversion van that and we're looking to sell it too
oh yeah as a matter of fact the reason we sold the van was just so that my wife could stay home with our two boys now
so we got rid of that big payment and so now she's a stay at home mom
it did fairly well for me i got about fifteen sixteen
in the that's combination city and highway driving and then on the open road i can get about nineteen or twenty
hum-um yeah you would think it'd be a lot worse i know mini vans don't get much better than that they get about twenty one twenty two
yeah
ah
ah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i have looked at some of the toyota makes a real nice van i like theirs a lot
but if you really want size you know the prices are about the same depend you know you can spend as much on a mini van as you do on a full size conversion van
and the difference is the conversion of course the mileage is a little bit worse
but because you do have a bigger engine and bigger transmission you can pull stuff like trailers and boats and stuff easier than you can with a you know the other mini van
oh
um-hum
oh yeah just lots and lots of vans
um-hum
oh it doesn't yeah
um-hum
yeah well i don't know if you'd be how old is your oldest
eight yeah see i don't know how long you'd be happy like that
well i don't know how often all six of you all will be in the car but i know that once you get one or two car seats in there
ah and then that yeah then you'd have your eight year old you'd probably have your eight year old up front on the bench seat
but even then after a while you'd feel cramped especially if it was ah you know a fairly long trip in more than about an hour
oh yes definitely you know a station wagon the back end of a station wagon probably can carry as much as a van but as for passenger space
ah you can't beat a van because you can you can you can carry seven in a van and that's a mini van
on a large conversion van you can you know you can carry a lot you can carry about nine
well because for what i wanted in a van the mini vans were about a thousand dollars less
and you get almost twice the room in the conversion van than you do in the mini van
plus like i said all the extra pulling power and i didn't feel i was losing that much on gas mileage because they're not that far off
yeah it was a new one uh-huh
yeah i mean i was really surprised
because when you know you can like pick dodge for instance they got two sizes of mini vans one's the extra long and then the other the extra long option with all the power options you know windows locks and the nice stereo
it was only about fifteen hundred less than the comparable full size van
and you know like i said the mileage on a mini van is about oh twenty one twenty two on the highway and on the you know on the full size it was nineteen twenty
and that's nothing yeah so you know i said you know given that i said
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh yeah
hm
where is it
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i was gonna say that
i know i've seen it somewhere
what is it is it what's it like just good food
um-hum
value and taste
uh-huh
um-hum
i would love that i mean but you know that's what
except for the type of food that's kind of what i like
and i work downtown and so there are a lot around here and in
oh you know like the knox central you know on the border i like for one kind of food and then there's the holes in the wall i like for another type
and but what i look for is cost and yeah well i don't i don't know i don't like noisy restaurants either i that's why i don't go to on the border that much
yep and
and
i mean it's just i don't know it's a cavern you know it's just because it's so big and tall and a big room of full of lots of people or what
really i've heard they're good
um-hum
oh yeah
extras and oh
so it's good yeah
that's what i like cheap and then but i but do you like to go out or do you eat at mcdonald's a lot or stuff like that
or yeah
right
yeah
no i don't but
so you've kind of got to go there for playing for the kids and not for you
yeah
oh
good pizza i love pizza but i usually order that pizza is what i usually order you know at the house deliver it to me
and anything but domino's
oh that's wonderful i've had their food before
i don't know that we have any big one down where i live in east dallas so it's
over by white rock lake
and
i don't know how much i know about this subject
yeah
okay go ahead
that's true
me either i
i went to college and then started working and then got married and
no i haven't i know that my sister i have a twin sister and when she graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south texas and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in
a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever
um-hum
if it's like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to you know to live
yeah she only taught there one year but i
um-hum
and i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who he is in like the therapy type thing and he was
some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at
i mean it's a nursing home or something like that so you know if i think that that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping
people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want
yeah
as far as yeah getting doctors and all that kind of stuff yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
i really don't know that much about it you know i think of the peace corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when but yeah and don't they go into other countries and stuff
um-hum
things that make yeah make them more self-supporting yeah
right yeah
but it definitely would give
a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see
what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it
um-hum
yeah
i don't i don't know that you could require everyone to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that i don't know that would work if somebody's
was didn't really want to be there and
didn't have yeah i mean there'd be loopholes just like there is in anything else
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right yeah
yeah um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
well
and here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped
yeah
and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and
help people in that area or people in the united states
there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be
half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that it's everybody's responsibility
money or
what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give
more money to these people i mean and that's not really the answer i mean because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that but
or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves i mean
i guess we're getting kind of off the subject here but yeah i mean it's
true yeah
yeah
flower mound yeah
so we're a little
you know farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing
yes
i try to whenever i can i've always been a i guess a product of a handyman father
yeah
right yeah
yes one of my first cars was a fifty six buick which after awhile i could you know take it apart in my sleep if i needed to
yeah it got to be pretty straightforward to understand and since then you know the closer a car is to a fifty six buick the more i know about it and then start getting into these nissans and the like and i just can't keep up
yeah
yep
um-hum
yes
yes i understand my last car repair actually had to do with brakes and it's one i did not do myself i took the car my i have a seventy nine el dorado took it to be inspected
and the parking brake failed so i got under there and messed with the that adjustment to make tighten it up and that didn't do the trick and i got there and tried to
but we well actually that wasn't even eventually the problem i did a lot of things that i did everything that i could think to do
and eventually i brought it up to a place called just brakes and it turns out that there's a the parking brake in the rear there's a there's disc brakes and the parking brake is a piston
deal and because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years the piston froze up so they ended up having to pound it out and one of them they
were able to get running kind of oiling it and playing with it and the other one they just it was just frozen solid so i ended up having to buy one and all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done
yeah
yep that's right
i grew up in well at that time i was in a trenton new jersey so and it was a suburb of trenton so i really had mixture of suburb and urban living
yeah
i think you're right it's interesting i'm i work in a high school
so i'm comparing my life when i was in high school thirty years ago to what i see these children doing
and the pressures on the children you know you hear this as an excuse but it's true they are so much greater
oh i cannot believe what they're doing academically the demands on them
and i can see why children do drop out
i can see i can see you know
uh-huh
and then you didn't you didn't have to lock your door
and a and some of these are urban worries but
it's a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now in this area
things were similar because twenty years ago let's see it was after
yeah twenty five years ago is when we had the washington riots the first rights we've been having some problem now and it reminded me of that
uh-huh
whereabouts
uh-huh
uh-huh
the washington riots weren't because i lived right downtown washington and what you saw is was what you got i'm telling you
yeah but you know it's it is interesting they're so many they're different kind of dangers that face young people now
and social pressures the pressures of drug is so much the prevalence is so much greater the kinds of diseases that you've got out the
i mean the consequences is so much what's going on is so much more serious
then when we were younger
uh-huh
yes and
uh-huh
that's true
i also being involved in the school system see so many of problem children coming from their parents
children who will lie and cheat and you approach their parents and their parents are constantly justify them rather than to
if you're not going to get reinforced by that at home
and you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day what's not been done for fifteen or sixteen years at home
and you're get you get mixed signals so it's not always the school's systems
i think a lot of it is the families and
the way you were mentioning yeah
yeah
course life is a lot more complicated too in ways
the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now
you know with farming being so mechanized people working on the family farm which was a traditional american way
if that becomes less and less likely factory jobs are so much more sophisticated
and the kinds of knowledge that you know it it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force and some people just don't have it it's
and you worry with you know the effects of
the effect of drugs on the young children and the unborn children
it certainly is
well it sure is
it sure is
it was a little easier though wasn't it
that's
yes
yeah
and they all the things demanded of the mother too i mean i look at my mother's life
i mean she didn't work for a long time when i was very young she didn't drive
that's right
that's right that's right
they need you more as a teenager
isn't that true that's why i'm working in a school system so that i'm home when they're home
that's isn't that that's so true i find working in a high school
it's very helpful because it let's me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do
and it keeps me from being the old foggy but at the same time it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes
as to what's come but that's the same i'm home at the summers i'm home with the holidays
i'm home at three o'clock when the children are at home or where home one is now a senior in high school and the other's in college
and it's it does it
uh-huh
that's right
well i'm
that's that is that is so true and it's not that always that the children always say something but every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment
and you realize it's important that
well
linda lee uh-huh
and your name was
well i enjoyed talking with you
okay bye-bye
hello
marilyn it's angela
how funny
push one
uh-huh
yes
soap opera digest is one
and
two mainly
yeah well it was a special thing it i think it was like a free subscription
that you got to see if you'd like the magazine and you would renew it at the end of it i never did but
but we take consumer
yeah i consumer digest
now we do like that one
it has all different kinds of tips on
like appliances and tv's and vcr's and cars
just different things that you buy and what the latest items are out and stuff it it's real informative
and then people magazine
um-hum
yeah i'd forgotten
yeah they're i've bought it a couple of times that or one of the other ones like that one you know after reading the front page there will be something that just catches my eye and i'll go ahead and buy it
because sometimes like you said not all of it is believable and if you use your own judgment you can usually decipher what is and what's not
do
yeah i don't i don't buy
i don't buy then at the store either i can't even remember the last time i bought one at the grocery store in a long time
right
what don't you like about the magazines
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i
i don't like all the advertisements and some sometimes it seems like the magazines are full of more
advertisements than they are anything else
i don't either it's just you have to turn all those pages to get finally to the story you were reading
when it's interrupted
but i like people magazine too
yeah it is getting real expensive
yeah or get somebody in the neighborhood to do it and then everybody pass it through
uh-huh
they didn't renew their subscription because of that
uh-huh
yeah well i think we're just going to do like you said just take the ones at the newsstand that look interesting from now on because seventy five dollars for a magazine that's just that's too much that's
yeah
i don't think people have time to read them anymore
it's just usually the newspapers and
and then they're off doing their own thing
weekends and stuff are pretty full and that's about the only time
people seem to read on the weekends
because mainly i i'm like you i read books
more
um-hum
i don't know i'm i just i don't i'm not that interested in the magazines it you know other than like people or this consumer digest and the reason why we got that one was
maybe the other one there's one out that's that has to do with financial things like how to save money and what bonds and insurancers and stuff like that to buy that we've got we had a
sample subscription to that one and that one was good too it had a the one that was a sample one had an article in there about college
saving for your children and what to do and what not to do and how much the projected cost was going to be by the time like you know mine reached college age and stuff
and it's going to be pretty darn expensive and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting
yeah like those e-bonds there's something called an e-bond that you can buy and it and it you don't have to pay taxes on it and it's for the child and then when they turn it in when it
real mess i guess you must say
oh yeah think
probably i guess it's pretty well wide spread nation wide but i think texas probably
the major or a good portion of it
that makes two of us
the major culprit with the oil crisis
right
yeah i guess that was the immediate cause
shoot i don't i tell you one thing as far as the way they're handling it i
i feel pretty strongly about this and that's i think they're over reacting as far as the actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers
i think they went way to far the other way in the spectrum
and on the other hand i don't
know whether they're doing enough in the way of you know redressing the situation and bringing the real
you know the
the presidents of the banks and those people that are really responsible to justice on that
i'm not sure i didn't
yeah it's going to be
it's your and my money that's doing that you know that's unfortunately
yeah
yeah well i guess the hope is that they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to help get them out of it
that's a good point they
they got a little
a little hesitation in the recovery here and hopefully they'll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time
uh-huh
let's see what were some of the other
other points she mentioned topic wise
it seems to me like they really haven't at least they haven't
if they're doing anything it's still pretty much not out in the open it's you know behind the scenes kind of
panels or whatever you know committees or investigations
nothing
nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i don't think
yeah
does tend to push that out of the front page
yeah this will be a first i usually end up getting told i got three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds or something like that
yeah i think one time it was i think ten minutes was the maximum and another time it was ended by
its capacity was short that day or something
i don't think there is a i don't know if there is a minimum
so i'm satisfied we covered the topic on this end
nice talking with you
bye-bye
right
right
for a larger number than just their own personal safety
yeah
huh
right
right and the same goes with you can eat poppy bagels poppy seeds
and they'll come up as a as a positive for drugs as well
which is i you know i'd just heard that just recently and i thought that was interesting
yeah i do i have a little problem with somebody testing for drugs just in general as an invasion of privacy
but i do agree with you regarding people that deal with groups of other people that their lives should be they should feel a little more safe and there should be more of a safeguard
you know air traffic controllers airline pilots anybody that deal with the public in a
uh-huh
right
within the community
yeah
that's
right yep
well did you hear about the what was happening in the boston area
for i guess for about the past five they've been testing babies for aids
but not releasing the information
they were just testing to find out how prevalent it is in what demographic and segments of the population
but they weren't telling anybody if they did it when the results came up positive or negative they weren't telling anybody
well i'm sure and also bringing light to the fact that they weren't getting parental permission for it
they were just doing this test
yep
yep
right
exactly they want to they want to be just above in that regard
no
yep
well there's a standard joke about the northwestern pilots
yeah
hm
no right i had a for many years i had a dog that was part springer spaniel i just love them
loved her she was the greatest went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle
just i got him he was he was born in the wild like in a in a shed
and had never been in a building when i got him so he and he's he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because he's very long and lanky but he's a very tame spoiled house cat you know now that i've had him for seven years
really big so lots of times he it he seems to get in fights and when he was younger i think he started them and now i think he barely makes it i think he gets beat up even though he's big because he's
pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then yeah
oh i've seen them i
yeah i just i think i'm i think i'm being accurate in the in the area of folklore but i'm not sure
yeah
yeah
yeah okay
hm
okay right now we're living in well it's me my wife and two young boys
and right now we're in a i guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home
which you might call it so we don't have a big yard but when my wife and i first moved in it was just the two of us so it was enough
and it's i guess what they call a story and a half because it's not a full two story
where you know everything on top is on bottom
so it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings
and it's about a five year old house now
yeah
that's true
exactly what happened to them
oh that's nice
oh really are you doing it yourself
wow
oh that's nice
oh i see
oh
that's great
is that so i didn't know that
that sounds kind of dumb
hm
yeah
hm
yeah that's true
um-hum that's good
yeah
how big a lot do you got it on
wow that's nice that's real nice
oh
that's pretty good
um-hum
yeah
yeah
oh that's pretty good
uh-huh
oh you don't plan on putting any of that in
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
wow
yeah that's pretty good
yeah
wow
she loves lots of windows
is it a single story
oh i see
um-hum
i see
oh
yeah
um-hum
yeah i i've always liked that the you know i we don't have much yard but i built a small deck in the back but you know i see these magazines where you know do your own decks
i kind of wish i had them the size property and
okay
well what's your favorite tv program
uh-huh
hm
i tape it and watch it the next day yes
right
well that they're doing it saturday nights now um-hum
ten thirty
hm for an hour i mean
glued to i watch some of the anthologies if they've got something interesting on like masterpiece theatre or
mystery or something like that yeah
yes we saw we saw several of those not all of them
only the new one i never really was interested in the old one and so but i like the cast of the new one so that's what we watch
saturdays
um-hum
true that's true i i'm a very selective watcher i look at the tv section and
let things catch my eye
oh yes
oh yes and also i don't know how old they are but there's nickelodeon
oh well they would enjoy that
um-hum so would i
i wouldn't admit it to anybody normally
i mean forty here twenty years later you understand yes because he's he plays the phantom of the opera now and
i like old movies i love musicals
um-hum
um-hum right
oh i know
i know i keep a little a little a little library and if i get stuck i can resort to my little library in all sorts of things
it's surprising with all the choice we have sometimes there's no choice
i don't know i got kicked off the other day because they said the lines were busy
me too me too and you keep on watching for those old movies
all right all right bye-bye
right
okay
yeah
right
uh-huh
oh okay
that's interesting i've never heard of the news letters angle i'm also an all things considered person weekend edition whatever
i generally enjoy it although sometimes they have a tendency to do twenty minute features on things i'd just had soon not hear for about two minutes
yeah
yeah exactly
yeah although i think that's probably true of most news coverage in general good news isn't news right
right
yeah on television or radio
yep oh excuse me i was just going to say up here they broadcast that i think between five am and six am which is a little before i get up so i usually miss it
right
yeah like you i rarely spend time watching news on tv the
i gave up on network news years ago and it just doesn't usually work out i have time to watch something more in depth like mcneil lehrer so
for me it's pretty much a diet of
all things considered and i like to look at the wall street journal at work which i think does a fine job it too has a slant but
yeah exactly and
yeah i think what is it the fourth column of page one is kind of famous in it's own right just for human interest stories or business interest stories i
um-hum
right back to square one
yeah and that's the kind of thing the journal does best i find i don't have time to read through the whole thing certainly but i find if you
i think there's something to that yeah i tend to agree
well i remember now it's been quite a few years since my kids were in high school i'm getting that old but i remember being a little surprised at the
the catalog of courses like instead of taking a survey course on american literature you had you chose from it almost looked like a college catalog
and the courses were too specialized as you said
you'd be about the same age as my sons yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i taught college for awhile not recently but
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i guess the class sizes are bigger now i guess they must be
uh-huh
no
right they need smaller discussion
yeah
so that's probably one of the big keys
well actually they're pretty good i used to live in wisconsin i only moved to texas about four years ago but
well you know this is my first trial
too
yeah
every time i have a dinner party lately we just barbecue hamburgers so that's good
yeah
yeah
i've
my worst dinner was
a cordon bleu chicken or chicken cordon bleu
i made that one night for guests it just took forever to cook
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that sounds that's good too
what do you marinate them in
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
yeah little cherry tomatoes or something
yeah
um-hum i love mushrooms anyway just to
i love mushrooms just about any way
that's neat
uh-huh
some frozen what
oh okay
uh-huh
well what's your best meal to cook though your best simple one
yeah one that you when you're in a hurry for a decent meal
uh-huh
yeah have you seen that wok on tv
no
the one you put on top the burners beat out with the hammer
uh-huh
uh-huh
you like the electric one then
right
does your wife do her own oriental cooking though
she probably she probably doesn't care for much for the greasy stuff
she doesn't
hum
i've never tried egg rolls
well what goes in them i mean
um-hum
well just about anything can go in the middle
right
well what do you make the dough out of
oh okay
hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
brush it or
brush the egg white on there
huh
right
your kids have you noticed how kids won't eat tomatoes out of anything
cooked tomatoes my little boy would not eat cooked tomatoes
well if i make spaghetti
uh-huh
oh i put them in there i like
well
canned whole tomatoes or canned
yeah
they're peeled
oh you talk rotel tomatoes
rotel tomatoes
rotel ones are sweet
okay
well i just buy those california peeled tomatoes
yeah
yeah if you take that sausage that tube sausage and ground it up
yeah
and put it in with the hamburger it just gives it a better flavor
well in kentucky we call it hamburger you all always call it what
meat
well i've i don't know
tube meat
i know i love deer steaks
venison oh
that sounds good well you must be really into cooking i'm not much into it
um-hum well
in texas usually not in kentucky we didn't do it much but
you all want to cookout everyday here
well it seems like every weekend we're somebody's got a cookout going on here
in texas i've only been here about a year or two
well see that's a lot in kentucky we use them maybe once or twice a month
uh-huh
oh i just like the taste of stuff cooked out on a charcoal grill though
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's good my stepdad my dad my well lord my husband's father is he'll smoke meat oh and he makes a good smoked ham and stuff
of course he has a farm in oklahoma
it's going to be a hard one huh why
uh-huh
you know it's
oh is that right that makes it real tough
huh so how do you how do you make ends meet and how do you make sure that your bills are paid and
yeah
uh-huh
huh
what does he do
a what
uh-huh
oh is that right
well that's tough yeah especially these days when the economy is so bad yeah i work on commission and
and that makes it tough too because i you know you can't you can't always budget what you know you can't have the same budget every month because you know
i am in the roofing business commercial roofing business
and so you know i may do real well this month but next month it may you know may not rain at all and we not have any work so
it makes it really hard to set any budget and you know
so i guess it's
you know each family has their own way of doing it i do it about the same way you do you know we pay what needs to be paid
so that we don't you know we don't have the lights turned off or have the water turned off or the phone turned off
uh-huh
yeah
problems that we have you know are things that we kind of brought on ourselves because we kind of overextended ourselves of couple of you know few years ago with
credit cards and stuff and then the economy went bad and you know i was out of work for a you know for little while
and you know been on commissions for you know few years and it's just
we just never got caught up so do you own your own home
yeah well we do too and that makes it even tougher because you know we tried to put our house up for sale
and the economy's so bad we couldn't sell it
yeah well we did too
yeah well we got we you know all we asked out of our house was the note
and shoot somebody came and offered us we would've lost twenty thousand dollars on our home
you know if we were just to sell it
and so we decided to keep it and kind of just
yeah try to make things work
she doesn't i mean she actually she does she actually probably works more than i do but she does sewing and hair and stuff at home
and so the only you know i guess bright
thing that we have to look forward to is that i own part of the company that i work for and so that's kind of helping us out you know it's making things a little more
little easier because i can always count on a check on friday
um-hum
oh
oh i see
that'd be handy in college
huh well so what word processing program do you use on that machine
ah okay yeah that's the most popular one
yeah i use microsoft word which is the second most popular one
partly because
oh i live and work right near microsoft and it's just real handy to call them up for help or anything kind of a local product
well just for a little bit of typing and stuff i work for i do tech support for a company that makes telephone equipment
and so i use it for
oh memos and for communications i have a modem on my computer
i use it for electronic mail and for sending faxes
hum
uh-huh
oh i see did you get it put back together
hum
hum
did it take glue
did it take glue
oh well that's good
you were probably in a bit of a panic
huh
so what school do you go to in
oh tyler okay
oh really
um-hum
well my roommate's a music major
and i work with seattle opera
when i'm not working as an engineer
oh a bit yeah i actually got into opera through an interest in acting but i'm getting more interested in singing
so yeah i'm in about four operas a year up here and we're i just finished ballad of baby doe
which was written in the early fifties by douglas moore
it's a true story of a couple in colorado in the late eighteen hundreds who became fabulously wealthy from
and
and then before that i was in the nutcracker with pacific northwest ballet i've been doing that for a number of years playing the grandfather in the party scene and then before that i was in phedalio which is the only opera ever written by beethoven
so it's a lot of fun
well i no i didn't but i've started voice lessons recently with a woman who's a principle singer around here for
she's in a usually in a couple of operas a year
so yes so my roommate candice in music department at university of washington and she's
um-hum
well where i'm from the atlantic coast conference is a very big conference and
course we have duke university that was the national champions last year so i'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year they have a lot of the same players back
no this is college basketball right we have like carolina and duke and georgia tech and nc state
teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty
do you like professional basketball
yeah
well that's an up and coming team though
that's somebody you can get behind and be patient
yeah they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons
but i think chicago will probably win the nba again
yeah
that's true
yeah oh my atlanta braves
yeah
it's a little early
we definitely will
good to talk to you bye-bye
well
i think that when you're tried by a jury of your peers they probably the collective
mind of the jury is probably a better vehicle for sentencing than the judge himself because then there's the consensus thing rather than a single person
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well i would i would argue back that
a single person being able to pass a sentence on someone leaves it open to his or her own biases and they may consider
arson to be a heinous crime and child molestation to be less severe so the sentence wouldn't be all that uniformed i mean obviously it would be uniform within the parameters of that judge him or herself
uh-huh
yeah that's a that's one of the biggest problems i think in our society is that the justice system
basically goes by who's got enough money for the best lawyer and the presentation is everything so you know you could have a real dirt ball
be portrayed by his lawyer as a loving family man and color the color the jury's opinions but i don't know
well we could do that or we could explode it to it's logical extreme or it's or
ridiculous extreme and
take the new interactive television
technology that's coming forward and have everybody in the country or everyone who chose to tune in
passing sentence especially in a more involved trial
i don't know i think that the founding fathers had a great idea and the reason that we went away from the single judge or the triad i guess of judges that they have in some systems it just
you know they become instruments of the government and
oh yeah that's why they made election days on tuesday in november you know tuesday was a work day and november was a real pain to travel in november back in what seventeen eighty three
um-hum
um-hum well we're straying from our topic of
well i think it's been interesting to hear you know about the overall outlook you know before we ended the war what implications we'd be dealing with you know the
strong religious beliefs and you know it's just another
attitude you know and what we are really getting into and the fact that war you know coalition forces stuck together and
you know i just think now is that they should have finished saddam off because i think
we're just going to see repercussions down the line because he's he'll probably maintained power it sounds like he's you know knocked down the revolt you know so
or at least got saddam
you know if they you know if they
yeah no i don't think i don't i don't think a lot of them didn't want him to lose you know power completely but it's hard to say
yeah to go to go after the political heads of state but
yeah
yeah but
anyway but now it looks like you know kuwait has asked us to defend its borders more of a permanent type of basis which will be a first
so it's interesting
yeah
yeah
yeah i don't know if the yeah united states is interested as much as establishing a democracy
as opposed to just getting rid of saddam you know it just
but you know we'll see if anything if he
if he gets stability and he doesn't you know get knocked off you know by a coup or something down the line you know what happens you know down the road i just it'll be interesting
yeah
um-hum
yeah well it's interesting
yeah interesting there's like a two square mile area that's occupied by some iraqi soldiers and kuwait's saying it's their land
and they have the their line of demarcation is that what they call it
and they've already outlined that for the cease fire and apparently we don't want to deal with that but the kuwaitis want this want these this land back that they're saying it's theirs
so that was kind of interesting that we said that we said no we're not going to get involved you know we've already established you know the line of cease fire do you know and the demarcation line so
they were definitely trying to avoid any hostilities i thought it was interesting though that we did shoot down some of their airplanes when they went up but i don't think they're doing that anymore
yeah well they warned them we told them we would this is after that the cease fire so
i don't know maybe they were helicopters i thought they were i thought they were letting the helicopters fly around
yeah
anyway so it's
yep
yeah
well they hate i mean they hate us over there most those people
but obviously i think it was
you know the heads of state obviously you know
you know the ones that let us in but
it's that's anyway i would think
yeah i think it was good that
that we got that you know that
you know we drew the line somewhere
and whether that
you know what effect it has in the long run you know to be all right
um-hum and i and i think
yeah i the think you know it'll deter the next person from
you know thinking the same types of things but i think the problem is that we'll never get away from
the expansion idea i mean you know we're territory in general we're going to run into another you know
i don't want to go so far and say it's a hitler but crap saddam seems like he's as bad as hitler almost by the way you know they torture and kill people you know from what you read but
you know once the nuclear power you know nuclear
you know bombs get in the hands of some of these other countries for them to you know who knows
who may try what down the road
yeah that's another thing is that they you know they just they don't understand implications i don't think or may or may not but
yeah well we'll see and you know it has i may fairly young here i got to
you know it's just a matter if he can survive you know without somebody else you know a coup attempt or something
all righty and take her easy all righty bye-bye
recycling yeah
oh you did
uh-huh
you mean like bottles of what kind
oh coke bottle okay yeah
oh that's terrific
yeah so you have to separate the glass from the plastic from the
from the paper oh that's really
yeah
yeah
well i i'm very interested in this because i think it's extremely necessary and i i've tried to you know from the very beginning i started you know trying to recycling even before they had any program
you know they just sort of had voluntary trash you know bins you could put your plastic in and now they it's they're trying to have
a city wide program where they're actually have special trucks to pick up your separated plastic and glass and newspapers
but well they've got trucks for part of the city and they haven't gotten enough trucks you know manufactured yet to take care of the whole city of plano
so some of the people in plano do have that recycling and it's pick up at their door and you know at their driveway and we don't
so we still have to take it voluntarily to the library where they have the you know the glass bin and the and the aluminum and but there they don't take plastic
oh that's great
see we're we don't have that yet either and i'm trying you know i keep trying to remember to bring my little canvas bag into the store with me but i can't remember to do it
it's real hard to break that habit
you know just going into the grocery for five or six thing and then you get in there you think why i don't have the bag with me you know
but we have you know a lot now i saw one lady not to long ago with five or six of those canvas bags and she had them all with her and she took her grocery home in those which i thought was great
you just never see anybody with them
so
oh they did yeah that's not to
oh they do okay
yeah well good for you
yeah they really we need to encourage i mean i know in new jersey where i'm from
but plano just needs to get more of these trucks
yeah
oh yeah
see they have to do it yeah new jersey especially i mean that's a really highly populated state i guess massachusetts is to
is not is that where you're from originally is that where you were born
yeah
yeah so you've been around
well it's i just i just think the more you know you just each person have to consciously think about doing of something little or something big whatever you can do
but
oh yes
oh that's a neat idea i never would have thought of that
well that's the that's the thing that there are thing you can do that you can't you know nobody thinks about
there are these things that people would get their minds working and just you know brainstorming that you just can it's a whole new way of thinking
are they really well that's neat
oh for heaven sakes that's right that's amazing because we use to live in baltimore
we lived there for a while before we came down and we lived in pennsylvania and then we came here about fifteen years ago
she was where she was at what hospital
yes
yes i'm a scoutmaster in boy scouts
i'd say i camp quite a bit
well we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping
and we also carry all our equipment with us
and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again
how about yourself
-ell that's good
um-hum
great
what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and do they cook on stoves
um-hum
uh-huh course i imagine it gets cold in parts of utah
it doesn't get very cold in texas
so lots of times we don't even take tents
we just use trail tarps
it's just a piece of material that has that has a lot of
places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent
like a they're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking
so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then they're not very heavy see so you carry them with you and
they'll keep you dry or whatever
um-hum
yes in fact last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer
in the morning and in the afternoon just deer everywhere
but we got to see a lot of deer
out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night is make sure that all the food's put away and so forth
because we have armadillos do you know what a armadillo is
um-hum
and possums and raccoons
and we have those creatures down here that they like to
they like to go hunting for a midnight snack
and so that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away
they will if you attack them
but most time they run away from you
if they if they see you're up you know
so
are you still there okay it worked that time okay
well we just ate out had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late and we had italian have you ever been to the olive garden
it yeah well
do you really like italian food
then don't
then this'll probably be i mean this isn't really excellent italian food that sounds terrible to tell you go somewhere where it's not that great but it's
you're not going to believe this i have to tell you this if i don't because you're in plano that
which i'm not no it's all the garlic bread and all the salads you can eat with an entree
so it wasn't too bad it really wasn't but i was more in the mood for french toast anyway so
but i really like italian food though but do you have any favorite
yes uh-huh
oh you're kidding
oh sure
yeah and you can usually get a variety of what you're looking for like at gatti's or something like that
six thirty five uh-huh
oh yeah pappasito's we went there on my birthday in march it's great
too much like a bar naturally and mexico yeah i know i've seen it
the food is probably i'm not a i'm not a mexican food gourmet by any means but it's probably the best tasting i don't know if it would you classify that as tex-mex
the shredded beef the type of spices or sauces they use
every
really
uh-huh
i've never had anything there that wasn't delicious
even though you have to stand in line and all that that's the only thing i don't like about it too it's a little bit with the meat market atmosphere you know even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to be not to be around that
i'm trying to think of what else we like to eat the one thing i notice it's just about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt i mean we find it prohibited just the cost anymore
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
yeah and i don't know how you feel about that but i think some of it's over priced
yeah it is i don't know
um-hum uh-huh
oh yeah my husband likes that yeah off of arapaho down there yeah august moon uh-huh
i don't like it at all usually so
yeah i love seafood and i like a lot of different ethnic foods i like japanese food there's a place on greenville called sagar's
well we haven't been in years down near presby and i had a meeting down there today and i saw that and i said gee i remember that they offer you authentic japanese feeding or american or piano bar
which was really over priced
um-hum but great desert bar
yeah
yeah i like barbecue have you ever been to the i think it's called spring creek barbecue yeah they have pretty good food yeah
yes i would be in hog heaven and how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want or do you still order for them or
oh congratulations
uh-huh
it's really sad isn't it because it's hard to get them away from junk then
um-hum
um-hum i know where that yeah
right that's all
um-hum
well that's all right as long as i was going to say because with six people how do you with two we have a problem
i mean i can't even imagine you know trying to you sound like you're doing pretty well there with four children
that's the way to yeah well we're getting ready to i shouldn't say this on this conversation but it's just on my mind we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt
yeah we're excited
i'm thirty something and i and i said is that what makes them drool anyway you know i guess are you is it a little bit constricted because a lot of restaurants don't take in terms of talking about restaurants i mean are a lot of restaurants
how are they when you have children let alone three or four children
uh-huh
sure
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
the yuppie kind of crowd yeah i just i just i've been in some places where they say they take children and then i've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude you know and that always just bothered me
it was absolutely putrid for italian food i can't remember the name of it it's on
i can't yeah no that's mexican it's right across from on the dillard's side there or folley's
i can't it's in the strip yeah and it had white i think it was like paper where you could write on them or something with crayons and it was just terrible
yeah where you felt like you were
right like you're in a bad part of italy or something
boy but other than that i don't know we do our share of pizza eating too
me too
no except it just makes me fat no i'm just kidding but you can
maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere okay uh-huh bye-bye
yes
well
we've done a lot of tent camping that's probably the closest definition that i usually think of but there are a couple of places in the san francisco area that are considered environmental campsites that are
sort of like rustic cabins they have no electricity and no water
but there's usually a pot belly stove or something like that and
you can spread out sleeping bags on wooden surfaces so
we really enjoy that
oh that's beautiful
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
i don't think i've ever seen a john tent that's
that's more rustic camping perhaps than i've done usually where someplace where we're sort of close to
uh-huh
oh wow
how do you like that i don't think i've ever been camping quite that long that seems like
without showers and all you how did you
how did you enjoy that
sounds like fun thing about shasta too is there's so many other things that you can do
uh-huh is patterson fairly close to shasta
oh okay
oh well
yeah
uh-huh
there are a lot of camping grounds county and state facilities in the santa cruz mountains south of here so
tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes
yeah they really enjoy it i think that she's at an age now you're not as concerned about where she's going to run off to she can pretty much stay close and
i think her first camping trip she was eight months old so
hopefully she'll learn to enjoy it as much as we do
uh-huh
um-hum that's kind of fun we did that once in yosemite too
right that was one good reason in yosemite the person in the camper next to us had gotten hit by the bears that night so we were glad we were a little more secure
yes in fact i've never been camping at all in yosemite outside of the camper arrangement i know that they have tent cabins
that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but
yeah it's a beautiful place i think i worry that it's changing so much so quickly the valley has become so popular
do you remember it a long time ago i don't know if you ever went there like back in the fifties or
oh uh-huh
my folks used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little and that at that time there really weren't designated campsites so
people would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their terrain and
it's a little bit better arrangement today
um-hum
it's scaled back considerably right now my exercise is pretty much limited to softball league and occasional ride on the bike
but i
i was just recently well recently nine months ago got married and bought a house so my outside activities have been curtailed somewhat
yeah that that's true that's true it's there's always something to do and
and it keeps me going
but
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
right
uh-huh
oh gosh
wow
uh-huh
no that that's yeah that's a that's a tough situation
uh-huh
yeah
oh that it's so aggravating to have an injury like that my wife
yeah and she started running down there and all the hills
and she lasted about two weeks and her ankles couldn't take it anymore
she was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot and
ever since that it's just been real difficult it's real aggravating because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff
even if she does get on flat ground so she's kind of in the same mode she was all ready to
get back into it and start running five k's and ten k's and stuff this spring and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape
and when you want to do it it's really aggravating you know it it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise and it's another thing to already
be past that and then not be able to because of your health
yeah
well it's
uh-huh
sure
yeah uh-huh it is and you know you
it's really it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff it your body just gets used to it and yeah i don't particularly enjoy
well i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that i do enjoy riding bike but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that
i can't say i really enjoyed it all that much but once i got used to it
it was habit forming it was i felt so bad if i didn't
physically i mean i just my body was tuned into that mode
yeah
yeah that's for sure
okay
that's right
did you really
okay yeah
right
okay
yeah it is we're on we're on a little street called bison trail
it's only about a block and a half long but it's over on the other end it it's over by the far edge of stephen's park golf course
yeah it's you know where the little bridge is on north oak cliff boulevard yeah we are just south of that little bridge back up on the hill in the trees there
four houses sold last summer and three sold the summer before and everybody in their
late twenties to mid thirties are buying and starting to rebuild and fix things up again and everybody is real excited
yeah and then
oh it's a lot of fun the people are great there too our
we've got a real active neighborhood association and we have well we've got four regular parties every year and we do a neighborhood recycling program and
you know all that kind of stuff so it's a lot of fun and it is it's a really beautiful area
and some of the people
some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses and they're getting they're getting them at a real bargain
you know they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars
and they're just going to town with them they're people are putting in pools and
and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original you know nineteen thirty nineteen forties look
and it it's really coming around i guess
it's worth the trip
uh-huh
okay
yeah
okay
oh wow
yeah
uh-huh that's right
yeah ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big oh i guess it's twenty eight by fifteen front porch and next door we've got an austin stone
across the street the guy just it was burnt out about two years ago and the guy moved in and completely redid it and it's got oh it's got a rounded
front on it it's all brick and he's landscaped his yard and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that so
yeah there there's a variety you just don't see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot
oh she could a little bit we i tell you what we got into the fitness center at methodist
and they have a quarter mile track there
so she has started doing that rather than rather than take off
you know you don't want to she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in dallas regardless whether it's north dallas or whatnot and
when she goes over to this fitness center it's fenced in and there's somebody in the building watching her and all that so it's there's a lot of consideration
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right
that's right
that's right
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
that's right that's right it only takes one time that is it's a hard lesson to learn so
uh-huh
yeah
yeah it's you know it goes all over well it's you know we got this
i haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down
uh-huh
yeah
yeah c n coverage was really good
yeah
yeah
it kind of get wrapped up in it
yeah
kind of like watching the olympics
kind of like watching the olympics
yeah
right
do you normally read the newspaper every day
the what the post
uh-huh
yeah
i don't i don't regularly watch
news or
newspaper i would say i get probably most of it from my friends you know they finally told me hey there's a war going on oh okay
just the raleigh local paper
oh it's not even a comparison
yeah
yeah the news is the same way the local news here is kind of lousy
it's not much different than when i lived in roanoke virginia which is really small town
yeah
yeah
that explains it
right
right
uh-huh
yeah
i'm in graduate school so i have a really weird schedule and i don't and i don't really don't have time for t v and newspaper just i wouldn't i wouldn't have time to read it so i'm
finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most time effective
yeah
what's neat is seeing history happen you know
i guess that's it
yeah
saw it first hand
little too much maybe
no not really
i'm in computer science
i'm twenty five
yeah
uh-huh
it's almost getting to the point where there is there's too much that
yeah you shouldn't even worry about most of the stuff i mean i don't know it's a little near sighted but
yeah
yeah
okay did it work out your first time all right
okay alright bye-bye
where you on the phone a long time
yeah
to he called in to get somebody on the line it took him about half an hour to find somebody
okay
uh-huh
yeah
so for the last year i mean we just got married and we decided well for the first year we won't get a tv so i mean i'm totally out of it as far as tv goes
really
yeah
vcr everything else
really
yeah
yeah
i don't think so
well see another thing was i worked on second shift for like a year and a half so
i would never see any shows anyway and then before that i was in college for four years and i never watched tv then because i didn't have time so
i mean when i did watch tv it was soaps and mtv because the girls i lived with never changed the channel i mean it was like
yeah
me too when
i know i mean i'm i almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took about it at dinner and everything else it you know it's like
well about almost a year yeah
well i mean i never really watched it much growing up but i thought you know my husband would really like miss it because he was an only child and he he's seen a lot of tv and i figured oh no it will never last but
i mean i don't miss it that much
that's funny
i've seen cheers probably five times and i've seen cros cosby show probably ten times
oh you have yeah i've heard it's pretty cool
yeah
yeah
i watched a lot of tv when the war was on
and then i like watching a lot of like college basketball and pro football i mean that sounds kind of stupid but i do like
yeah
sherman texas where you from
so are you really from texas though you
well sounds like you're from up north yeah
oh i was gonna say cause i wondered if you really you know if you had any teams you like watching from up north or something
yeah
yeah
well i'm from indiana
yeah so i like the bears
i watch huh
yeah
yeah
i used to watch oprah a lot in the afternoon before i'd go to work and stuff and now i see her every once in awhile like if i go workout at ti you know they have those t tv's right in front of the treadmills
i don't know she's not as good as she use to be but
sure disposition's gone downhill
was what
oh yeah it was pretty cool i mean back then and then the show did you see the show where she lost all that fat and she wheeled it out in the cart
that was so cool and then man she's really porked out again i guess but yeah
i'd eat too
really
yeah we got we got the dollar cinema in sherman so we usually see like first rate movies right away
yeah i'm sorry
well it's hard to talk about something it's like me talking about taxes or something i feel bad cause i mean i should know something about tv shows but
what was that
uh-huh
i might of i forget was he the guy that got captured
oh
yeah but what about this wolf guy
oh you know what my absolute favorite show is david letterman i love that guy
and saturday night live i used to watch that like i'd come home from second shift and watch him like for an hour and a half he's great
huh-uh
has it gotten better
really
uh-huh
yeah
that's funny
like wayne's world i love that
well i don't know i've seen it off and on i think
huh
yeah that's where i've seen it because i've seen it off and on probably
yeah we bug our we you know one friend of ours got rid of his because we motivated him because we you know because we were getting along without ours so he sold his but the rest of our friends we go and watch them
uh-huh
