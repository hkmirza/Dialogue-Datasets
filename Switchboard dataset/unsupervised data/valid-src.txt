favorite type of music or musician or any
do you
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i i'm very i'm very varied as well i
ever met a type of music i don't like except for maybe you know heavy metal and that
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
huh
oh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
oh gosh
uh-huh yeah sure
my two listening enjoyments are but you know jazz can get on my nerves after a while you can't just listen to it you know to
especially a lot of the deeper stuff you just can't listen to it for enjoyment unless you're
blues are okay i tell you i do like i grew up on blue grass music my dad is a big blue grass fan and so
no it doesn't it doesn't
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah i yeah i grew up on him
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
oh do you
yeah you sure do
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
oh they're great aren't they
yeah
yeah it sure is yeah
uh-huh
yeah i like his he has a nice smooth voice
yeah sure
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah something like that it was last year wasn't it
do you have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting
um-hum
yeah
oh well we don't have a real strict budget
we have a low budget to work on but we you know for like groceries we saved up this much per week and then we just spend about so much we don't
i don't know of a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there
a certain amount
yeah
oh
wow that's great
oh
hm
yeah well that's a good idea
let's see the other thing there the topic was talking about was
if you if i don't all i can think of is if you don't keep a real tight budget how do you control expenses but
huh oh yeah
and you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare
and so
entertainment things like that then
somewhere in out in the wash it'll come out that we have enough to get back there you know
uh-huh that's right
uh-huh
uh-huh that's right
uh-huh
but yeah
uh-huh
yeah so what are your favorite tv shows
oh i haven't watched that very much is that do you like that
when was that on
on abc
oh yeah well
it may be that it was recently replaced
by actually by what may be my favorite tv show of because sort of twin peaks
yeah so twin peaks what happened was
i think twin peaks went off
they moved to a saturday night for a while and then put and then put something i guess gabriel's fire on it and at thursday nights and then they moved
no gabriel's fire was on cbs i think i take that back
i'm not sure but anyway they moved it back and forth and that's when peaks was back in that time slot as well
so i don't know
no i have no idea
i don't think
i don't think that was on abc anyway i don't know what happened to it though
i'm sort of a very big twin peaks fan and beyond that i just sort of watch anything that happens to be on i'm
half the time i'm a tv addict and the other half the time i just ignore it
it's really bad yeah there's some new shows that i sort of like
have you seen this shannon steel show or
it's about a lawyer it's one of these lawyer shows you know they seem to be popular these days
and then there's just a lot of those sort of blair shows floating around
yes
i've noticed that every major station now has their own law show there's la law and there's equal justice
some other one law and order or something
lots of lots of these things that are floating around now they seem to be popular shows do you like the law shows or
that makes logical sense also saves a lot of time with commercials
oh i have i've i watched that late i guess it's on late saturday nights or something that's on during the day as well
have you have you seen this often
oh really
yeah
really
i don't know that
i
that don't it seems like i mean if wrestling is prime time
professional wrestling it seems like it's just
just like pros in a wrestling to me i don't i don't see any difference though
i don't understand it they consider it violent i have so ever i have seen it on
where we are i live in rochester new york
and i think a
yes
where are you
you're everybody i speak to is in texas oh
oh yeah but i'm in new york
and we seem we seem to have i think the american gladiators is on
sunday afternoons actually around here
as well sometimes
i think it's been on i think i've seen it during the day
i know i've seen it during the day in florida
when i was at my parents down there
definitely seen it on during the day down there and i don't think it's a very violent show i think it's funny
i think it's a real good concept i think it's something completely new
well
yeah i think so i think because people sort of get through you know
i think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical
fitness as well as the
as well as you know some mental fitness and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth
well don't they take people who have some sort of
big abilities like and at least they used to when it when it the first ones i saw they had a man on who was he played college football and almost went pro and they had a
a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the she was in the junior olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very big sports backgrounds to have they leaned away from that sort of
oh that's how they do it
really
yeah okay i just thought they had some
yeah i thought they had some sort of i mean i thought they were just poor people like us i guess not that's great
but maybe i'll try it one day
i will get on it one day and see if i can
what do they win they win money i think don't they
really
wow all that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour
one little ball here and there yeah and this guy's beating you up
so i don't mind the beating up part i actually feel the tennis balls would hurt
they look like
yeah they seem like a tennis ball but there also doesn't look like
it's almost livable
yeah but best it i don't think i could i could handle those tennis balls
so what else to you tape besides american at there anything else
huh
okay
oh okay
uh-huh
but i'm sure that's fun
uh-huh
oh okay well they seem to be on later all always right before the news is when i catch them
i tend to if nothing else i tend to turn on the television at eleven o'clock just to watch the news
and or nightline or something
just sort of get a good you know
a good a good think for the day
yes
when is yours on
oh gosh well i'm sorry i interrupted
yeah ours is on actually it ours is on at eleven it it's eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty five now here in new york i think they do that i think they put things on at
eleven o'clock here and i think they put it like eleven o'clock
california time like in california but in the middle they sort of like central time or mountain time they push things back
so i was actually i'm not sure i was in i was in iowa awhile ago and noticed that everything was an hour earlier
so does your prime time start at seven o'clock
wait no not even the news but do they have like
do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth start at seven o'clock
you so like you know the regular television shows that are that are very popular do they start at seven or at eight
right because that would actually start at eight o'clock here
yeah that would all start at
that would all start at
eight o'clock here that wouldn't start at seven
we have at seven o'clock we just have
the they'll play you know they have old reruns of cheers or something
from seven to seven thirty and then something else from seven thirty to eight but then at
at eight o'clock is when everything starts
which is
which is strange i mean because yours start at seven and end at ten and ours start at
oh that's great
oh all the time
do you watch cheers or
there's it's at that was actually a big dilemma for me now because cheers
cheers and twin peaks are now on the same time
okay
is yours
is it is it brick or
okay
yeah our neighborhood everything is a little bit different
i mean you they're all custom built homes and used in just about every other one is a different builder so every one has its own unique design and characteristics
um-hum
um-hum
that's good
northwest hills
no i'm not really familiar with the area i'm i come to austin very seldom
that's about it
so and i couldn't even tell you where she lives i know she lives off congress somewhere
but
between twenty four and thirty one
and
most of them are probably ninety percent brick
and whatever little bit of wood trim and everything else
so even up to on the second story the brick goes all the way up there's not much siding
yeah
yeah we have a two story and it's
i can't we don't have i don't think we have more than maybe just on one side there's just a little bit of siding but i mean it's very little
stained glass
or frosted yeah uh-huh
yeah in fact ours we have stained glass in ours
and quite a few of them on our street have what they call a frosted glass which is kind of like a bevelled etched glass
yeah so yeah it's kind of a mixture and then we have some that are just solid wood with just a just a regular normal small window in the middle of it
so there's a variety there
it it's very nice we we're real proud we of course we've waited a lot of years for it
we have made several moves and been able to appreciate the equity
to have to step down a little bit and then kind of build your way back up
no i don't
oh
well of course that's the best way to do it
don't burn any bridges
well i you know i hope that you can get back into something that you want
i'm an engineer
with a defense industry
and
you know we've of course we have a daughter that's six and we and we would like to stay in this house until she gets out of high school at least
oh yeah and you can also a lot of times you know like in even and not in and necessarily in this neighborhood but in neighborhoods close by here there's a lot of people who have left that or had to leave it
and they became hudd foreclosures
and people are picking those up for very little so maybe you could luck into something like that and get a real nice house that way
no i don't want one i've had one before
and it's just a lot of upkeep
and you spend a lot of time with them and then and there is there is quite a bit of cost involved
chemicals water it and if you have it i had mine heated so the electricity well not the electricity but the gas and electricity because you do have both
was pretty high and i just i just don't want to go through that anymore
no you're right
i can imagine
um-hum
oh i know
well i mean it especially in this neighborhood you know of course you can tell there there's about three different major jumps
they start here they start at about one fifty and go up to about five hundred
and you can you can and you may have one next to you that's four hundred and the other one you know down the other street will be you know one fifty
well actually they're pretty much just spaced here and there which makes it nice because you get to you get to share some of the appreciation of everybody else's property value
and like the guy just next door to us he's probably got the same square footage but he paid he paid about a hundred thousand more than we did
but you ought to see his pool he paid forty five thousand dollars just for his pool
and it's got little fountains and all kinds of stuff
and of course i spent all my i spent most of the extra money that we had i spent it in you know we put curtains and all this stuff in and then we put the landscaping did the landscaping so that there's minimal you know upkeep in the yard
because i travel a lot and i and i don't have time
and i you know have some deck in the back
and you know we have like a it's not like a it's not really a gazebo but it's kind of like a little area out there where the where we have some you know table and chairs and stuff like that
and there's just very little to mow very little upkeep you have to pull weeds out of the flower beds occasionally but what i sorry
no i was going to say when i designed this house i designed it myself
and i took a lot of time to plan out everything i like you know where my stereo where the tv so i have built in cabinets and you know big covered patio big game room big living area big dining room
is probably the size of a small bedroom
and lots and lots of shelves built in chest of drawers and stuff in the closets so it it's really it we designed it to stay here for a while
uh-huh
he does i from just his speaking i hear a strong tinge of integrity
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
but are we what do you think are we talking about
the
the mechanical element you might say or are we talking about the human element i think it's the human element
exactly yes
oh sure
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i think dave i think one of the
another thing is that we have such a great disparity between the consumer and the businesses and that all reflects into the budget also
we
we the american people don't have faith in the government and they don't have faith in business
exactly
well then you have you have president bush going over to japan to try to do some wrangling over there to for the trade deficit and they send the send the top executive from gm
and they're making
four and five times they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
gm is trying to market their products and is
that's another way is that the consumers just don't trust big business they just don't there's
so right there you have an element of the political government you have an element of big business and you have the consumer watching and they're just going what's this
uh-huh
you know i agree with you to a certain extent but the problem is with you know our capitalistic government
the almighty dollar doesn't have any ethical code with it
and i it's just like how you know what would you do the exxon valdez
you see what are we just say are we taking government out of it we need those controls because
the in the our capitalistic society it's just those controls it's just it's
the business it starts going and if they can its the dollar that dictates and if they can find someplace to dump something or their pollution and we're polluting something
did you watch the bulls this morning
looked they looked like they were closing it out and then detroit kept coming back and isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end and i think the bulls won by two
yeah they looked real good and
right
yeah well they they're balancing their attack and i think they look like
they'll repeat although here in the bay area people are real impressed with what don nelson's done with the warriors
i saw the second half of the game last night and they were impressive
billy owens looks like he was that was a good move for the warriors to trade for him
well they traded away
mitch richmond or is it tim hardaway one of the two
who along with chris mullin was you know though three were three of the best in the nba and they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either richmond or hardaway to sacramento for billy owens and
yeah oh yeah he's really worked out well they've got the warriors have got a team and
i think that'll be real interesting to see what they can do they're ahead and the lakers are down i guess in fourth position in the west and i don't know in the east i don't know is it boston in first place
boy they've had a hard time they said they've lost a lot of squeakers
yeah
how do people in texas deal with dallas houston and san antonio do you for example like san antonio in dallas
so there isn't much crossover huh
yeah
yeah it's true because san antonio isn't that close to you are they
no
is it
yeah so it's not something you'd drive
yeah i was thinking maybe david robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing
yeah i mean that's i think the way it i think that's the way it works now in basketball you know magic was a franchise for the lakers and you know bird for the for the celtics and
well it it's steve
well yeah i
let's see how about
let's see about ten years ago
what do you think was different ten years ago from now
um-hum
uh-huh
what do you well
actually ten years from today seems rather short
but i do agree that generally it's
society has sort of
let's see rushed everything ahead
and
i don't know it leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently
but i think that has a lot to do with economic situations
hm it depends
it's hard to say because i think
people were busy ten twenty years ago too
i just
i'm twenty eight
yeah
yeah
i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along it's just a matter where priorities are at placed
and that usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
and now it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work
i think that's part of it too but i do think
no i don't
no i don't think that but then there are a lot of people that don't have that
that
that really do need to work
i think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents
it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
i'm saying that the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working
is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living
because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who
the decreasing
middle class in this country
i think that that's in my opinion the case
so
i mean i have met people that
that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that really need the job
so
um-hum
uh-huh
right
a family reunion this past year first time in many years and
and i had three of my sisters there with their family and we all got together in gatlinburg tennessee and
spent the week there up in the mountains and rented a little house and
sort of visited and got to know each other we hadn't been around each other for quite a while over the years so it really was sort of nice
well it worked out fairly well you know as a kid i don't know about yourself but we used to have big reunions and it was so nice and
you know it's just something that you don't do anymore and we had such a good time that
that we're already deciding to have one in two years say in disney world or somewhere in florida just get together and
just something you need to make time for
so we don't get to see each other very often
sure
well that's great
uh-huh
well that's neat
which you in a great area for it
i admire people do that but we're just not that well organized and you know everyone's heading different directions so it's very hard to get together
sure that's the important thing just the important thing is to do it
and that's great
oh you bet
it's like it's like high school high school and college reunions i didn't go i'm i just turned fifty years old recently and
didn't go to many reunions until i hit my twentieth i believe and of course i haven't missed one since then because it's just so enjoyable
you get to see all your old friends and what's going on and it's just a it's a neat deal i look i look forward to them
oh yes
yeah kids getting older getting married and graduating high school and college and whatever
just lots of things to catch up on and we spent that time to do that
no this was this was just for the big guys just for the parents
it was sort of neat though in fact we had a little rule that we would we would not take the kids with us this time but all of our kids are a little older so
yes all of our kids are in a middle and high school and college so and married so
so we just all got together and it was sort of neat
you bet because my mother and dad both were there so it really paid off
yeah it was neat and her four kids were there and their spouses so it worked out real well
are they
what do you think about the peace corps or public service commitment
well i think it was thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft and people said well they young people who were drafted have to
provide military service to the country but there are an awful lot of young people who would
benefit from some sort of public service like the conservation corps back in the thirties or
various other things of that sort and it seems to me that it's not a totally bad idea but i don't quite see how they'd make it work
how would they decide who goes into building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who goes to saudi arabia
yeah the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft
and some people would get military service and some people would get civilian service like working in hospitals this i assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do
when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the army they were allowed to do hospital service or things like that and if they or farm work in world war one i remember
reading about and i suppose that there is justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable
yeah
well i think that in the in the cases that like that they had to be
pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war it was
something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life
oh yeah
sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something
for their room and board and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend even if it's like the peace corps where they don't get most of it until they come home you have to pay them something
oh yeah
yeah now i had a lot of friends who went to the peace corps back in the mid sixties
and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization but on the other hand i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was i don't know what we got for all the money
we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to what was then east pakistan is now bangladesh and to algeria and to
southeast asia and lots of out of the way places but i don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
and it was definitely voluntary too they were not drafting you and sending you against your will
yeah well what about a voluntary program do you think that would be a good idea
i don't either
yeah out here in california there's a program like that for juvenile delinquents the ones that are not dangerous and they don't have to be locked up go to these camps
and they do forestry work they maintain trails and they put up signs and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort
and that i know is run by the state but there may be other things i'm not so sure what kind of training that is for the future for those kids
it's probably a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble but whether it's something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject
oh
yeah i'm sorry i'm going to have to go but my other line is blinking but it was good to talk to you
bye
okay did it click okay well how do you feel about food and cooking
um-hum
well we're vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for i just became a vegetarian over the past year and a half
and it's a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat and
it's a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie where your menu is composed of
things that you want to eat that aren't you know that aren't don't contain meat products or don't contain animal products but maybe aren't you know balanced meal so to speak
so but we feel a lot better since we've become vegetarians
i did at first but not really no not i can't imagine eating meat
the reason i tranged changed to become a vegetarian was for ethical reasons so the idea of me eating meet would be like eating something you know i think of it as something alive
you know so it i can't do it you know for me it's it just
but i do sometimes when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly say steak or something you know that i do admit that i
you know wish you know that i could have that flavor but i know what it i know what it is so i you know i don't want it but
yeah you you'd be surprised the things i mean you could like tonight we're having nature burgers which are like a grain burger
and you can it's really pretty good i the people i serve it to like my sister and family members
well my family members are vegetarians now basically i mean they're not they're not when they go out to eat they sometimes eat other you know meats and things but at home we eat vegetarian meals
and you can you know make pasta meals and
different things that people are use to eating that wouldn't offend you know that they wouldn't be offended that there wasn't a meat there
you know at the at the table or even pizzas you can make a pizza that's not that doesn't have any animal you know
you would have animal products it would have cheese but you know not meat
yeah we do eat i had become for about three or four months i was a vegan which is a person that eats no animal products no cheeses no eggs
and that's even more difficult it's really hard to find the products and it's hard that's even harder to keep yourself from eating
because it adds so much to meals you know when you put cheese on something or
you know it really makes a difference
eggs yeah eggs my mother just said eggs it's hard to find substitutes for eggs when you're baking and cooking and things
so although you can i mean there's cookbooks and there's ways to do it it's a lot more expensive too i think you know the market is just not made for a vegan so but
yeah it if well it really is because just today we were in the grocery store and they had lentils and i
and where we're living now is a small town that really doesn't you know just having that kind health food store that caters to those kind of needs and you just have to hope that the grocery store will you know the bigger grocery stores
and they actually had lentils which some stores don't have things like that you know which
yeah see that lot of people don't and that's
yeah like lentil soup or something people don't and that's such a good source of protein or like soybeans you know people think ugh they think it's something really
horrible but there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you don't even know where in there so
it's just a matter of learning you know
yeah so but it
um-hum
yeah well think of it think of it like this takes a long time for meat to digest
and you know if you've got that sitting in your stomach i mean even when you sleep it's still sitting there digesting so you kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so hard to digest all that meat
you know because it takes longer than some products some other foods in your stomach to digest that meat
so
you prepare a lot of vegetables and there's lots of different casseroles and things so you just make you
no yeah you just you just well see at ours we're living with my family my folks now so
you know they have the turkey you know they do they you can't stop you know everyone's life but
i think if in our own house we didn't we would have things like a casserole things like that centered more on
the vegetables as far as
we might have one special dish one special casserole that was our one special thing like the turkey you know with the main meal kind of thing
and i suppose because it's for me ethical we'd just play up the fact that
thanksgiving's you know is a time for everyone to give thanks even turkey you know yeah
so
but it it's interesting finding different recipes although my mother is the one that cooks
which
yeah lots of them lots of them and i have this one in front of me right now as a matter of fact it's called sundays at the moosewood restaurant and
it's out of new york it's a pretty famous restaurant out of new york and almost every single recipe in there is vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but a few of those but not anything
so there's quite a few out there
um-hum
this is a healthier way to go you know and this is what your body wants this is what your body really needs and when you think about what is what's the real reason your eating i know i know it's for taste because i'm boy am i a taste person but
but the main reason is for fuel you know and when you read so much information that tells you that meats
and different animal products you know are causing can cause different kinds of diseases
and the people i really think in general people in the united states just don't eat enough vegetables you know because
you can talk grain all you want as far as you know cleaning your system out so to speak but you can't beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and the kind that you can't get from a little pill
because your body doesn't synthesis in the same way that it does when it gets it in raw food you know
yeah that's true that's true so you it's all important you know it's an all important thing that you
yeah i would say you know almost everyone and except me except myself and you know my husband but
and yeah i
i don't know that my mother and father have seen any improvements since we've been here as far as them switching to meat but do you think you fill healthier mom
my mother says she feels
well i originally came from saint louis so the saint louis cardinals are one
i moved to kansas city see i have i have a tendency to adopt teams when i went go to a go to a town yeah so i lived in kansas city for a couple years and i adopted the royals i lived in houston for two and a half years so i adopted the
the houston astros so i mean you know i've got quite a few
no i don't i don't get into that too much every once in a while i will keep in touch with maybe like who's in the top five of hitting or something like that but i don't get into you know how many errors somebody has or things like that
um-hum
um-hum
i've heard of that one
well i didn't know that that's supposed to be a real good statistic
well that's true they don't have the offense to get out or to have the more runs so
um-hum
hum
which i was kind of leaning toward anyway to tell you the truth
i kind of think it was necessary i mean i don't i'm not a big
pure power hitter anyway i mean i don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time i mean i think that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it
but when you get two strikes on you have a you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit you know if it's a perfect shot go for it but i mean you know the strike outs were a big problem for him and plus supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway so
um-hum
yeah well that's true
um-hum
right
yeah well there's another point to that too they said that he was horrible at batting with men on base now
having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you know gives you one run obviously but i mean if you can't do it with men on base there's something definitely wrong you know you you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to be able to
score enough runs to be able win in these in this day and age so
i think the royals will
do okay they have they have several pitchers that had badly years last year and they are they're these
cycle pitchers they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good saberhagen has won supposedly the cy i think he won cy year two out of three years and you know so he's very much due for a good year
well now see that's a good question i that's i don't know how oakland's going to react to being swept in the world series last year they could very easily
take that as a challenge which is the way most teams you know naturally do and just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them so
um-hum
oh yeah baseball is there is there life up there like football is down here i think
i lived in the suburbs of saint louis yeah
um-hum
hum
yeah oh yeah i definitely do in fact i've got family that still lives up there from what i hear from everybody up there they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go but i've been following spring training and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far so
that well it can be it really kind of depends on
what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if in spring crain training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do
then it really doesn't give you any indication but if they were playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just
you know come out and just won all kinds of games in spring craning training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so
exactly yeah
you can't
right i think the best thing that you can do is go with the players that are
that have the talent to do the best years and that they hadn't had these
gigantic career years yet and just kind of assume that you know one of them is going to break through eventually so and i think they said the reds this last year i'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years
you know and so they may be even better this year
that's a good question i the rangers have a have a pitching problem
and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question they're doing the right thing though they are going with their farm system they're letting their farm system build up and stuff like that and
um-hum
no
um-hum
that's probably true well considering what i've seen in the last you know two seasons i'm beginning to agree with that yeah but i mean you don't have to spend the big money as far as i'm concerned to
to win you just have to spend it if it's necessary in other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team then keep him there don't let him go away you know and i think that's really what's been hurting the rangers
oh yeah they spent more money last year than any other team in the in the league and they were you know toward the bottom of the league so it's like i said spending money doesn't guarantee you winning a pennant
it really doesn't so
you got me i you know i think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go and once you do that you lose everything i mean
um-hum
um-hum
right
that that's the whole point there're so many games in a year that they've got to have repeat customers they can't afford not to and
you know that's one of the things that i think saint louis has done i mean their you know their ticket prices are you know i guess as high as anybody else's but what somehow or another they attract
so many people from some i mean they're a it's a small market and yet they attract as many if not more than most other cities so
it seems to me that the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the same things that are to their determent
they aren't as responsive both to like bad economic times you don't have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing
but when you see a job when you see a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to get it done you know what i mean
oh wow
right
there is that i mean well and then i guess again i like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i don't show up for work there's probably somebody else that could fill my spot but
i imagine and that's nice but it's also nice to be able to
know that you are the person that makes things get done you know if you're not there it doesn't happen
yeah
oh wow oh wow
um-hum
i had some friends of mine get sent up to stanford for a year for college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in california for the summer is not such a bad thing
you know but
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah but i would think that a smaller company you would have a i mean if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that it is uniquely qualified to
take care of it has a chance to grow really fast
and if you can get on top of it before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people
of course i guess if there's only the two of you you'll i mean i guess you're one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so
so the only other thing i can think of is stuff for
things like if there's some kind of child care if someone were married and had kids
if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country
oh you had family in san antonio
oh
okay
and we moved like oh man we used to move like every three years at least
and like i don't know
i mean there's well there's i i've kept in touch with some people from college but i don't i mean i don't really know
yeah i think that we probably will have to have to have a state income tax because texans don't approve of such things as lotteries
well i come here from new york and new york had a state lottery and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state
although we in new york we had to pay a state and a city tax and it was really a great relief when i got to texas that i didn't have to pay that city income tax though
right
it sure does make a difference
uh-huh do you live in dallas
oh you do oh
oh i do too
okay
and then you know too that taxes are less like if you live in mesquite
you know some people will go shopping in mesquite at the malls out there
uh-huh
eight point five
um-hum
is it the is it less in collin county than it is in dallas county
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah it sure did and then once you could deduct at least some of that off your income tax and you can't do that anymore
it really hit me yesterday i had air conditioning service for my car done and i had a little coupon special that was twenty two dollars for air conditioning service where they
checked it and recharged it and put one pound of freon in and if you needed another pound of freon they it was like seven dollars and something
and then with the with the twenty two dollars and the seven something it all came out to i ended up paying like thirty four dollars and i couldn't believe it and the tax you know really hits you
um-hum and then
oh it's been i've been here for nine years
really where'd you come from
oh uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
well i did visit michigan i visited kalamazoo once my sister used to live there
uh-huh
well i'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock the department stores on christmas eve but there were stores that you could go to you know like discount stores and
and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to and you could shop till like twelve or one o'clock that night and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late but it was christmas eve and when i came to dallas
yeah now but they but back then they didn't when i first came no
anyway
yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah and talk a talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that and the taxes on a package of cigarettes i used to smoke you know and
that would have been enough to make me give them up the price of them now but i gave them up a couple years ago because i had some sinus problems
well
well they're like two
or i believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now
maybe a little bit a little bit a little bit more in some places
well i believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton i think it's maybe thirteen or something
because i remember we went to oklahoma to this bingo place this choctaw bingo a couple weeks ago and somebody that went with me bought a carton
for ten dollars and something and they really thought they were getting a big discount
well because it's you know the indians i don't think they pay tax
in oklahoma
and it was a indian
it seems to me that most people rather make a decision between going all out
particularly males go all out on the career or they go or they spend some real quality time with their kids when their when their kids are still young and are willing to spend time with the parents what do you think about that
do you think it's possible
um-hum
i got my office mate he got divorced and
he was talking about that the thing that he was gladdest about in the relationship that he was in before that he spent like
a lot more time than the average father with his kid i mean he took his kids out ice skating and water skiing and i mean just if there was something that he could think of to do with them he went out and did it
and now that he's no longer the wife has custody of the kids he still has a good relationship with the kids
which you know a lot of people even in marriages that stay together try to all of the sudden get to know their kids when they turn eighteen or something like that
but i think i think he did the right thing is making sure that the kids really
i mean they might get mad as heck at the parents but making sure that the kids know from you know one two three that there's no one that loves them as much as dad and mom
you know
yeah
i think it has been changing over the generations you know i see my granddad
now and it's really it's really way too late i mean my granddad grew up in the military you know he was always the never show your feelings but it seems like he tries real hard now to try let his sons know that he loves them and it's
i mean to some extent it's too late
my dad i'm sorry go ahead
yeah my dad
i always knew that my dad loved me he but he never really said it until
oh i don't know i think i was in college the first time i actually heard him say it
but i always knew it i mean he always he always did things so that i knew it
but i think i mean granted it's easy to say i don't have kids but i think that's one of the things i really want to make sure that i do a lot is say it
as many times as just so that they get oh you know come on dad stop that but you know i mean you know i don't know
uh-huh
what kind of stuff do you do with them
well i'm kind of ambivalent also like you say it does affect your privacy i guess i
how i could cope with it i do think in some cases it does make sense and how i could cope with it was if when you accepted a job they told you up front this is part of it
there are certain jobs in which i'd be more likely to feel comfortable about it and those are the jobs in which a person's performance could affect your life
certainly someone who carries a gun
there's been a lot of publicity in new york on long island where
there's been school bus drivers
who have driven erratically and caused accidents and killed kids because they were
on drugs and things
and where your actions could affect somebody's life i'd be much more accepting of drug testing but under no circumstances would i think that you could just go take a job and they could say hey guess what you know we're gonna do this
i think it has to be up front and then you've got the choice of not doing it
well yeah i imagine it would be just this is new company policy and we're doing it to everybody
in which case hey you know you don't like it you can go look for another job but of course that's not so easy you know
right
well you know i'm home a little too often i think they're not calling substitutes that often but at any rate i had taken a state test to be of all things a court officer
my mom had worked for the state and she thought this was a brilliant idea so i just went along with it i thought it'd be neat you know like a james bond woman with a gun and all this and part of the you know you take this test i did very well and they called me in for a physical
and part of it was a test for drugs nobody asked me you know they didn't mention what they were doing but it was perfectly obvious and i you know all government people and all army people are just tested
and there was one fellow who just kept horsing around he seemed almost
you know a little crazy
it was it was almost comical
in my case they didn't follow me in the bathroom but apparently they were following you know the more suspicious types into the bathroom
you know because apparently people i read somewhere that you can replace your urine with warm sprite or something mountain dew and it tests you know that it tests like urine and you know it tests okay obviously
uh-huh yeah you know i mean i guess if there i guess there is something to be worried about if there's a whole science of knowing how to deal with the test
all right i like keep forgetting to make these calls i've been on this list for two months and i think i've made four calls
right
well they do have some kind of nice prizes and it's worth doing and i'm so mad i think i've had this for two months
and like i've said i've made four calls and lot of times we don't answer the phone probably when i get mine early in the evening
i really haven't seen one since probably august because every weekend in the fall we go to our high school football game on friday then we go out with friends after and that's kind of the
no and my husband dragged me to it i like i think kevin costner's a nice fellow and he's nice looking but he just to me is not a very dynamic actor
i did too i thought that was so cute and
oh i do too oh i really enjoyed that
and
oh
um-hum
oh i know it that's the way it is
we can see some pretty raunchy stuff on just regular tv without cable or even you know there's no way to protect them any more
so
oh the scary one oh yeah i didn't see that
oh really
oh i like scary ones that are realistic
oh and my kids both saw that they liked it
it was still scary oh my gosh
i know that one sounded gross i know my husband wouldn't have stood for that he likes mary poppins and things yeah
i do too i really like a variety
where you from
oh
right
i don't know they talk up there
just different um-hum
well see the accents up there fascinated me because even in his family alone there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently
and his family they lived in the same house there most of them were twenty or so you know
yeah um-hum and they lived you know they never moved into apartments when they were young they always stayed at home until they got married it seemed to be the custom up there or they went in the service and so they were together for all that time
but they still had the accents differed a little in the family
so and it
in the sixties i finally
oh really i converted him to being a texan i just thought life would be i knew it was easier back here
well sort of i'm an air force brat but i was real familiar with texas i went to college here and everything
and i just thought you know we could probably get a better house and life is a little slower a little easier and he loves it he really would never want to leave so it worked out
probably hard when you first came
was it hard when you first came
oh my
oh i know oh compared to new york oh yes
you all transferred
i have a friend down the street's from new jersey and they were he got a
okay i really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing but just off the top of my head
i've i don't think i see much wrong with it
if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had coming in were trust worthy et cetera and so on i think i would i would
probably do the random testing just to insure that my company runs safely and smoothly
um-hum
um-hum
hum
yeah that
um-hum
yeah
that's true i didn't think about that like for instance if someone's working on heavy machinery or say driving trucks or buses city buses or something like that
then that is something that affects the then affects the community
you know if you're if you're drinking or on drugs or whatever you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands
yeah
yeah for me i think that drug testing just it follows the path that society's going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs
i mean it's just it's just where society is right now and you know something we have to cope with and i think the drug testing is something that drug users have to cope with
um-hum
yeah
i think that may be
yeah that may be one of the points of it
of course i think i'm not sure you know what the time span is but i mean if i think if i used drugs last week and i had a you know had a job interview that i wouldn't use drugs the day before or something and they wouldn't even see it
you know i'm saying they can't they may not be able trace don't know how far you trace i don't know what the you know limits are or
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
hum
yeah
oh really hum
something like that yeah
um-hum hum
yeah i mean i don't use any drugs i don't really drink or anything so i'm pretty
i guess decisive about that just the fact that you if since i don't use drugs i have no problem with taking a test
that just it yeah
yeah um-hum
if you don't have anything to hide you're not going to mind it
you know but for people that
you know don't have anything to hide and then there are some things that just aren't people's business you know that they come out at that point so i think a lot of people have trouble with that
and i can i can understand that um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah
i mean i took a lie detector test once and it i didn't mind it but i was just offended by some of the questions i guess i mean there was one question do you like your mother you know i said yes do you hate your mother no have you ever killed your mother
and i was just going you know what in the world
is that what it was i just
okay
um-hum
hum
um-hum
so it kind of get kind of get something to measure my responses by i guess
yeah
um-hum
they ask that i was going what in the world are you asking me about here you know it's just
but i guess i don't know some people probably have killed their mothers i don't know but
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
hum
i don't think that some thing i mean there are some people
i mean because society a lot of people are taking drugs there is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives
but they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever
and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better you know when they might be actually trying to improve their lives you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i would probably do that and i'd probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such hospital for help or you know whatever the twelve month program or whatever it is that they do
um-hum
yeah
i'm not sure what they are either
but
um-hum yeah i the other day we had talked about
capital punishment
and i really i really hadn't thought about it i mean i think about it because i hear about it
um-hum
um-hum really
um-hum
okay it was very nice talking to you okay take care bye-bye
i have a an older son yeah he doesn't have any children yet though
he's thirty seven and i don't know if he's ever going to have any or not but i do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids
that i go out and i play ball with them
you know it's because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for them
which is kind of sad you know
so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them so i will go out and play catch with them or you know we let the dogs outside and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs
but actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids
no when my son was at home i did work and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat
you know but we always had our days off together and we went camping on vacations so we had a lot of time together that way you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah well i am sure it was you know but
i don't know what the families are really going to come to nowadays because they just there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids because most of them the father and the mother both work
you know
so it's really rough i have one neighbor that's the father is a fireman
and he works like four days on and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days
but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family you know so he's got a second job
so he's you know he's not home very often
and that's you know the kids i know miss that you know
yeah you know and i don't know i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because
you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know
but
yeah well that's good yeah that's
that's what my daughter-in-law had told me that they were going to have kids
probably after two years of marriage
so i don't know she's a nurse you know and she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids so maybe they just decided that
if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night
you know but
uh-huh
uh-huh so
right
right
uh-huh
right
yeah do you plan on staying home after you have your children or do you do you work or what
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
in dollars and lives and the long term effects
san francisco
oh nice to meet you
ready to go
what would that how would that have been different if it had been fought like a war
you think it was a winnable war then
uh-huh
you mean the effects of vietnam being to encourage him to be more defensive in his posture and go for
i meant offensive i'm sorry uh-huh
uh-huh
i do think one of the effects was that the people involved in that kind of an activity were surprised at the power that the media had on intervening and probably
set the tone for media's involvement in future whether it was a war activity or
everything changed after that in terms of media
uh-huh
well you remember in the gulf war they made a specific effort not to repeat the mistakes that the media they felt the media made in
vietnam war they weren't about to have people out in there reporting
uh-huh
uh-huh
that approach probably would have shortened the time that we were over there too at least
uh-huh
where taxes are high and services are low
i guess i'd have to say i don't think we're getting our money's worth as far as the tax system is concerned i think a lot of it is going to waste
on services that aren't necessary and out-of-date ideas that just don't make sense anymore in these times
hm
yeah it's as a matter of fact they recently in our county here our state sales tax has been seven percent
pretty much forever well they've just decided now when our county where i am is looking at upping the tax rate to eight percent to try and close a deficit that they've found in the county budget here and
you know between the increases in the sales tax and of course we have the high state tax
now we have to look into the possibility of you know it if it isn't from the bush administration with user fees it's more direct taxation
i don't know what the taxes are like down in georgia
up here considerably and you know we've had our road taxes and gas the gas tax was such a utica boondoggle being from utica you probably
well yeah it's you know roads this year have been especially bad they here in rochester they've now to save tax money and that they have turned off the expressway lights at night
well they just shoved it through here and you know to hell with people and put it into effect and then suddenly of course you know ever since every day in the newspaper here it's
people complaining you know well it was only saving two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year it's we're paying good tax money for this and
they turned it off yet they're still giving money to all these bizarre things in new york city the roads aren't any better here
and even the town here where i am in the taxes have increased again i mean they just can't push property taxes any higher that's why they're looking at this sales tax business now
oh that's not moving you know that mario up here is we're i just filled up tonight it was a dollar it's a dollar fifteen nine a gallon
well you know we also have a somewhat of a monopoly here of the gas suppliers you know anywhere else in the state it's a nickel less but they say it's going to increase around the summer time to a dollar twenty five up here
yeah
yeah we're
we're just sitting down tonight to get ours filled out we're going to do it we're going to do it and we're going to get we were doing software to do it and then you know put it off put it off
okay
okay tell me about where you live
uh-huh
yeah
although i did live in dallas for six years up until nineteen ninety and then i moved to houston
but i had lived in houston before and from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty four and worked downtown
and when i was transferred from atlanta to houston i bought a condo in southwest houston
no and i clocked it and it was only nine miles from the office and of course didn't think that would be bad but the only time i ever drove it was not during rush hour
so it was a rude awakening to me to find out what i faced every morning and every afternoon in houston traffic because where i lived in atlanta i lived right on peachtree a mile and a half from the office
and so i wasn't accustomed to commuting and it nearly killed me so whenever i moved back to houston i said i declared that i would not live where i had to drive on the freeways so now i live
in really inner city and but it's only it takes me about ten minutes to get to the office and i love it
i mean
most of the people that i work with you know commute in anywhere from
thirty to forty five minutes some of them an hour or more one way
i just i can't do it so
anyway i'm pretty content for the time being where i am
uh-huh
uh-huh that isn't bad really
yeah
right
you know it's like i said i mean i've even had people at the office ask me they say how do you justify paying the kind of money you pay for rent because i do pay a lot of money every month for rent i don't deny it
and they go you know they're jaws dropped and then and then they go and i spend way less than thirty minutes a day
round-trip commuting and you know that doesn't that's regardless of the weather if it's raining it still doesn't take me any longer i mean sometimes whenever and you know how houston is it's just so flat
and we have these torrential downpours sometimes and people literally get you know traffic gets backed up with the wrecks and everything and it'll take them an hour and a half to get to work
and they're just frayed by the time they get there i think no way so
that's right
last year i put less than twelve on my car
you know and you can really tell a difference i mean i just don't you know it's just not
i don't have that expense and by the time i cut down the cost of my insurance because my car insurance is a little bit less by living so close then the additional automobile expense
you know i love it i'll be honest with you hey
well seems to me the one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process
well sometimes strangely enough one vote has made the difference
well it's kind of strange because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day-to-day lives
well main part of the problem is they don't they think they have enough choices
you know in some of the european countries they have numbers of parties that run and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country
well maybe it's a matter of you know voter awareness
well i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long in britain you know they have a set period of time and for campaign that's it in this country it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign
well the they don't want to spend the time or they don't have the money
well it's a matter of name recognition people aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of
and even debates don't seem to help much
so we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers
well that was certainly a media event
well he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease
like what authors
uh-huh
no i'm not
oh that's interesting
no i have never really never read science fiction much
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right
that's older stuff
yeah
kind of a hush thing that she'd written this book so we all had to read it for a sociology class so no i don't the author was like madge larson or something like that it was a kind of feminist
kind of paralleled that with kind of a space version of it and it was kind of it was interesting i don't know if it was interesting just because i knew the person who'd written it or if it was actually a good book
but i've never really read a lot of science fiction it's
right
right
halfway there so that's good
uh-huh
well i'm i like a lot of contemporary short stories
authors like bobbie ann mason she's from kentucky and writes a lot of just kind of contemporary realism sort of stuff john barthelme who wrote he just died a few years ago and he wrote kind of weird avant-garde
if i'm reading kind of trashy stuff i like i guess kind of mystery books and then stuff that's funny i like pretty much any humor book
and gosh oh
oh that's fun
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah i like him
uh-huh
yeah i used to
oh what have you read by him
uh-huh
oh i've never read anything i got a book of his out of the library just the other day to try it out i'd been to england and thought you know he's like the british stephen king so oh really i'll have to
oh well he's next on my list to read i'm reading a little private eye book now
yeah
uh-huh
well that's good
right
that's one i just my very favorite book so if i had to go read something again i'd probably read moby dick or scarlet letter i also like
no i actually have never seen any of the star trek movies was that oh well that's interesting i had a roommate in school who did a did you ever see the movie heathers
oh it's kind of this sort of black comedy movie about this these kids in high school who
are not real popular and they kill all the popular kids in the class it's kind of bleak but it's sort of fun and they do a lot of moby dick i had a roommate who wrote a whole paper on moby dick and heathers and
i like john irving that's
he hasn't written much in a while but
yeah i'm trying to think what else i've read that i've really just loved
i don't know how i it's hard to read when you're in school it's like you just read those textbooks and that's it
but i guess maybe in the real world too you just don't have time to read but
uh-huh and then you fall asleep and have to reread it the next night because you forgot what you've read yeah i do that too oh i like larry mcmurtry he's good and like lonesome dove was
it was a long book but it was really good
really
uh-huh
i liked jaws and the deep and the island those were pretty good so i would read that
yeah
uh-huh
well that's interesting
that you know that's what i suspected
talking to a new yorker i thought that i'd hear someone who was totally for gun control
yeah
i used to do a lot of that it can be a lot of fun
yeah i think so
i'm not sure about sears but i know the sporting goods stores and i know sears used to sell guns i just i'm aggravated with sears right now
yeah
yeah well i grew up in new mexico and you know guns were a fact of life
my granddad hunted and what not you mentioned
that you've gotten the fire arm permit is this for a hand gun or does are there are the laws as restrictive for rifles and shot guns
i see
yeah
yeah
well you know i guess i could summarize my feelings about it as that
i would like no restrictions on me and a total ban on most people
my ex-husband would choke if he heard me say that
oh
literally yeah
right
uh-huh
i see
yeah
are you a member of the nra
is that right
my ex was a long term member of the nra
okay so you watch david letterman
well see our favorite tv show i live in a dorm and our favorite tv show is cheers
okay well we try it like here they show it like every day
and then like on thursdays is the night where the new ones come on
but we watch it like every day but i like late night we don't watch what we do is we stay up -til around one thirty and then they show the twilight zone at one thirty
and so we just stay and watch that
the what
yeah
i used i used to live in the house that the guy owned
yeah it was really it was really
oh well it was all full with shelves everywhere and we didn't have enough books to fill it up but
but so what do you like why do you like david letterman
so the
wait did you watch saturday night live what he's got what
i don't know but people the other day i went into a bar and this guy asked me to dance all he saw was my hair
and he goes do you want to dance i turn around and go what
he goes do you want to dance i go no he goes oh i'm sorry i go yeah you better be i go you better be so
but okay so wait do you watch saturday night live yesterday
yeah
no oh you missed wayne's world wayne's world was pretty cool
so let's see what else see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the tv
because we don't want to do anything like study or anything so all the all we do is turn like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the tv set you know
what
yeah
so let's see what else like the news we don't watch because they're boring
yeah especially the war i mean it was like i haven't i seen this episode before you know
yeah i know
it's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you know they're going to spend more time on doing a thing on a on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know
so but let's see what else oh we watch like for example okay do you watch star trek
okay well i used to hate star trek
i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it
but then we started watching it and like the new ones are pretty cool because they got like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind
which basketball
college or
well we got we got two teams of the acc going there
we got duke and north carolina
but i mean the i mean there's nothing to do like for example yesterday
they go some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right
i hear no we're just you know it's like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and we're watching tv and i go no today we're just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf
and bowling you know and everybody was like it was like oh god do you guys really watch that no you know i was like a whole golf tournament it's like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean
somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is five minutes
because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it's hit
okay and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play
and that's it i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know but i mean it's like that i mean it's was it's just
but when i went home that's all like they had on tv so i had to i watched entire games of baseball and they're going oh my god and tv in argentina's really bad
because i wanted to go to school here
yeah they have better computer science up here than they than they do down there
so and i also my father works for ibm and we came up here we well we came to the united states in nineteen seventy six seventy seven
and we lived here for about seven years then we moved back and so then i said i'm going to move back up there to go to college
he goes okay so he goes but do it fast so i did my undergraduate in two years yeah
and well tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks
okay
all right nice talking to you
bye-bye
oh yeah
it is this is muggy today like it wants to rain but it don't know what it wants to you know
for this time of year
no
i always do that i got to do something like that with the weather
that's right
no see that's it was a mild winter that's why i keep saying oh no
yeah i think it's going to be really hot this year
yeah
um-hum
if it rains if it rains any more and gets really hot then we have this problem with mosquitoes
see
well see i would prefer the cold
i'm from southern california
no i don't want to get that cold now
i don't think no i don't want to go no where up north no where
huh-uh
i don't even want to go anywhere yeah that's about it
that's right it's too cold up there
and then last year that's when they really had that cold spell
you know it was like
record breaking below temperatures and stuff in alaska where your car was freezing while it was running
you know the oil or the gas would turn to slush huh-uh see i can't handle that
um-hum
yeah
no something happens then what
yeah it's not that bad right now i just hope it don't get any worse
that's about it i'm just waiting because see it's tornado season
yes it is it's tornado season
um-hum you see this is this is tornado weather boy people don't know it but when it gets hot like this
and you know like they're predicting the weather to be cold well when it gets cold real fast
there's your tornados that's right and so they're predicting this weekend probably drop something like thirty degrees i say huh-uh see that ain't right
but that's tornado season
wait a while it'll change
that's right that's about like it is too because yesterday was really nice
and the wind was blowing but today is muggy but the wind is still blowing but you know
i don't know
the
that's about it that's about all you can say about the weather
that's right
all righty thank you bye-bye
okay i work with a lot of students and in my occupation talking to them about college and going to colleges i think
the advice that i give to would give to parents i've had four five sons that have gone to college
that will go along with their goals as far as what degrees they want to go into and they if they're in the local area they don't have to pay out of state tuition and all of those things
and
and
uh-huh
yes it is
um-hum
that that's kind of the advice that i give and then they need to take a look at the courses of study and how it would go into their major minor field
what kind of placement they have in the particular area you know i had one son who went to a smaller college to went out in the premed area
but they had an excellent record of placing their students in medical schools after they finished the program and he was
if he would've gone there i don't know whether he'd got accepted to medical school there or not
um-hum
yes
and you can do this for any of the any university or for any of the students that are planning take a look at their final goals at least hopefully they've got a goal of what area they want to go out in and then
if it's law school or if it's medical or whatever
there are different colleges and universities usually within the state that have a little better placement record or getting them into those higher degree or higher areas of education
i see uh-huh
um-hum you bet
and where it's well known the word gets out and that might be a case where even if it was out of state and they had to pay a little higher tuition then it would be well worth the to go to penn state
um-hum yes
and if it's financially if they can do that that's great
which ones have you seen lately
thelma and louise yeah i haven't seen that is it good
is it
yeah i i'm not familiar which billy crystal movie
yeah
that's a really good show
has jeff bridges and
really good
yeah
uh-huh
it's a i think it's put out by landmark productions the same people who put out chariots of fire
at the inca falls in south america northern argentina
really good show
yeah it's something that you know it's really stirring the cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music
oh yeah
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i found when i get when i get with my old college buddy we usually rent good gladiator movie or two
but it's fun to
oh yeah
yeah that's
that's great
oh you don't
yeah
right
yeah
that the larger states have you know like texas and california but we've got we have political clout only because of the tenure of the people that are in there like for the sub
building you know gratin and they're building down in newport now
but once somebody's got to do it somebody's got to build the subs and i guess virginia can do it also in fact i've got a
the latest contract that was awarded virginia sued or has got a lawsuit against gratin to stop construction because it was unfairly obtained or something like that you know
right
this
powell yep
yep
but when those when those people leave the power's going to go there isn't really anything here because we're not really big enough so the economy is going to going to suffer i think because the
the base that new england always had the textile base the costume jewelry base most of that now has moved out here to overseas or down south so we're prone to
recessions like the rest of the country were before we were kind of stable the political power is the only thing that can stabilize it at least i think up this neck of the woods
but there's too many now political action committees and where the money is coming from is coming from those states that have the big industries that can afford to contribute to those
so those are going to get the squeaky wheel gets the oil they're going to they're going to catch it and somebody has to do it somebody has to do the work like boeing or general dynamics or wherever they happen to be you know you've only got a few plane factories or
well i think they should be outlawed myself the packs i don't think they should be
true
oh like the yeah
yep
right yep
yeah
look at look at the tanks now look at that new abrams tank
and i have no idea what the cost is five million ten million
for each one now you can make you can make a missile or a hand held rocket that can take one of those out pretty effectively
what do we need all the tanks for
i mean you can make you can make probably a thousand rockets for each tank
and you can give a thousand rockets of a relatively untrained person and he can take he can take one of those tanks out
but yet i'm not sure who is it chrysler that makes the tanks or one of one of the
and i don't think we really need all that hardware and again like the stealth bombers and some of these things they put on their drawing boards and they never fly or they never they never run right
is it because of political clout
rather than need i think in a lot of cases yes
but we don't have a watchdog agency to the military overlooks their own testing
which is good for us i mean it creates you know we generate a lot of income at ti because of the military contacts
the savings and loans crisis
the political trends there are most of these people are lawyers that are now in
the government whether it's state or local most of them i guess you've been reading about the problems we've had in rhode island where the governor closed down a lot of the credit unions and banks
because of it was privately insured but stated
yeah there's still a lot of people that still can't get their money out
they still have to pay their bills like their mortgages and things they slip them under the door to the bank and but yet they can't get any of their savings
so it's a little bit difficult but most of the people there the trend was that on almost every single board of the institutions that were closed they were state legislators
so they had a conflict of interest because they tried to get through a bill stating that they had to have federal insurance rather than private insurance and it was squashed
although lately i've been a friend of mine that i spend a lot of time with
does recycle quite a bit and it's it it's interesting to watch some of the things that she does and then she's almost had an impact on me
paper plates and paper cups and i don't do that anymore i don't know why i just don't i just from just from socializing with her so
it really it there's not a whole lot there really isn't i know in my mother's neighborhood in san antonio each
each house they're given three baskets and they put them out on a certain day of the week
and each home does participate but we really don't have anything close in this area that do anything and some of the communities that do
the residents are having to pay to participate in it which really doesn't make sense
yeah that's good
yeah that's another thing you have to go to different places to do that
uh-huh but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that which i don't know it just doesn't make sense to me
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's good that's good
um-hum
yeah
no
oh i didn't know that
yeah
um-hum
well that's good i you know unfortunately garland doesn't have doesn't they don't i don't know they don't do anything like that or i you know i read those little slips that come in your utility bills
or your garbage collection and they haven't you know talked about doing something like that
she lives in garland and i'm not sure where what she does but she's oh she's very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
she has i really don't think she has any paper products in her house
and just a lot of things i've learned off of her that to start doing and she does make a lot of sense just her whole house is like wow
yeah
yeah
yeah and my little boy watches a program that was really neat i sat and watched him you know the barney
you know the little i don't know if you know the little character barney they had one on that kind of type of thing and how children can
and keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing he has really caught on so that's really neat
well i am basically retired now i was a member i was in education and in administration so basically i wore
dresses and heels and i was never one because my work often took me into court never was one that got accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work
but that was just me i know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants it i guess i was just old enough not to be very comfortable in it how about you
oh
um-hum
um-hum
yes
and i think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people i think you the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and more classical style of clothing
what about the miniskirt
um-hum
well there are miniskirts and there are miniskirts there are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person
as well as the shape of the person's legs
now i also even though i retired from education i do modeling and i teach at a modeling agency here
and so when we are doing wardrobing and we have two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the miniskirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job
even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through grandmothers
because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most appealing to you or the most complimentary to you
but the miniskirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want
and then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy
that's right
well i have to agree with that even when they was very popular in the early sixties i
again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore miniskirts we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers
because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those miniskirts
and so i think of course now i go the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas all the women dressed like men
with the suits and white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same
i don't like that i don't i think there should be individuality in dressing
yes
right
well i and i don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to look professional
i think that you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and overdo all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong in the at least in my opinion
in the workplace but that you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine because that was one thing i always fought against i started out as a physical education teacher
so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or mannish and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed and that pleased me
and so then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work
and what have you and be very comfortable but when i go out somewhere then unless i have a pair of dress slacks i don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans
i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how and so i just feel that you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort
but there are certain norms that companies should be able to put out as guidelines for their employees
right
yes
yes
yes
that's good
yeah um-hum
yes
right
right
yeah
did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where i was volunteering and they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up
were dressed exactly alike men and women
they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants
and one was a skirt and one was a pant and i think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality
that's can stifle creativity
so
i guess so well it's been nice talking with you
uh-huh bye-bye
all right do you do exercise
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
right
well that's a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i don't always set out for them to be exercise
i walk with my parents
occasionally nothing's real regular about this because i have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule and
i play racquetball but i haven't since i've been out of school i don't have anywhere to do that but that's going to start soon again and i play softball once a week which is it's kind of more recreation than exercise
because i really don't like to exercise i think that's the basic point of it is i'm not i don't enjoy it if i know that it's exercise but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity i don't mind
so i have to disguise it it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it that's kind of the same thing for me i have to not know that it's exercise so i can do it
well yeah if it's exercise it's a task i don't want to do anything i have to do
i mean i'll voluntarily clean the bathroom but i won't do it if i have to do it
uh-huh
right i'm twenty two
right
right
uh-huh
right
right
huh
eating right and no cholesterol and all that
yeah we i'm sure i will do i'm doing that more and more than i used to i think i'm getting
i'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it but it's still at the task stage
is it a pleasure for you or are you
hum
right
right
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
right
right that's i never got past that stage
right
uh-huh
right
that's good
yeah
uh-huh
right that's it i do the occasional push up and sit up i haven't really brought myself to go to the gym because that's very stressful to me because i feel
i felt real competitive there and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are
yeah
right
uh-huh
right
right
uh-huh
that's a good idea but i do have my ride we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house
i'll do those once in a while just you know like at eleven thirty when love connection is on and i can't sleep i'll get up and stair step for half an hour so
it's i guess pretty healthy but i don't have an a regular plan that's
i need to get started on that
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
sleep
uh-huh
yeah
right
that'll come some day when i
right
well i hope so yeah sounds good
yeah you too have a nice day bye
well let's see
five
well any number is nice let me tell you
yeah it's not as fair to the children either i don't think
oh
yeah but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
you can tell
how to just entertain themselves
yeah
it's a problem for any child and you take one that's used to being
busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference
keeps you busy
yeah
well that's great
no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and
right now i feel the main thing is to look at what they're interested in and take what they're interested in and then start looking for schools
no not necessarily
and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to embrey riddle and we talked him into going local here first
and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing but right now of course he's working for pratt and whitney in connecticut and they build and rebuild jet engines
the other ones the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to we didn't want her to go but she went to erie to gannan university or gannan college i'm not sure which it is college i guess
she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like clarion she came back and finished at clarion
because it saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted
and our other two boys they went to clarion also and did very well there
and they've all really got
they've all really got really good jobs
and
uh-huh
yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go daphne never went she always said she would never go to college
she said i always thought she'd change her mind you know but she didn't and there's nothing wrong with that you know if college isn't for everybody
but it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it's what they want out of life
because if they get an education
and are willing to go where the jobs are
they can make a you know a much better income
like my kids they're all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state
you know that boggles my mind
uh-huh
okay did you go to college
you did see it makes a difference
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
someplace else
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's great
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
different life styles yes yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
it's quite a bit different
see that's the way we are we're more of a rural type of a area
and it does make a difference
i they say you shouldn't look at the expense of the college when you are looking
yeah not really because they say a lot of times you -an get more help
with a more expensive college
and so in the long run if it's really what they want
you know they're better off now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school we did all we could
but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go
and the water heater upstairs in the attic it had a little leak and leaked down in under the ceiling
and they had to come in and do some tape and bedding and repaint you know treat the ceiling but nothing major those kind of things really weren't major just some of those kind of things that can happen
but just getting him out there to finish up and that sort of thing was has been a real effort
uh-huh
it's hard it's hard to make it fit perfectly
well fortunately ours was on the ceiling where they had the blow in ceiling the little
the little the little you know styrofoam balls that they paint over so it was easy to disguise that but it was in an area where you don't really look at very much so we were lucky in that respect
no however i do think that a lot of times contractors try to get out of doing things that they say they're going to do and
yeah and then they don't do a real good job doing it too they just kind of get it done as quickly as possible
yeah they i like when they come in of course i designed my own house i'm i i've had prior experience in design and building and stuff like that so i know basically if it's done right the problem is i don't want to do anymore
i want someone to do it for me
and just trying to get them to do what they say they're going to do is a real effort
well i could recommend something there if you know if it's not just cost prohibitive
for you i've built probably three decks on three different houses
and the first time i went with
regular just treated pine
kind of a womanized pine and then i spray treated it with some
panta oil which you have to do about every two years
the problem with that is it warps after a couple of years then and you have to start replacing boards
the second time i did it out of cedar which i soaked in thompson water seal
and that works fine but there again it discolors real bad
you know the sun and everything else it just makes it look gray and dull an and it doesn't look attractive after a few years the wood lasts fine but the color i was real dissatisfied
and if you can stand the additional expense which you'll recoup after a while because it will last forever is the redwood if you'll go with the redwood
they're screws the self adhesive screws all right
you have to pretty much spray them regularly you know under an and around or whatever so you want to leave yourself enough space to get under it or be able to lift it up
on some ends a lot of times they won't even detach them to the ground they just lay them up on some cinder blocks underneath in the ground
and they're heavy enough where they won't the wind won't pick them up or they won't shift if it's big enough and heavy enough
so they're several ways of doing it but the redwood is by far the best and i would and i would also insist on that they do treat that with thompson's water seal
yeah
yeah
well it is it's a frightening experience
the one thing you might do if he will deliver the boards that he is going to make the under structure with
before he starts doing the construction to go ahead and do the water seal
on those and then when he cuts them and puts them together then that'll already be treated and a fast way of doing that if you'll go get a piece of guttering material like a little trough
and cover both ends or some sort of something that will fit in
and
pour that in pour the thompson's water seal in there and then just put that in there and turn them over several times and let them set and soak in
that's right that works wonders it i know it takes a lot of extra time but it's by far worth it
well over a period of time any lumber will deteriorate
now redwood would take quite a few years it depends on how many years you plan to stay there
but redwood even if you don't treat it properly will begin to discolor and will begin to degrade even though it will be strong structurally strong and will be there for a lot longer
actually if you do the water seal correctly
you don't even have to do that
i've seen decks that are ten years old that still have never had the had the water proof stain put back over it or whatever
and or they even have some rejuvenator that you can put on there that makes the redwood color come back but it's expensive and most cases if you do it properly it will not even be required
yeah and the thompson's is good because you can roll it on with a roller you can spray it on you can
or a mop anything you can put that on with anything whereas a lot of this other stuff you have to you have to actually sit down and paint it with a brush
and or spray it but then you've got to worry about the over spray whereas this stuff is clear
even if you got it on the side of some of your bricks or on your concrete it wouldn't hurt anything
you would never be able to know it so
well it it's kind of fun though things like that especially something like that where you're outside you're not worrying about something inside the house that you can mess up outside you can learn a lot by doing that
well and it's and it could be cheaper in the long run and
oh
uh-huh and did you were you happy with the van you
oh uh-huh
right
did they use a lot of gas those vans
um-hum
oh that is pretty good
oh that
oh yeah that is nice i thought they used a lot more gas than that ah
no
a new baby and so the car that we have only has the five seat belts and we need you know when we're all going in it we need six
so we're looking for something bigger and i
i don't know we have a little honda car that my husband uses
right and it's been such a good car but i wish they made hondas with the six seat belts i don't i don't think they make them that big
oh
oh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
right
so that's i was kind of i my preference would to be just to go to a bigger car i think rather than rather than a van but you know even that is it's hard to find a car that is big enough i guess
the problem we have now is our car it doesn't have a bench seat up front so if we had the bench seat then we would be fine but when we bought it we
we didn't get the bench seat up front so
eight uh-huh
right
uh-huh
that's true
that's true i haven't i haven't thought about that because is there a lot more room in the regular size vans than in a car
oh
uh-huh
oh so now why did you go with a large conversion van when you went
um-hum
oh
oh
uh-huh
oh
right did you buy it new was it
oh and that's only about a thousand dollars difference
yeah that surprises me too
um-hum
uh-huh
my word
nineteen so that's still comparable
wow
all of their entrees are wonderful have you ever heard of that place
yeah there's another one over here real close to my house at walnut and shiloh but they've built some more there's one over in the hurst area of fort worth and
yeah
yeah it is the atmosphere is okay i mean it's kind of dark and has candle lit tables and that kind of thing but it's not a real fancy place you know it's just the food is just really exceptional and they give you real big quantities
and it and all their entrees come with like a salad and soup and all the rolls you can eat and so by the time you get your food you're already full
oh well you could go there what i do sometimes for lunch is just get like soup and salad and eat their garlic bread because it's so delicious yeah
yeah well what's your favorite place
oh you like mexican i like that too
oh
yeah
uh-huh yeah
well that's neat
yeah well that's my main thing too
yeah
yeah that is a real noisy place
yeah
oh uh-huh
yeah
so i spend time at those places too because i know how much they enjoy we go to show biz a lot but do you have children
right that's right it they have a wonderful area to play you know they have big balls and games and rides and i mean all kinds of stuff it's like a little bitty amusement park in there
uh-huh right have it at home yeah
yeah i know i don't like domino's either
so
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh you do
is it northeast or
oh okay yeah that's really not that far from garland just
huh okay
well i don't know if i know anything or not but i've got some opinions on it see those type of people that have the most opinions ones at don't know anything
well i've had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective
i think this me generation has gone far too far and the young people are overly impressed
and i think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint
i personally know nothing about the peace corps though
but they have i read somewhere
and i'm out on a limb here some type of college
volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the
lower income brackets of the united states have you ever heard about that one
oh really
and this is money that she's borrowed for her college education
but she got credits for it
that's very interesting
hum
yeah i think that is an excellent program i really do i like that and it's beneficial to the small towns too because they really
have a disadvantage that we don't understand because we're in the metroplex
right you know if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient
but we could find one we wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that
so i can see the advantage to that one
the peace corps itself is really dying out isn't it
it's still in existence
i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm
dig their own wells set up their schools
yes they it's not
a program to teach them to use the american money it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant
and yes you're right i think it's a sixties program i think it was one of kennedy's hot points that he that was his big deal
right
i think i i've
singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're pretty good
along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good
but there's a
mandatory just like the draft no
every time you
they could buy their way out
right you know they they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat but
i'm wondering if there's another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out
can you go into and this wasn't the question but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults
can they go in there and can anyone
go into
well out of the kurdish community is a little bit of extreme at this time but say i think bangladesh would have been a good example
or some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and doesn't do any good
i don't know that it does
i don't know that
if you step back from the current issue and look at it
more intellectually
there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out
you know we're losing certain races of people there are people now
that are obsolete point and fact just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people
that are endangered or obsolete
and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out there's a german word for it that's elegant but i never can remember what it was
but they're being winnowed because they're where they are they're not adapted to their environment
essentially
and
one of the quick examples is the aborigines
when we were in australia
sad little things
i felt sorry for them
because their society isn't there anymore and their belief system and all their structured of theirs all the structures of their society are gone
essentially
and they're just kind of
more like a side show than anything else and that's sad but i don't think there's any way you could go the peace corps could go in and rescue those people and i don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
so i i'm wondering if the peace corps is really an effective tool
good point we've got enough without a passport there's plenty
yes i think we ought to worry about our own species
i wonder now in and i've been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses
that's the last thing you want to do
yeah that's exactly it
they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come on let's be realistic that's just not realistic
right
no we're not i don't think i think that's more realistic than going making them go in the peace corps
i think that's a lot more realistic
i think that we should be spending more time and again i don't think the peace corps is as successful now simply because
it's not
it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore
we've got plenty
in fact we've got far too many
i was that's exactly what i was going to ask you have you ever have you been downtown
well i tell you what that's count your blessings because it's really is good when someone can do some
things to the car themselves
well that's why i don't do as much as i'd like
because they are i mean they got they've gotten complicated haven't they
uh-huh
is that right
do i could always do the alternator you know and starter i don't anymore but i have on a lot of times
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
it probably slipped loose -idn't it
uh-huh
um-hum
hm
oh
um-hum
well it really wasn't quite as bad as you thought would it was it
well it was a lot of money but
you had to have the help didn't you yeah
disposal is a problem
that's true that's true
right that i've quit doing that myself and but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil you know
it's
i think life now i grew up on a farm i don't what kind did you up in the farm
uh-huh
i see i see well little bit different i think though it was much slower and
much more self-contained
uh-huh
yes
unreal by comparison
yeah i think that's right i can remember as a child you know nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go
it wasn't it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me they were
no
it's not all that long ago is it
uh-huh
yeah we were living in new jersey
in twenty years ago
in allendal
and i use to have to go over to patterson when those riots were going on at sometimes
i don't know though it's kind of hard to really know because of though the news media had those riots
kind of blown up out of proportion
because i went there many times and i never i never saw a riot
did you
that's what yeah well huh
uh-huh
yeah i think that's true i think that's true
i think the other thing is that
we have taken some rather drastic turns in our in our education and the way we approach things as of
maybe starting back when i'm number one you know and worrying about the self and not
seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family
and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged
closeness of families and support
for young people that the kind of support that they need to help them take care of the things if you don't have some kind of
of basic belief or something down inside of you then it's very difficult to
to have anything to turn to when you got when you've got something facing you like that
uh-huh
right
now exactly
yeah
that's right that's right
no
that's right
oh
no there's so much more then that it starts very much deeper then that i think that too i see some flickers of
of
of good directions turning
but whether they're soon enough and fast enough i don't know it's just
right
uh-huh
yeah that's right
right
and there's so much so many people on the lower end of those who are going to be the drop outs and the
and the poor and the homeless and whatnot
yeah that's just another
yeah
it really is it's just it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think of
of the jobs that is out there to be done
in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be
not that i really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago but
yeah just the volume makes a big difference i
as mother you know i use to think sometimes it's not so much
it's not so much the kids it's just the volume of it to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and you know and
right
right and children's lives were simpler because mother was there somebody was there
and when there's nobody there i always thought too that you know people worrying about going to work when their child when their children are little
and i and i think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much
but i believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go to go work was when they were teenagers
right it's not so much that they come to you every minute but it's that you are there when they need you
yeah
yeah
yes i think that's true
yeah that's
yeah
well
but that helps a lot i have a daughter who just had a second job she needed need to work and she
opted to go into a day care center where she could take her children with her
and
and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them and
but i think that's really important i don't think people realize how important it is
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think that's right what was what is your name again
linda
okay
well i think probably that we've just about
yes it's nice talking to you too bye now
hello
this is marilyn spivey richardson texas
let's see now what do i do push
push one okay hold on
okay are you there
well do you subscribe to any magazines
which ones do you
oh how many soap operas do you listen to
oh and so you can keep up with when you miss with that
oh i see do you subscribe to any others
oh
now what do you find out in that because i haven't read that one
um-hum
oh uh-huh
okay well i only subscribe to two one of them is people magazine
um-hum
well it's good light reading and since our business is at the house i when i'm eating lunch i like to read one or the other you know comes in the mail once a week and that's what i read when i eat my lunch
yeah i used to years ago read like ladies home journal and mccall's and some of those but i
i just kind of stick to these two now but you know because they come to i do subscribe and they come once a week so you know they're and i don't really have time to read anymore
you mean the two that i subscribe to
oh well now i guess i just pick out and read out of both of them what interests me there's an article about
something way out in the national enquirer or something i just you know i just don't read it i just read the ones that sound interesting to me usually about movie stars or famous people
yeah now that that's true there is a lot of those i don't pay any i don't read those much either
um-hum
yeah although it's getting rather expensive since on the last time i had to
i'll just buy the ones off the newsstand then once a month or something when there's something i'm especially interested in reading about you know
okay so does your mother still take people magazine
right
yeah
they're all so much more than they used to be years ago years ago i think people read a lot more magazines
but
well that's
that's true
yeah
uh-huh and it's more as i can think more people do i think just read books
so
well let's see if you were going to subscribe to a magazine which one would you pick other than the ones that you are reading
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
starting to save now
okay you want to go first
yeah sure is
yeah it is
of course you you've had your fair share of that down your way too
no argument here yeah i think that now i'm no financial expert but from what i've read and heard
yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed savings and loans to make
riskier
investments and of course oil was one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that
without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went down
well also in investments in oil ventures as well because it was predicated on a certain price per barrel
to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to
twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasn't any way to break even
yeah
yeah
yep
didn't they just put another thirty billion dollar band-aid on the problem last week or something
president approved some more money to bail them out
well that's true
of course it just adds to the to the annual deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation
and at some point in time
it's either going to be repaid or just completely blown off
i'm not sure which one is which i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse
yeah now i i'm a staunch republican but you know for the last nine years i've heard that we would grow our way out of out of debt
and after the longest sustained economic recovery in i don't know how many decades it didn't happen
and
i don't know what it's going to take to turn that around
yeah i think ending the gulf war quickly was beneficial
definitely
do we think enough is being done to address it i
i guess it had some blue ribbon panels look into it i don't i don't remember exactly what their findings and recommendations were
right
sure
that's true although of course the last six months the headlines have been pretty well dominated by the persian gulf
maybe now that we're putting that behind us that we'll be able to address this in more depth
sure
well hey it's been real good talking with you
oh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that
oh
what's the
yeah
what's the minimum is that like three minutes
oh okay
i think so too
you bet bye-bye
to let you know what i feel about drug testing i have my qualms about having the government or anyone else for that matter
testing randomly everybody across the board for various drugs however i am not against
testing those people who are in critical jobs for example airline pilots subway drivers you know people who are responsible for other people's safety
correct i just think that it's
unnecessary and really the medical testing facilities that are available now have been shown to have problems in the past as far as reliability is concerned
and we have had situations here where people were accused of
utilizing drugs and it turned out they were on some other medication which was giving false positives
um-hum
do you more or less follow on the same lines as i do or
yeah i know that they were up here in new york
i've noticed what they have been trying to do the governor here isn't thrilled with the idea and we have
various government officials here who basically don't feel that is a good idea for along the same lines but they're continuously clashing with the federal government which because of it's antidrug war
figures well since we're not really accomplishing much of anything internationally let's make big headlines by going out and being for mandatory drug testing and
of trying to really do something and through education and that
yeah they the federal government seems to be a lot more aggressive about this
than anything else it's interesting that you find out with all these little scandals going on now such as in the house with the post office cocaine scandal
you know all that
oh really
yeah i
yeah
courtesy of the federal government as time goes on because of the almighty rights of the employer to know every possible thing about their employees
yeah i don't know how much you've had experience as far as in the newspapers coming across people who have gotten into trouble with the drug stuff here in rochester
in western new york there hasn't been a terrible lot but we of course hear about the subway drivers in new york city
who slammed into someone and of course you know the airline pilots are rumored you know there are already rumors of rampant alcoholism now cocaine usage
i got her for christmas from my family and back when we lived in nebraska i like to hunt and so
do you have a pet now
oh
what kind of cat is it
uh-huh
being born outside you didn't have any problems house training them
that's good
sure
well we went to a cat show at the plano center here in town and we thought that we have a cat now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we'd want something kind of unique so
we kind of looked around and they had everything from hairless cats to siamese cats and persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the maine coon cats
they're huge
oh
i'll be darned i didn't know that
that's interesting we kind of like well my family didn't necessarily like them as much as i did but the manx is that the one that doesn't have a tail it sort of has a bob tail i kind of like that too but
well i'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog and then i suppose our five minutes will be up huh i
work for a university and i went to omaha nebraska to recruit students and i had some time off in the afternoon so i went to a pet shop
and i saw these little springer spaniels and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have so when i got back home to carney nebraska
i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university and one of the people that we went with they were friends of ours and so
we got to omaha and i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog and
so i got over there and she said oh that's too bad the dog has already been sold and i didn't realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room
and so that night we had a reception for some of the potential high school students or college students and
and he had the dog the whole time in his room and i had no idea and so we headed back to carney that night and
the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car and i guess while we were inside eating
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
hm
it sounds nice
oh yeah
yeah well you know these guys that gambled high lost big you know
and
i'm insulating myself from that problem i'm building my own house
and as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision
yeah
yeah i used to be a builder
and i retired about five years ago
and started college
so you know i decided this summer that you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so i did
and see the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own
well
as you know anything that involves the government is works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much right hence the savings and loan problem we have today
but you know my home is fairly simple it's designed to be added on to
yeah
well i figure it's just me and my wife but you know i like to do stuff with my hands and what not so i'm gonna have a shop
ten acres
well yes it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor he's on the other side of a hill
and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon
seriously
and well in the winter time i can see another guy but you know he's
you know i can just make out his place you know
i got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten mile to the
north
and
because the house has no heating or air conditioning
well it's got a very small furnace and a i'm use a wood burning stove as well but
in the house itself i've been working inside you know these low these many months and i have not had to use the heat
because it's all geothermal
and with all the see i've got on the south side is all glass well as much as i could get in it you know
and the east side is glass i've got one two three four five six windows in the east side on forty eight feet so it's almost all glass
and
oh yeah i mean you know
there's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows
so
well not really it's on the side of a hill
so the first you know the what i call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep
and the side that's on the other side is about six feet high
so i got a pretty good grade there and then when i put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop
so
exactly yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
okay
pretty much i like the thirty minute sitcoms in the evenings i mean i don't i don't get to watch them a lot but i do watch murphy brown and designing women
so what do you watch
oh yeah i love it but it comes on so late
oh really what at the at ten thirty oh well i'll have to watch that then
yeah
yeah
oh really yeah channel thirteen had on a thing about astronomy that was really neat but i didn't get to see all the parts
huh
oh
yeah
well that's pretty neat yeah i don't even know when that comes on anymore
oh really hm well we go to the lake a lot so when i don't get to see it that much tv in the summertime and plus everything is in reruns anyway so i guess it works out
yeah
oh yeah i love nickelodeon but they get that but where they live they live out in the boondocks of oklahoma and they don't get the disney channel
oh really yeah it was neat
oh i didn't realize that
yeah
yeah
oh i do too i mean i've got high society on tape that i taped and you know all the older ones
sit back and watch the old musicals
oh yeah because that does happen a lot there is nothing on anywhere on cable or anything
hm
yeah
i get almost all well the majority of my news from radio and news letters which is kind of unusual but it's a pretty cost or time effective way to do it because on tv you have to put up with all the happy talk and the commercials
and then on like newspapers well they just take too long to read i use to read news papers very faithfully but i just ran out of time so i tape record all things considered from national public radio
and i when i ride the bike ride my bike to campus i have it on my walkman and that gives me one side of the news and to get the other side i get a bunch of news letters from organizations which are mostly on the right
and how about you
um-hum
um-hum
hm
all the all the aids cases in miami for example
yeah that's right well i mean the only thing about them is that they the their news
most of the time tends to be pretty slanted to the left and you just can't tell really what's happening for i mean take for example the economy where they've not them alone but
most of the news media but probably they more strongly than a lot of the others
have all these programs about bad economic news and as soon as the news gets good it just disappears you know just don't report it to the same extent that they do about the bad news
hm i don't know but i think that for example after the
after the iran iraq war when oil prices came way down i think it would have been news that oil company profits decreased as i'm sure they did you just didn't hear about it
so i get pretty upset with them actually a lot but the only thing is there's no other game in town except for monitor which is you know about the christian science monitor program
no on radio they have an hour a day news program
but that's
i'm sorry
right yeah that it i don't think they well i mean i know they don't broadcast it here at all and the only way that i can ever listen to that is when i'm in another part of the country so
you know i mean they're really the only game in town and if you want to get different news for an hour or a little bit more than an hour that's
that's about the only way to do it which i find kind of unfortunate now there is the mcneil lehrer news hour but that's on tv and then you've got to be sitting there
yeah
um-hum
yeah well at least it's not the same slant is all things considered huh
so that's true yeah now i like the wall street journal if i subscribed well let's see if i subscribed to a newspaper i probably would get it it's it'd be that or usa today but
they have good in depth articles mostly on things that have to do with you know credit cards or other things relating to financial things or financial planning but they also have some good in depth articles beginning on page one
um-hum
right
i was discussing actually one of those stories with i just happen to i don't know how i acquired a wall street journal it just happened last month there was a story on recycling i think actually that was a column one story though
but that talked about the way that some communities are trying to recycle so much that they don't have anybody to buy the stuff from them to reprocess and in one locality i think it was portland ended up burning
the stuff some of it some of it because there's nothing else they could do with it
yeah
so it was it was you know good to find out a little bit more than you would in certainly in any story on network news i mean not just
that was the only thing but it was it was good discussion of the markets for various recycled products
in order to go into this sort of specialized curriculum where we're teaching kids
not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in going into a career
about and the problem comes about if these people aren't well rounded students or graduates that sort of traps them in the field that they've spent all this time being educated in
uh-huh
yeah that's it's i'm only twenty four years old so i've was through a lot of that although
and they drilled into our heads and the same thing with the college that i went to get as broad of an education as possible so that you're down with the basics and then once you know what you want to do then
try and get some specific courses but i remember one of the things that they were always drilling into us was the need to learn how to communicate effectively through writing
you know it's some of these things that and i've seen papers that in sixth grade i wouldn't have had returned to me which are getting a's in college today the standards have really fallen
huh
the writing they what they would do is they would focus in on our particular problems on the college level course and
would then work with us as far as fixing those things i had a problem with writing excessive verbiage
in my writing and i they taught me basically how to pair it down a little bit and i don't see that in a broader
you know even in a public school situation because a lot of the teachers have these large classes that they can't devote the individual attention to each student that they may have twenty or thirty years ago
i remember large group in certain courses mainly political science we'd have lectures where there'd be three hundred students
and if you had a question you know or didn't understand it at all of course you're not going to raise your hand in a three hundred group
and i think you know it's those kinds of things that
i i'm not sure how we go about fixing something like that other than maybe devoting some more
resources into first of all getting the teachers reasonable salaries and expecting in return some sort of standard
and you know some proof that what they're doing is actually worth what we want to pay them
and then try and get maybe more involvement with the parents
well how are the schools down in your area these days
okay
is it
it takes some getting used to
so
do you have any ideas that you could offer me on a dinner party or whatever
barbecue hamburgers
that's that you know pretty straight forward and simple
um-hum
yeah sometimes you know the time consuming stuff can be the worst things to go for especially when you have a group of people
i usually stick mainly with something i can put on the grill usually i'll get a
and put them on skewer sticks
i usually marinate them for overnight or something like that so that all the juices and stuff you know soak in real good
i usually i use a combination i i've tried this on several things but i use a teriyaki sauce
and i use a little bit of a good red wine
and put a little sugar in there and a little worcestershire sauce
and garlic and pepper
and then i mix all that up and then i just soak the meat in it i put it in a bowl where the meat is totally submerged in this marinade
and i usually keep it in there about twenty four hours
and then i just when i get ready to cook them i just put them on the sticks then and then i put a little bell pepper a little yellow bell pepper between each piece of meat or every few pieces or whatever
yeah or just you can just you can use your imagination on that kind of stuff
then i marinate mushrooms the same way i use the same mixture but i just add i add a little butter in with the mushrooms and saute those to kind of
put over the steak do what
and it it's real good my wife likes it real well i've i do most the cooking in our house anyway
it's just something i've enjoyed doing over the over the years and usually i'll just i'll serve something like a salad and some potatoes i take new potatoes and i'll steam those
i'll leave the peel on them and steam those and then i'll pour some frozen peas
frozen peas
and i'll steam those just after just when the potatoes are about done i'll put those in there with it and steam those with them at the same time
and then pour them into a bowl and mix butter in there with those that's real good
and then just a regular salad of some sort
and usually everybody you know that usually everybody likes that some of those types of combinations
then some kind of dessert whatever and usually wine or beer or whatever
my best simple one
let's see probably
stir fried beef
i usually do that in a wok it's real fast you can you can do the whole thing in probably thirty minutes
is it is it the electric wok or the one that you put on top of the burners
oh i know yeah i know which one you're talking about now what i actually what i use is my wife is oriental
and we've tried all that stuff the only problem is it's so messy the cleanup from all that takes twice as long as what the cooking does
so we just use we have an electric wok
and it does it does as good as anything
yeah they're easy to clean you know they have the nonstick coating on it and then i also
have a rice cooker you can buy a rice cooker and it cooks rice perfectly except you have to buy the rice in an oriental store because it takes a special type of rice
no i do that too
she likes it so-so
i she usually tells me what she likes and she's taught me how to do some of her things over the years
no she doesn't she likes hot spicy stuff so i've learned to cook a few of her the type meals that she likes egg rolls and things like that
they're not really that tough after you after you do it about two or three times the first few times learn how to wrap them and everything else that that's really the key it's what goes in it is very simple
i usually make mine with pork
chopped pork and chopped shrimp mixed and then i put you know mushrooms and carrots bean sprouts cabbage
then
just about anything actually
well those you the wraps come already premade in the oriental store and they're called egg roll egg roll wraps
it's made out of like a wheat paper
and you just put the stuff in there in the middle you just take a spoonful of it and put it in the middle kind of form it you know like a tube
and then kind of roll it up and wrap the edges around it and roll it up all the way and then put a little bit of egg
the egg white
raw egg white on it and hold you know hold it you know in place
do what
well you can just take you know that little spoon or whatever and just take a little on the edge of it just rub it on the edge of it and then tighten it
you can even just dip a little flap of it in there it doesn't really make it doesn't take a whole lot
but it's then you just deep fry them until they're done
and that should just you have to kind of taste one to see you know see if it's done or not
but
there's all kinds of neat little stuff i mean i enjoy it i just i get in the kitchen sometimes just try new stuff and if it doesn't turn out very good i just don't do it anymore
do what now
oh really my daughter loves that stuff
um-hum
well you know not many people put you know put tomatoes in their spaghetti sauce i put them in there all the time
i love i love tomatoes in there i usually buy these
oh they're cans of these diced tomatoes
yeah well they're actually they they're canned tomatoes but they're they call and they dice and they're small
and then they have other stuff in there with them green peppers and stuff i just toss one of those in there
do what
they're kind of like rotel but i can't remember their what brand they are they're
yeah same sort of thing
then i just you know put whatever kind of meat i use sometimes i use italian sausage or you use ground beef or i'll even make sometimes i'll even make the meatballs
uh-huh
it's good
the italian sausage
oh i agree it's good
yeah
i use deer sausage too
i make the tube deer sausage every year and i even cut it up and do the same thing
well i mean i'm if i have time i am if i'm if i'm if i don't have time or i'm in a hurry i can't stand it i'd rather just go out to eat but if i've got a saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon i like i like to plan something and do it
but
cookout everyday
oh yeah
well i use see i use my outside grill probably three nights a week
that's
i used to not use it so much but when i got my gas grill i used it a lot when i have to fool with charcoal i don't want any part of it
that electric i mean gas grill i love it
well i put these i do throw a couple cubes of charcoal you know this
and hickory chips and stuff like that in there which does give it the appearance but i just i like the i like to be able to push the starter and have it light up
because it smokes real a whole lot and that smoked flavor gets up into the meat
if you got time and the
yeah i think so i don't know well i'm not one in finances first of all and but i do try to keep a family budget what about you
well that's the way with us that's why i said i try to keep one with my husband isn't working and yeah and it makes it real tough you're right
well i rob peter to pay paul i pay the utilities and the most biggest bills at the first of the month
and then i look buy the groceries and the smaller bills like middle of the month but i have it exed out to last me for the whole month
and he works contract work occasionally so that helps he's an electronics engineer an electronics engineer
and he works mainly on aircraft and he was working with eastern and eastern went bankrupt
so yeah so
he said he
yeah
that's true
what kind of work do you do
oh uh-huh
that makes it really hard too
do you ever try to hit a long shot like in lottery or races or anything like that
have it to do it right hm yeah
publisher's warehouse i never send those either but i thought well maybe you do have a chance after all
but
um-hum
yes we do
yes
yeah well when we bought the real estate was really high and now with the last appraisal we got and everything it really went down so that if we would've tried to go on a market we'd have lost money
uh-huh
um-hum
i'm trying to hang in there
does your where -oes your wife work
oh
yeah
you know about computers
you are
well good you can talk about it more than i can i don't own a computer but i'm in college right now and my boss has an ibm that she has me type letters on a lot and i do a lot of merging with addresses and letters and
wordperfect
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh what do you do for a living do you use it in that
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh
so i panicked called the main office borrowed their's so i could go ahead and print out the documents
but i'm interviewing i interviewed i had an i'm a music major and i had an audition yesterday at baylor university it's a private baptist christian school
in texas in waco and so that went real well
oh really
oh my goodness
oh my goodness
that's great
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
oh my goodness
well did you take music classes in college
well my goodness that's wonderful i hope
uh-huh
so does she want to do that or does she want to get into opera
oh okay see what i'm i want to do is get my bachelor's in music theory possibly music theory and if not that then music
now we talking about is this the nba this is college okay
um-hum
and see that's probably all i like saw while i we have moved in the last couple years from utah to texas and there's so many colleges and universities in texas we haven't really
the mailman or karl malone was you know pretty big thing and the lakers have always been amazing to watch
no i did keep track a little bit of the mavericks they've
not had any good seasons for a long time and have a lot of problems with tarpley and maybe now that that's over they'll come out of it but
yeah i hope they do something they need to or they're not going to have any esteem left at all
yeah kind of like the cowboys i guess
yeah they coming out of it this year we'll see if it holds on
the bulls
well they did well
it's yeah
it is it is and that's why i've i guess my mind went blank it's like last season was so long ago and i haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet so
but this wasn't a good subject but we'll see how our predictions come true
okay it's good talking to you
alrighty bye-bye
well there is an argument in that a judge has seen a lot more cases and you know perhaps he sees one crime
and he can compare that crime to you know his long history of dealing with criminals and
the jury you know this is you maybe they've sat on sat on a jury once before maybe this is their very first time the only they've really seen is like gaudy on tv or something like that you know and they just you know they just kind of
you know making guesses how bad they think it is
yeah as uniformed i mean he would he would
figure out the severity based upon his own personal scale the only thing i worry about is like one
one murderer or let's say one thief
getting like
a tenth of the penalty of another thief simply because perhaps he impressed the jury more or you know just because his presentation was better
yeah
exactly
see i would almost argue i would consider i don't i don't know i haven't thought it out long enough to figure out all the ramifications but getting rid of the entire trial by jury and having the judge decide guilty or not guilty
yeah but i think the we the people that our founding fathers were talking about were rich white males
i mean i don't think
i don't think they had a real high opinion of the masses i mean hamilton was a prime case you know he didn't i think he referred to them as the mindless he didn't want them to vote he didn't want them to have any say in government
right
you know that never occurred to me
well i mean only one it seems like a needless step but i think there's only been one person who haven't voted as he was voted into or there's only i think only been one electoral vote that was not voted at in the electoral college
as the propular the popular vote was voted
so
i really don't know enough about the middle east to form solid opinions but i don't how about you do you have a solid opinions on us involvement
uh-huh
totally different world
hm
so you're saying that the coalition forces should've got went ahead and gone in and taken out iraq instead of just recapturing kuwait
yeah and well bad thing is i mean you can't do that because the saudis asked you know the saudis were helping you know out
on only under the condition that they would help that the united states and the coalition force would help kuwait regain their country
and otherwise
right
and plus you know it's illegal you know in
in warfare or any or any other kind of international
to go against the to exactly you can't go after the leader you can't legally do that i mean then again you know there's people who say war is war everything's fair
but that's just not it's like some you know a geneva convention or something like that said it
uh-huh
yeah
but
yeah it's but it's very hard to deal with people that don't believe in the same things and don't live the same way that you do you know it's like as we think that
saddam hussein ruined the country and that
that iraq would be much better with a democracy so that the people could decide what they want
but then again you got you have all the palestinians that think that this saddam hussein is a you know is a god is someone that's going to relieve them of all their troubles and how can you get across to people that
think that you know their savior you're telling them that their savior
is a person of empty promises you can't you know it's hard it's hard to do that so it's hard to change a country especially in the middle east which has different views on life
getting him out yeah
uh-huh
i think i think the united states should stick around and play a role but i don't think that united states should get directly involved from now on they should kind of stay on the outside of
of the events you know kind of
i don't know how to say how to say it exactly in words but you know just kind of stay with one eye looking in the situation make sure that
united states can go in when need be you know it's not like we'll be ready if they ever ask for help
uh-huh
uh-huh
so there's already some trouble brewing huh
yeah
yeah
you mean after the cease fire
well i think
yeah the well i think they also shot down some gunships is that what you're talking about the helicopter gun ships that they shot down
because what i heard was that the that the military was shooting down civilians and anti hussein
troops with gun ships
it's a mess it's hard it's hard for two different societies to get together and try to help each other mutually when they don't agree on so many things
and then you know and then and especially with the middle east the way it is they the too -sane you know these the arabs are fighting amongst themselves and then one arab decides to ask
a non arab for help and that just kind of turns everybody else against them like you know that's why the palestinians were rooting for or were pulling for hussein because they're all arabs
and they really didn't like the idea of the united states coming in and helping out kuwait who was so rich
yeah
yeah
oh well
yeah i think we did the right thing
right
well i think it deterred i think it deterred hussein from doing anything else because if for example we let hussein go in there and take kuwait then
it could have been just like you know world war two it may you know because hitler got little bit of what he wanted here he'd try it again and got some more he'd try again and got some more
right
right
yeah
yeah because they don't have anything to lose so they'll go ahead and use them
um-hum
but they have less to lose if they use them you know it's like they're third world countries they you know they they're like their people are in bad shape well we'll go ahead and use it and
put some other country in our shape see that's the way they think
so
yeah
it'll be interesting to see how it turns out now you know who does what if hussein actually stays in power or not
yeah
yeah
we'll see all right well hey it was nice talking to you
yeah you too bye
okay so we are talking about recycling
i just move down from up near boston
yes and up there they're doing quite a bit
they one of the thing that they've tried doing is they've had it they got a deposit on all plastic containers you know bottles what not
i mean like coke bottles things like that and also cans so it's a five cent deposit on all of those which you know encourages somewhat for people to bring them back
there also in areas up their that mandated separating your garbage
from the paper i believe even right
so i know that they're doing and up there and several community down here they're not doing a hole lot down here their actually are some community where they mandating that most i think it's aluminum from everything else
and also it's against the law anywhere in the county down here to deposit yard trash like you know clippings and stuff in the trash
so that's what they're doing here what are they doing there
but it
but it still voluntary
what of the other things that there was been done up in massachusetts
that was very good were several of the grocery store chains were instituting a five cent credit if you brought back your bags and reuse them
sure
you haven't seen any i haven't seen any of that down here
sure
right my parents live in little rock arkansas
yes well they do and they and i sent my mom a couple of those canvas bags just so she can do that because they you know they look at her like she was crazy there
sure
unfortunately i think that what we are seeing though is like areas like plano i where it's not as densely populating you know the whole area
right
no actually not i was i was born in alabama and i lived in oklahoma where we didn't do any recycling i lived in arkansas massachusetts now florida
so massachusetts is probably like i said the best of what i seen there
sure
you know for the asphalt so they're gonna you know trash out
so why don't oklahoma city thought of that
sure
sure
i believe in baltimore they're recycling glass and using it as part of the asphalt
yes which they also think it is good because it makes the roads prettier
because they sparkle
my sister is born in baltimore
born in baltimore
i don't know
okay bill right
okay bill have you done much camping
ah ha
oh well that sounds good
yes you do now do you have a lot of mountain well you don't have mountains in texas do you where do you find places to camp
oh
uh-huh
oh
oh my word well that sounds adventuresome
we have five children and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so we've tried to get out once a year and go
on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains
and then the boys are our boys are old enough now they're twelve and eleven and so they're involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts
and last year my one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week and
so this year they'll both be going and so that's been real enjoyable for them
so
yes they've well
no actually they've i remember they have taken the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire
and i don't think they've taken the stoves last year they camped in tents
and this year i believe it will be in tents also
uh-huh yeah
oh is that right
oh and what does that consist of
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that
oh
my word
jeez
uh-huh
oh
oh
oh they're covered with like a heavy armor
type stuff uh-huh
my word
uh-huh
oh but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my word
we want to go
yes
okay
no i haven't is that good
it's not my favorite but i like it okay
uh-huh
that's okay
uh-huh
oh that sounds really good
yeah
well are there just the two of you
okay well when my husband and i go out we have four children so that makes a difference for us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best
but we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and feed the whole family like that
right
right but when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere and we usually head on down oh what's the freeway down here
yeah and there are all along that freeway there are restaurants but one of our favorites is pappasito's
no we love to go there yeah
you know it always kills me because i don't like the decorations so much it's too
yeah but i love the food i love the food they just are great
yeah um-hum
yeah uh-huh i like to get a shrimp it's a shrimp dish and i don't remember the name of it but it's rolled up into something and oh it's really good that's good
yeah they really good
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah it's very expensive
yeah that's true
sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a
no sometimes mark and i that's my husband mark go to the august moon which is down there it's a chinese restaurant with the lions in the front
yeah and it's pretty good as far as chinese food goes but chinese isn't my favorite so
but he likes it kind of so he says that's a good place now me i'm like i said seafood i'm i like that
ooh
uh-huh
uh-huh
is it oh how nice
yeah
i don't know that's
was it
yeah now they're real good yeah they're good
oh
is to die for i bet ooh
well my two littlest i just had a baby and she's six months and then my four year old he still but my other older two they can so they're
oh i'm telling you
well it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different things and so there's a fifteenth avenue down here
and along that street are all these fast food restaurants so we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing and then we go to a park over there so we can all have our own that's on the nights we can't decide
well i love them they're good kids
so
oh how nice
it'll be neat
yeah
yeah
you have to be careful if you go to a restaurant that really is more adult you know with the atmosphere and everything they if you're like we could probably take our oldest son and our oldest daughter
and they know how to act i don't i don't think i'd chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing and
yeah
so
yeah
yeah
oh
is it tia's not tia's
yeah i know which one it is and i can't think of it
yeah
oh dear
oh dear oh
oh
yeah
well i i've about said what my favorites were and i can't really think of any other
places
yeah you have to watch it if you go out to eat that's true
well good luck
yeah maybe okay bye-bye
okay what do you consider as camping
um-hum
um-hum
hm
um-hum well the only camping the only camping i've done really is living in a tent we used to go to lake shasta like fifteen years in a row
and you know take everything up there park our car unload the car and then go by boat to the camp spot you know two or three trips back to the car to unload everything
and the
no it was just a little camp spot that we found our you know by ourselves and it was usually in a little place called calucci creek
and you know we put up our eating tent our john tent and our sleeping tent
and slept in the tent you know on
well
you know what it is it's actually one of those little tents that you take to the beach and you set up to change your clothes in that's what we use to put around our john
it was like two weeks
it was
well just it was it was nice for a while but after fifteen years i got tired of it
right
but
i've never gone anyplace else really except lake shasta camping you know
no patterson's down by modesto
it's like twenty minutes away i used to live in oakland
and
used to go camping all the time up there but i've lived down here in patterson now since eighty eight
you know
um-hum
um-hum do you have little kids that like to
oh uh-huh
um-hum
it's fun for kids though isn't it
you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum well i'm ready to go camping again i did go camping in a in a camper on a pickup deer hunting
over a weekend so know lived in a camper on that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum but
um-hum
yeah
it would be fun to go camping up there again i haven't been up to yosemite for god i don't know how many years i would love to go up there again
um-hum
yeah i know if they say the road up there is terrible now you know with all the traffic
it was a long time ago that i went there but i've only been there once
you know
um-hum
yeah but it's beautiful though you look outside in the dark and you see all the all the stars up there and everything compared to you know living in the
do you exercise a lot
oh my
i think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not
well you're you are so far ahead of me i used to
i used to walk two miles a day and i really enjoyed it
because the two miles went fairly quickly i could do it in twenty eight minutes
and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way but it's a lot you know it's not too strenuous
and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but i don't know what i did to my knee i
was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer
and i mashed it wrong or i did something
and the doctor has had me on medication and she doesn't want me to walk she said that's you know while it's healing you're going to mess it up so i can't walk
and she said you know the most conservative approach you do the medicine you do the medicine again and again
before you think of surgery and i don't want her to think of surgery on my knee i don't want anyone to think about that
ever
that's that microscopic stuff you know uh-huh not my kneecap
but i miss it i really do and i
oh really
uh-huh
i can you understand that
i don't really want to i just know i need to
it's not anything i would want to but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk
i have got to be so much more careful with what i do
it's depressing
right boy
hopefully my knee is a hundred percent better maybe i can get back into it
i have ask you a question off the subject though you're in you're living in the castle park area
i grew up in oak cliff
yes just
close to methodist hospital
on candy c a n d y
oh
in fact i lived there
oh until nineteen
late nineteen fifties
and that area is it changing back again so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them
oh i know exactly where that is
yeah sure
oh that's
that's wonderful that is a gorgeous place
well sure they are
good great
oh wow
i need to go over there and just drive around and look it's
oh i'm sure it must be
i'm just we had a lovely little house over there it was like a two story
well story and a half really because we had a basement
and the guy that built it was weird
and i just loved the neighborhood and i mean everyone had houses like that they were all completely different
and so neat
now why couldn't your wife run around the golf course is that not good
oh was he
oh
yes i really hear that you know i think you know you're in oak cliff
but i'm in plano in west plano
and we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block we all know each other and the street doesn't go anywhere
if you are on the street you better belong there
because it's not a through street
had a lot of heartburn with that
i mean
it looked darker to him because he was in the house with the lights on
when i was out walking it was more of a pre dawn type pretty
but huh-uh he didn't think it looked pre dawn to him it looked dark and even he was real concerned about that so
it's not just because you are in oak cliff it's just because you're smart that you don't do things like that
that's right
there's only one crazy out there you know to make any difference
where do you get most of your current events
uh-huh
yeah i was i was we don't have cable so we were watching c n a lot and then trying to switch thank goodness for remote control
we were switching from one station to another and in between keeping the radio on
it was extraordinary yeah we and then you know couldn't wait for the newspaper reminded me of when i was younger the time of watergate and just couldn't get enough of it
but
huh
yeah you just couldn't you couldn't put it you couldn't put it down
and but occasionally you know you'd stay in tune just long enough to get the latest different tidbit or a different angle and you really became addicted to it for a while
and at that point i at least try to get through most the front section and maybe you know one or two other sections
uh-huh
how does it how does compare have you can you like how does it compare to the post
yeah that's funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something and we pick up a local paper we're really shocked even in a major city at how local it is it's really provincial
is it really i mean
that's maybe because we get so you know we're so jaded with the post
which is really international and it keeps reminding me you know that this we're really in an in an different situation here and i keep saying no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in the country vote the way they do i mean
but i probably do watch more t v because i get home and in between say cooking dinner or something if i can catch a five or six o'clock news
i watch that usually before we settle down depending what time we get to bed we'll usually watch the ten or the eleven o'clock news we have a ten o'clock news here at night and that's ideal
because by ten thirty i start to fade
so
what are you studying
like yeah i remember when i was in school
yeah
yeah no i can remember way back in those days when i was in school the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was during the cuban missile crisis
i we could just we were all centered around that television yep
that's exactly right and i'd
yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson
to the to the younger people you know than there is the other generation
oh that's true yeah
yeah
that was probably the best part of the news was the some of the person human interest stories
uh-huh
yeah
does it does it bother you that at this point in your life that you're not getting more direct news or
what are you studying
okay yeah i guess
yeah how old are you
okay then i'm see i'm about twenty years older
and i really do i do rely i do miss it i do rely on the news and i guess i regret i don't get enough really local we get some local papers but i guess i'm more interested in the national or international
news overload
yeah
but
well it's i'll tell you though it is hard when you go to vote i mean there are so many issues and there're so many people running that you know unless you have some way of evaluating it
and i guess the news does help well it was really nice talking to you okay
i hope so
take care bye-bye
yeah i've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television
you were he was waiting for what again
that's what this was yeah well let me go a head and push one okay
murphy brown designing women that ilk
yeah what do you like
oh okay
that's okay we've been married eleven years and we went through that after about five years of marriage my old tv that i had from college when we got married finally went out and we went we made it for about almost eighteen months without a television
yeah but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize
yeah now oh yeah and then you never use the vcr and now we have two of them and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it
well i don't know tv shows what can i tell you basically junk that's on television
that's my opinion yeah
i like things like i just mentioned have you ever seen murphy brown or anything like that
you don't think so that's the one with candice bergen in it
yeah that would do it
right nobody does yeah then uh-huh i know
and to this day twenty years later i'm like i'm in my thirties i'm not that old but i'm going jeez i can't believe that thing's still on television
yeah they you know about the only other kinds of things i like i like to watch a lot of news don't you miss that with not having a television so far
how long has it been since you've had one
oh my god yeah you've got about another six months and then you'll get one
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i like the cosby la law is probably i've seen cheers more then that i hate to admit but
cheers yeah i thought it was good i've actually been to that bar in boston it's a you know it's a pretty funny show yeah it's kind of a
it's just a you know over priced
downtown boston yuppie you know tourist attraction
i'm trying to think what else is on i know it's like
yeah who didn't isn't that sad
um-hum
no i like the pro i like actually i like pro basketball as opposed to i'll watch pro football but i like the nba play-offs
back when like the pistons were in them and now and where are you calling from or where
sherman oh i'm in dallas i was just saying where am i calling you from yeah well then i don't know if you like the mavericks or not or
yeah i'm talking to you from dallas uh-huh
my voice you mean oh no that's just because i've moved around and
i'm originally from pennsylvania so
actually i'm a big chicago bears fan real big and i always watch them so what no matter who's on of course you like them too right do you
oh okay
and i'm trying to think what else i watch on television sportswise i like i like tennis so i mean i'm not i haven't played in years but i just like to watch you know two players really get go at it on television
gets boring after a while but i don't go ahead
oprah
uh-huh
yeah on the tracks yeah
maybe because she got chubby again or something
was she was her show big when you were in school since you haven't been out that long
was her show big when you were in college since you haven't been out that long was it
see i know isn't that terrible i know i guess with that money who cares
yeah let's see what all's on television oh if you don't have a vcr we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it yeah cause you know if you like movies like we do
you do it once in awhile and then you know you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it and then it usually comes on television within two years you know
yeah oh that's okay
i had one lady one time they called in i just signed up my husband had been on this project and i she called in and it was all about we don't have children and it's all about sending your kids to college and why you would advise them
so i know i mean it's like don't worry about it television at least you know everybody's at least seen during the war did you laugh when they had that man on what was his name wolf blitzer
that guy that was a reporter for cnn
his name is wolf blitzer did you see it him when he was doing the coverage of the gulf
no that was the other guy from cbs oh what was his name
i can't remember his name
they have but just of they made jokes about him like on the carson show and all that jay leno
huh
yeah he's funny
yeah saturday night live has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year
i mean i haven't seen it in a couple months but used to
yeah actually i think it has i mean they finally like dana carvey and some of those people they really have some funny characters on there
yeah they have one character on there they just call it pat and they you don't know if it's a man or a woman
and they say well they're trying to deduce what he what he or she is so to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse and pat says no i carry a fanny pack
so you still don't know because a fanny pack is man or nowadays you know
yeah it's it is pretty funny i mean they do some crazy things
you probably have some friends that have
you know i mean you're not totally out of the loop
i mean yeah
yeah i mean you really you can do without one but after awhile you'll start you know i mean you just kind of all of sudden cause you're going well gee that you hear about something that somebody else talked about
oh that's a good school yeah i know about that they don't have southern accents up there though
you must be native texan
well you're from indiana yeah you oh real southern yeah uh-huh
deep you have deep one yes
it is at purdue i'm trying to think i went to high school in chicago i'm trying to think what purdue kids watch
uh-huh
okay
do you know that i've never i think other then except like on a commercial or on news coverage or something like entertainment tonight i've never seen mtv
that's kind of what i've heard
i mean that's yeah
channel access to something i'm never going to i mean my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time and they've only been married five years have a cute one year old kid he i swear to god he works from eight
