well i think air pollution is a pretty big problem right now and it's i mean i think it's a real bad problem i don't think that a lot is really being done about it at this point
and there's just things like for a i think that cars especially here in the united states are just a major source of the pollution when you consider that most people have at least one automobile and people drive around all the time
and i think you know if you just totaled up i don't know any of the exact figures but all the millions of cars that are driving around spewing out carbon monoxide all the time i think you're going to end up with a pretty big number
and if you look at other countries like in the third world and stuff where people ride bikes and all that i'm sure that their
air quality is much better than ours just as a result of their lack of having cars like if you look at los angeles i mean they've they said that the major reason that it's so smoggy there is because they all sit and drive down the freeway everyday
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right and there was i just saw today that
president bush they were had new a new regulation out that was going to put a canister to collect some of the exhaust fumes on most new cars and he
is not going to let that regulation pass through because he says that well it's going to cost too much money and take too many jobs away from the people up in michigan
and i just think that's ridiculous that i mean if they've developed the technology to remove some of the harmful pollutants that come out of people's exhaust pipe and not implementing it is just seems kind of ludicrous to me
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
right exactly the another thing i don't know here in the midwest in indiana at least we produce most of our energy burning coal
and if you just look at some of these there's a coal burning electricity plant here in town and you can just sit there and watch the smoke stacks and the amount of pollution that just pours out of there
i use to live right next to this plant and every single day you would go out and your car would just have you know it's not like three inches of dust or anything but you can see the dust that had come out of this smoke stack and just fallen right down on your car
and you know they say that the coal we burn here in indiana is responsible for a large part of the acid rain that they have up in new york state and in canada and all that
and it's just you know it's ridiculous when we could be spending the money to develop the technology to you know clean up some of these
sources of pollution like the smoke stacks but then the big businesses say well we can't do it because it's going to cost us too much money and it's like well we kind of got to think a little bit more forward instead of
you know we're not going to make as much money this year because we're trying to clean things up i just it kind of
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
right
yeah all and all i think that we really i mean if you look at almost any industry it's producing so much pollution i mean they're spewing out just tons of this atmospheric garbage every single year
and something really ought to be done because it it's basically we don't see the problem right now and like you said the pollution that we're putting out now is not really going to affect anybody for twenty thirty years so i don't think it's got i mean the
okay
oh we use them
for paying our gas
for paying
but we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the credit cards
if there's a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free so we never have to pay anything extra
yeah we just don't think it's worth it
so
uh-huh
yeah
yes exactly that's how i mean it's a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse
yeah
yeah because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something
yeah and i think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our visa or our mastercard or whatever
and then you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later
and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later
oh yeah
yeah even if it's five bucks even
yeah
and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty four hours you can report it in
and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and if whoever tried to you know credit it to the hilt
you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then
you know you can have your card back with
pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever
i know
yeah exactly
yeah sure i mean it's just a precaution for everybody
yeah so
oh i also use like to use discover when i can because you know they give you some money back every year
yeah
well we just started doing that and
you know what it comes in handy is for when you're buying things like tickets for the train or airplanes
because they'll give you some money back you know and it's only a little bit but i mean it's still something we got two fifty last year
and so it's you know it helps out here and there
so
yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing but when you know when you add up everything you've charged up on the discover card for a year
and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something
and so that's what
and i know we're going to get back more this year because they
you know we spent a little bit more
probably and they do it for how long you've been a member i think too
and they increase the percentage a little bit
yeah
yeah
and all the a t m transactions and everything and i've got a file for each of them and
i have a file box and each file has a little piece of paper on it and each file there i have a file for each month of the year
and then i also have files for like credit card receipts and when the bills come in for the credit cards they go in the month that they have to be paid for
right
unless i get paid on time like for instance if a bill is due on march fourth i'll just i'll put it in the folder with march and that way when i get paid in march i know that whatever bill is in there have to be paid in that month
right and that
and that way i keep a running list of what bills i do have and that way i know if i have any extra money or not
when i don't what
so i'm at home most of the time anyways but
like once in a while like when my taxes came back i had extra money so i paid a babysitter to watch my kids for the day and i went to i went to goofing off and you know just something little like that but it's something that you really got to keep an eye on when you have kids
because you're always got to have money when you have kids
well i have a i have a running budget for every month
and on that budget i type up a budget for every month in the year and it has the bills that i know i have every month electric phone food the kid's pediatrician
my visa bill you know all the bills i know i have every month are on that budget
and so once all of those get paid i go through my file and see if there is anything else and if there's not then i know that the rest of the money is mine
oh yes
right
right
right or well that comes up every six months for me or like tags come up once a year and you've got to figure that in too
right whenever my tags come up there is an entry right there that says tags and then i just leave the space blank until i find out how much i owe for my tags and then i get them and that way i know i know that they have to be paid in that month so i'm expecting it
no usually i just pay it out of whatever paycheck is in that month because after i pay my regular bills i usually have approximately a hundred and fifty dollars and with that hundred and fifty dollars i pay things that come up like insurance
or tags or whatever happens to come up in that month
well i've got an annuity fund set up because i don't know just the way i was raised i look toward the future
not only for my kids but for myself and i've got an annuity for me and every two months i buy my boys each a savings bond
every since they have been born i've been doing that
so
an annuity is an account it's like a it's a type of savings account okay but you don't touch it you just deposit money into it but you don't touch it other than that and it just sits there and gains interest until your retirement
not right now
if
right
and like if elderly people they have a choice of having an ira account and they get special discounts on like the
what's the word i'm trying to think of the interest charges and stuff if they have an ira they get special rates on it and stuff
right
right for the elderly people and stuff that have iras set up and they get special discounts on that but an annuity is
it's a savings account that you don't withdraw anything out of you just keep depositing money into it
how you doing
i have three i didn't say i have three of them yeah two i have the girl is the oldest and then two boys
yeah well you're doing a lot better than i can i can't rattle them off like that i know my youngest is eighteen he's as i said in a senior in high school but i have a
my oldest son he's out seeing the world right now he's in australia at the present time
ouch
yeah
yeah
right
i'll bet that story's all too common i
yeah
i don't think i would have to say i probably didn't get to spend as much time as i would have liked to either however i did you know
early on i was in the retail business and i worked late hours so i saw less of them then but then when i changed over and got into electronics industry i
i did have more time and i tried to spend some more time with them
and you know we did things as a family we went camping quite a bit and we you know took trips went to see my folks in florida and
and some of those kind of things
uh-huh
that may be the difference in our part of the country we live in it's a lot easier to get out outside all year round well pretty near all year round out here
yeah
i guess
i can think of a
things i would like to have done differently on the kids though
um-hum
uh-huh
oh yeah
petting zoos and things
um-hum
our kids played
ball it wasn't it was like you know little league and it was dads oaks dads club which was a like a little league
yeah we used to go to the games and we had
and pick them up and carry them there and that kind of thing
i personally don't believe i did no for one reason being like i mentioned i was in retail when she was younger
and then
you know she being a girl i guess she probably spent a lot of time with her mother more so than with me
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah
that's probably the same
case in our family too
yeah a lot of cases daughters getting get real close to their dads too you know and
yeah
yeah
is your daughter the oldest
you have you ever heard much about that theory about the you know how their different their position in the family relates to their you know some of their
mannerisms and personality yeah
yeah i believe it's true it's my experiences what i know about it and then observing it with my kids at least and then like some other people's children too it's
you know it's you know the older kid is more always more prone to be more like responsible and that kind of thing
yeah and
in our case he he's real sensitive and real thoughtful and
yes
i don't know if
yeah right that's
that's matthew he's it's boy he was always he just
he'd keep it to himself a lot of times but he'd really kind of well up
huh
yeah
yeah that was i'm sure it was a powerful experience for him it's something he'll remember
oh okay
right
yep
uh-huh
right
yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time it's not clear in that
yeah
uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
so
right
yeah
right
yeah
well i do research in computer science and i've just been doing that for a few years now so
i my job has most of the benefits i want
what i really like is i like being like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as i'd like but
you know that's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of
they also a really important thing to me is when they
they pay for continuing education like i get night courses that they're they'll cover right now and that's really good
yeah
right
yeah
right
okay
i don't really i more
the people i wouldn't consider to be a threat at all
and i really don't feel much like the soviet union itself is a threat anymore i'm worried about them they're in a very
tumultuous state right now with the kinds of adaptations that they're attempting to go through
so
yeah i think that's a real important aspect and that as the most the
let's see
the more that we that we do or that we can do to help them become self sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk
this last winter was very hard on several areas in the in the ukraine particularly the coal mining regions
of siberia the people there have money that's not their problem but there's no food for them to buy and its you can't eat money
yeah
right they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through
now and
they don't understand that to make that work they've got to take some responsibility for themselves it's not just the government's responsibility anymore
you can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well
okay all right bye-bye
oh really hum
oh my gosh
uh-huh
do they do they traditionally have a good team or is this sort of an unusually thing
huh
huh
huh yeah see we're it's they're actually in the university of texas system and i don't i don't even know anything about them i'm here in austin we have ut austin
the longhorns
and
actually i don't know right now longhorns aren't having quite the year that they had hoped they had a star forward that was disqualified because of
of something i guess as he was leaving his junior college they some supporter gave him a car or something and
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
no it something had happened outside of that you know and it happened as part of his junior college career
and then actually ut on his behalf filed a an injunction in the court system to allow him to continue to play which worked for a few games and then they then they pulled him in so
they've been having i mean last year they had a real good team they had they had a new coach tom penders come in about i guess about three years ago
and the program had been in a long a long decline you know for years they i guess back when abe lemons was here they built quite a quite a tradition
and then it kind of went downhill for about for a couple of coaches and penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
hum
i don't know yeah the women's program is quite interesting down here the women's program here in austin
actually for a while it was drawing bigger crowds than the men's program if you could imagine that they but they you know they just have traditionally been a dominant a dominant basketball team i mean they've always been in the top
top eight in the country and actually had a couple of years that they haven't been quite as strong but
the southwestern conference they've been undefeated in the they were no they aren't now but they had been undefeated in the southwestern conference for something like a five year streak or something
and had won the conference title for ten years in a row or
and so -at is they've that's quite a tradition here in texas but
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
right
up to speed yeah
oh my goodness well we're sort of sort of a general motors family i guess that's the way we were raised
and we were overseas for ti for a number of years and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family
for you know they each had twenty one thousand miles or something like that and turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that
then we've got an eighty six chevy spectrum that we bought new my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her
and we've got a eighty four toyota that we bought used so we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers it's like musical chairs
and we got older and got away and then we thought well you know you still could buy general motors products and it was probably not that bad but we lived in malaysia for ti in nineteen eighty one two three and four
and we bought a we lived in the philippines for ti in eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and we bought a ford telstar which is somewhat similar to the taurus it's sold in the in the far eastern far east countries more
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
oh yeah the big yeah
um-hum
sure
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah
yeah it seems that something goes every month
and i'm afraid we're gonna be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty sixes and an eighty four and we'll probably be there with all of them you know it's the same thing you know i don't know whether you classify the skylark and the calais as small i guess they're intermediates
but we went on a family trip to massachusetts and there were five of us and five of us never go anywhere together here
it was just nice it floated
oh yeah
yeah
yeah and
and you know i've read i'm in the quality business at ti i'm a quality manager and we're we deal we sell i'm in the semiconductor group and we sell to ford chrysler and gm delco
and i and you know we used to think ford products were tinny i mean i was growing up
i was taught that when i was growing up you know that real people bought general motors products and you know and peons bought ford products but just with the quality requirements
that ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants and they're really
stressing this partnerships in quality and you know gm and chrysler are doing that but i really think ford's got a -ship position in this right now and i think it's showing up in their automobiles their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now
and we went to austin a while back to a basketball tournament and we were gonna be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down we'd rent
one and we went up to the local budget and we were gonna get a olds eighty eight or something he said i'll tell you what for a dollar a day more i'll give you a lincoln towncar
and we drove that down and i hated to turn that back in when we got back we had that for three days and i absolutely except i wouldn't wanna have to park it in tight places all the time
both coming and going so i knew what i actually got on the trip and it was about twenty four miles a gallon
and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it let it float
and it was pretty nice are you are you planning on getting any additional or other cars
um-hum
oh yeah you probably got another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them
we've got probably we'll get something in the next couple years my son will graduate from high school this year and he's gonna go to richland college one year behind us
and i want a pickup i may get one and not let him have it but we have been looking at these red they they're very popular around here
these red chevy pickups and we'll probably do something like that incidentally
and or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal
and my boss just bought a chevy pickup and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way
yeah and you know you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and tell him what you want and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer's place
so i'm gonna try that the next time i buy one
yeah
yeah
and for that price
we'll go somewhere else yeah
yeah and i think that's probably the way you got to do it when i was young
i went in and bought a or made a deal on a sixty this is nineteen sixty i'd first come to texas and made a deal on a sixty red impala convertible
i got back and a salesman that lived in the apartment i did asked me if he'd heard i was gonna get a car and asked me what i paid for it he said well hey before you go buying anything he says call this friend of mine at will's point
and he says oh somebody's taking he said what did you get a deal for bill and i told him he says somebody's taking you for a ride and i said no somebody took me for a ride
last saturday and i find that and for the longest time then i drove up to will's point and the and the and the fellow died since then and some of his relatives taken over the business but and since then i hadn't
yeah i have the problem with the telemarketers over here we get we get all types we get the handicapped people calling up here
and if you don't want the light bulbs there's vitamins and if you don't want the vitamins there's the household cleaner
yeah they were bugging me for a donation earlier and i you know i get these calls on one line just constantly every single organization
and you know you it's i've learned to hang up on them but sometimes it's not so easy
yeah
the other thing that i think is amusing are with these long distance companies now we have mci here
and they have their friends and family program and i love it you can call up on one of the lines the
well there's another one the account balance line all you got to know is the person's zip code
and you can find out how they're paying their m c i bills and on anyone you know all you got to do is cross reference a phone number with a zip code
which isn't too difficult and you can learn all sorts of things and sprint does the same thing
yeah
huh
yeah we had we got a report back in the mail as a matter of fact and found all sorts of problems with it mainly account numbers that have changed and they left both accounts showing as open
and some other one that claimed i didn't pay them and i did and then you have to try and get that company to take you off and they don't really want to bother and
oh yeah it's a pain in the neck because they you know they'll believe these companies in a second over the individual
and getting proof for these people i mean it's not my job you're the one that screwed up and you know if you want to damage my credit rating that's fine but i will take whatever actions are appropriate to protect it
oh yeah i know i've been reading the comp dcom telecom all about it
yeah i contribute every once in a while in there and yeah i see the messages about the a n i
yeah i you know the other boondoggle is this caller i d thing you know i don't mind caller i d one bit
if i don't want to use it or if someone calls me that i don't know who it is i can just not answer the phone
lee
oh well i think ideally people should want to do that automatically and that they should want to do what
you know meshes with how they feel and what they're good at and they shouldn't be funneled into a mandatory sort of a thing
oh well in that case i think what this country needs is a good mandatory program to
you know get people just thinking hey this is normal it's normal to do good you know to be civic minded you know just so they won't you know everybody will just think
this is the way things are and it
well i'm not looking at the mandatory program as a cost effective way of getting this stuff done i'm looking at it as a way to shape people's psyches into thinking that public service is a good thing
of course the program would have to work or else they'll think yeah public service another boondoggle you know they'll be sitting there working on the job doing nothing
oh well certainly the people that do volunteer to do all sorts of things aren't thinking cost effective
well i think everything that people you know what do people do they polish their cars right why do they do it because
they think they're going to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that much longer no because they want it to look really sharp
not a cost effective thing you know they raise money to build a new church because they want to put eight zillion filigrees there because it's cost effective or because they need the space
you have to define the purpose of the program you know is there excess labor and that's why you're doing this
i mean what there's sort of both excess bodies available to labor but then there's not enough skilled labor
so at the same time you have too many people who want to or too many people who could work and not enough people who can work
well they did this in the depression they invented what the ccc
and they had a whole bunch of people go out west and dig ditches and plant trees and
yes
yes i am
well i'm happy we got through
well i'm especially interested with what what's happening in the soviet union the move to
is quite a remarkable
accomplishment is that is that reported in the texas papers
if i was looking at a us map i would say it was sort of reminds me of a
-ell it's not as big as california proportionately
yeah
they're completely out now
yeah the three the three baltic republics got out as quickly as they could
yes
yes
that that's true
hasn't happened here for a while but it
um-hum
no i've heard they're i hear you have some problems
do you do you do you blame the government in washington for this
yes
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
so i mean you think it's you think it's reagan and bush have done this or is it just coincidence it was during this period
um-hum
oh the chinese use slave labor too that's one of the ways they get away with it
yeah
i don't think there's any one simple answer to the whole thing i mean it's that's very complicated
so which one are we gonna throw out
uh-huh
texas used to be a democratic state didn't it
i like your governor
she's an impressive woman
yeah
well yeah anybody could beat claytie in
oh i know some of the people
okay do you have you ever had to put your children in child care mary dell
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh i see
oh well i have a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of them has ever been in day care for the reason of me working but they both went through preschool
right like half day programs uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh my gosh
uh-huh
oh my goodness
right yeah
uh-huh yeah that is a big drawback i think in that in the public schools out here
oh is that right i had no idea
oh my goodness
and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to
not going to change anytime soon
oh my goodness
yeah that's true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten
yeah get the computers out and you know well that's hard it's so difficult for them
did you have your children did you say in home in private care was that in your home or in someone else's home
uh-huh so you were able to have somebody come there
yeah did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you
oh
oh my goodness
uh-huh
yeah
oh
oh gosh
uh-huh i have a
uh-huh i was just listening to a program this morning oh well i guess it was on the home show but they were talking about
and they've now moved it to washington dc and the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there
you know so
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh boy that's great
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah
uh-huh
gosh it's amazing
right
uh-huh
well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly
you know the people that work in big business have families they have children so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
oh that's good
that's good to know i got a couple of friends that have found the
you know a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age and they
usually you know you'll find a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home and my future sister-in-law's mother does that too full-time
uh-huh
oh too transit uh-huh
and her surroundings too yeah
primarily with our local newspaper and tv
i listen to the radio but not
oh i see well that's that is one of the handicaps with both tv and
and radio if you're not available on the hour or half hour then you lose out on an awful lot well what is your newspaper
that is the washington post is that correct i have read that when we were in that area and it it's a splendid newspaper
so what more do we need to discuss tonight that seems like a very short one
well i can discuss a lot of the news that we have but i feel that that's not part of our responsibility
so thank you for calling
all right good night
well lets see i suppose i could say i joy crocheting
gardening knitting
hiking
well it seems like i don't have time for them but i'm i don't work full-time or anything
i sell avon and stanley products
but it's that's not
uh-huh
oh
you sound young
uh-huh
oh good
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah that could be a little boring sometimes i guess too but
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
how old is your little
boy
oh is it really
oh how old
oh that's nice
just one of them
um-hum

um-hum
yeah
we had for a while done well we still do a lot of picture taking in that and we're in the process of putting our eight millimeter
films and now the kids and i were going to put them on video
and we're in the process of doing that right now and
yeah
we bought the equipment
that you do it with
well the you buy this little piece of equipment and you use your video camera of course and your projector
and the combination you the way you know connect them up
i think it's going to we were a little worried there was a lot of background noise on it but
we can hook it into our stereo system after we get the pictures all done
we can hook it into our a or stereo system and put music
to the film and that will cut out all the background the noise of the recorder running and that
because the projector made a lot makes a lot of noise
yeah
the kids grow up and
yeah
we mainly just did a bit of black and white it's
uh-huh
oh you can really get some good really good pictures in black and white
that
um-hum
um-hum
it's hard to even find film or anything
yeah
but
uh-huh
did she
oh that's great
yeah
yeah i don't do a whole it time seems to be hard to find for anything you want to do i don't know why
you
you'd think i'd have a lot time but
i don't know
they don't really care what they have
but i do enjoy it i enjoy painting some too but i
i really have trouble finding time i did some toll painting for a while and i started doing a still life and it's it never got finished
well had have you watched any of these things on tv these large brush
um-hum
well once you start it apparently it's not bad some of the girls have gone into the call age group claritin university is just not too far from here
they've gone in and done a class on the large brush and actually did the painting
and you know they've never done anything
yeah i like to cook
yeah i don't do a lot of fancy cooking
well it depends on what it is you know well now we i we have a small garden and i can i do canning
and
yeah
that's too bad was it lower back or
um-hum
yeah that's one thing that our gardening we're getting it my husband he's retired but he's having
trouble now and he's not allowed to mow the grass we have a lot of grass takes me about four hours to do our lawn
and things like that so it makes it a little bit
difficult but i do love to garden my kids loved it because i never allowed anybody in my garden that didn't like to do it
yeah mostly vegetables i had grew some flowers but mostly vegetables
yeah
yes well i hope you have a nice birthday today for your son
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
okay you too and thanks a lot
bye-bye
okay what exactly we're talking about industries trends everything
okay
all right we'll start twenty years back and come forward how's that sound
all right
well yeah i think they have i really do and it's no longer the issue it once was and i'm kind of glad least i hope that's a good sign that
the times have changed to the more equitable at least
yeah i think they have too i don't think women's rights have come as far
i think that in general women would feel like they still sort of getting the bum deal
compared to say some of the minority groups
if i recall back in the sixties we didn't tend to run a debt all the time but we did run a debt a lot with the great society a lot seventies and so forth
and then it looked like we just stayed in some sort of a economic morass ever since
hello we're there
right i can
yeah i can remember in the late sixties early seventies you couldn't even hardly find a japanese car around
and what few there were around were very ugly looking things must've been
yeah they must've been pretty reliable though because some of them they built up a fairly good following and it appears that's the case do you own any kind of foreign car
i don't either i've always just i don't know whether you call it buy american it's just that i've always bought fords and i guess i'll just keep buying fords
but
well
some of the ethical aspects of political life certainly seem to have gone downhill and certain
yeah in certain respects i feel like that the
reagan administration coming right off the carter administration did tend to bring back a more aggressive
aspect to the human rights issues and the sort of things that democracy in this country has really stood for and you know and brought it back to the limelight compared to the sixties and seventies
and i think that was a positive thing but it seems like
with all that we never seem to be able to get our house in order when it comes to the economic things i bring this back to that at least it seems like we still continue to run
heavy indebted budgets and the like i don't see any real way out of it either i might add
yeah well
yeah i think that's true
yeah i think they have too seems like that the country's been more migratory
and the old family structure of the mothers and the grandmothers and the grandfathers maybe even some great grandparents occasionally that seems to have been broken apart pretty well including the family structure as a unit itself
yeah well i hope that's not right i do i do hear these statistics same as you do and i always felt like at least the immediate family unit mother father and children
was a cohesive structure that was healthy and was a integral part of what made this country
i don't know sort of a stable country in terms of discipline i don't know some not necessary discipline but social order that's it and i
yeah
yeah in my family i know most of us are southerners just happen to be living up in maryland though but my family we're
we sort of like our roots and like to get back and have family reunions and all that
and i think that may not be the norm for a lot of people as much as it is for us that don't want to do that
yeah
yeah
i must say too it seems like the whole flavor of war has changed considerably when you look at back at the vietnam era
and what all we went through there in terms of what's happened in the iraqi situation it seems like we have made a rather
major about face in terms of the way we conduct war and the way we can technologically carry out a war
well then too i think the philosophy is changed i was just reading tonight in the one of the news magazines that you can take you know i take newsweek time and us news and world report all three as a matter of fact
and i was just reading in one of the those news magazines that there's a
a movement among certain members of the military establishment the upper hierarchy officer staff
to change the kind of way we conducted war in the past in terms of instead of meeting the enemy sort of head on instead of doing more feinting and technologically appropriate tactics like these smart bombs and things like that doing more
more smart things that are very damaging getting in getting out making end runs allowing more creativity at the lower echelon levels for people to slip in slip out and do things
than has been the case in the past where the idea was to meet your enemy sort of head on and the like and i think politically we've changed a lot i think in the vietnam war
we congress got too much involved in trying to manage the war
yeah and that that's absolutely the wrong way to go to conduct a war in my opinion when you when you're in a war right or wrong you should let the military establishment handle it and give them the job that they're paid and supposedly skilled at doing
and let them get on with it instead of tying their hands which i felt like was not the case in the vietnam war but was entirely the opposite in the case of the iraqi war
where they more or less gave it to schwartzkopf and the rest of the military units and just says hey look handle it and they did
and i think the military proved itself competent to do exactly what it's paid to do and it just goes to give me a feeling that we did some things wrong
i think in the vietnam era and that congress should have stayed out of it much as possible
but that i see as a change and then industrially going back i think industrially we've changed i think we've come through an era of the last thirty years or so twenty ten of a
a nation that was industrially oriented towards manufacturing type industries and i think now we seeing ourselves transitioning into a more technological electronics age where it's
information and communication and computers that is really our next industrial revolution
and you know it wouldn't surprise me the least little bit if we didn't see the whole idea of manufacture of automobiles and the like except to some degree we have to keep a little bit of expertise in the house that being a base export to third world countries and you may might find even japan and
and major powers like the british and the central european economies being less and less dependent upon that kind of industry
because it's somewhat labor intensive even if they start robotizing it i i'm concerned that would be the case instead the more
advanced nations would tend to get more computerized more telecommunication oriented and the like and information is getting to be sort of the thing
um-hum yeah i think i think we're made some mistakes too for i think the education system in this country has not really kept abreast of what's going on industrially
and i'll give you an example i was talking about i've said for years because i my background's in physics and i've said for years that the education system in this country has not reacted
to what is the actual industrial evolutionary state of the country and by that i mean when i was going to school you got your basic sciences
and that was pretty much about it
and when i got out of school i had to sort of teach myself everything i've learned about computers and programming and just you know the whole bit hardware in general relative to why you can do things with data acquisition process and the like
and when i was going to school you had to have mathematics if you were in engineering or science or any of the other scientific fields chemistry and biology and the like
but you never had to have computers and even to this date in colleges it's not required to take computer courses if you're in the engineering or the science fields
unless you're a computer scientist or someone in that area and then it is required of course because it's part of the curriculum and just as we have to take at least a year of english in colleges and a year of some sort of social study
i think that it should be required in college in a in a science curriculum i even think in liberal arts this day and time it should be required you have to have a year of some sort of
no i think that maybe the automation people that are
we're discrete well are not discrete electronic devices
oh and did he is he the one that got you connected with us
hum okay it's a lot of fun
you want to punch the button and go
yep
well are you going to buy a car soon
and what are you going to buy
well have you been listening to iaccoca's arguments that chrysler products are the only ones that all have airbags
does that make a difference to you
yeah like what
yeah
that's nice
did
did you see the i don't know if it was 20/20 last thursday or friday night on seat belts
did that scare you a little bit with the lady being thrown out
and run over
that really i guess i that a little more than scared me that irritated me that because it
if it surely didn't come as a surprise that
that if the door came open the lady would fall out i mean and
for me it's a real it's a real consideration
and the but no i probably wouldn't have even though i'm really quite into cars it's probably my main hobby
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah you know road and track had a had some articles on and particularly with backseat with some where kids were sitting in the backseat with seat belts on and they were thrown forward
into the front seat and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to i mean to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the forced to go so really if your sitting in the backseat
you're better off not to have your seatbelt on if it's just a seatbelt we have a van that just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness
i have an arrow star van we really do it's a mini van we've had it goodness in may will be five years and they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty
and the transmission was replaced but they really are nifty
the mini van it's actually we had a station wagon before and it's a foot or two shorter than a we had a regular size station wagon
and it really
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well but the did you did you go to florida in a van
yeah
yeah
which what kind was it
what was remarkable this van even with the we have two kids and we went to disney world
actually i grew up in alabama and i went to see my mother and then went on down to disney world and it got better than i think twenty two twenty three miles a gallon and this was with the air conditioner on and you know
four people with luggage and course this grant it that's you know it's been four years ago but it's remarkable that the that the bigger vans they're
my boss just bought a pick up truck and he only gets seventeen miles a gallon
but it has a big engine and it pulls a boat and stuff but it's and it it's got the seats that and the other thing that is interesting is it has rear air conditioning
and that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates
well the big you know the big vans are all real nice
yeah
oh those are
yeah
yeah
all right
they
well
well the mini the you'd be surprised if you drive a one of the mini vans fact there all more or less alike the chevrolet and well of course oldsmobile has got one and chryslers got one but they drive remarkably like cars
yeah
yeah but the little thing etched in it say objects are closer than they appear or something
yeah
well you can you can install those mirrors we've got the big side mirrors which are really nice i don't know if you've well if you've driven a pick up truck you know these are these mirrors are must be six inches across not nearly a foot high
and they really nice i'm on both sides actually they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back
but there
uh-huh
um-hum
well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features you can get pretty decent gas mileage
oh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah interesting enough ford announced that i think in ninety two they're going to put air bags in their in their vans
surprisingly they're you really need to do you need a combination of both the air bags and the
and your seatbelt so
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it would be interesting to see what that'd do to our insurance rates
you know if the insurance companies says it says we're not going to pay you know a claim if the car doesn't have air bags
would be interesting wouldn't it that wouldn't be fair but
yeah
yeah
i've got to go my son's in a performance tonight i have to leave in a couple of minutes i think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time
it was good talking to you okay good night
my goodness that's unusual
mine well mine are grown and of course i've already been through this with them
and i guess i'll have to help with grandchildren one of these days i hope
and one of them ended up at el centro in one of the specialized programs and another one is putting herself through right now back at utd
how far is it from home i had to put in and then course we also had to include how much is it gonna cost
yeah
that's true that's true
um-hum
um-hum
well you have to be practical because i know our first daughter went to stephen f austin
and her allergies acted up in the piney woods and it was too far from home and she got lonesome and that didn't work out for her so i guess i learned on that one
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh
well we'll have to give them the pass key i guess do you have more than the one daughter to plan for
okay
um-hum well
that's good do you find that the boy is going in a different direction than the girl as far as what his needs are and the type of college he wants
well yeah
good
um-hum
um-hum
okay i'll vote for her if she has good track record hope i'm around to do so
good
yes we do right here at the at the very building they have a nurse's office
and i haven't
my name hasn't come up yet how about you
right
right
i have a similar opinion at first i
wasn't sure
but
then
i thought it was a good thing for the company as well
saying that it's a violation of my rights and this and that and the tests aren't accurate and
but i think they've got that testing down to a real science where you know they don't you know
i'm sure you saw the video on how they do the testing and it it's almost impossible i think to
to make a mistake
right
right
who were
and
oh taking drug testing
oh sure i think that's
i feel that you know for certain cases that i that i am willing to give up my rights
to secure the rights of others i guess is what i'm saying
when the public whole ah is at stake
then i'm willing to you know personally i can't speak for others but for myself i'm willing to say okay you know
if i see this is a right to if to privacy i'm willing to give up that right
because i can see that it's
public good is at stake and the company good is at stake and
you know if they can get this thing under control you know it it's going to save us all money
as far as benefits and everything else you know insurance and everything else in this country
right
right you don't work in an area where there's chemicals or machinery or things like that but
and they don't have any of that up here but you know
i guess it's just the productivity
and the number of sick days i guess
and that they
that they accrue
right well i think they would you know someone on drugs probably misses more work
and then i guess that's why this smoking thing came out too
when they're and that's why i guess the car insurance has no nonsmoker rates or whatever as well
yeah
oh yeah
they
at least down here in texas they have
nonsmoker they call them discounts
they give you if you're a nonsmoker i guess there is some kind of studies that show
but if you're smoking
that's yeah i guess that takes effect in
when june july yeah
right there was a lot of controversy about that too i'm not a i'm not a smoker myself
yeah i'd probably get upset
yeah
right
right
right
right if they i assume if they
i guess they're saying with the cigarettes though that they've been able to show that it's the number one
leading cause of preventable
preventable
death in this country was a half a million people a year or so dying with smoke relating smoking related
and we do have one smoker in our area who and he
he seems to miss a lot of work
but
forty
eight maybe
yeah forty five forty eight
yeah but then there's people you talk to and say i've never been sick a day in my life you know so i guess i guess you know the studies show as an average
not specific cases and
i thought well with you know if that's really true then
then i guess i agreed with the extra premium
if it i mean if they can come along and prove that french fries
were the same deal then they have a right to charge for that too i guess
yeah that it's a major cause of early
right
well it depends if they're cooked in
yeah
right
right
right it it's the it's the honor system isn't it
it's the honor system i know it'll be an interesting experiment to see how
yeah
right
right well i think the same way with alcohol too
personally it you know that would probably be the next
the next thing
i mean
but you know there's the difference because they say you know
i guess they say tobacco is addictive i guess they say alcohol is addictive as well
oh yeah that's
there is oh there is
right
right
right
yeah well it's part of the business world too when you make
deals you know a lot of times it's
three martini lunch or whatever they say
right
yeah
yeah
makes me feel better
right
the nicotine addiction yeah
yeah i have my in-laws are both smokers and they've tried to quit
numerous times and
and i think the longest they've made it is about three months and then they go to a friend's house or something and there they're all smoking and
and they break yeah they just can't stand it you know all of a sudden they get it's overwhelming and then they break down and then they say i'm a failure and then they just give up you know
were known yeah
so
well i think we've probably talked long enough
well i can tell you're from you've got that new england accent
does that mean you're in new
massachusetts
yeah i have
my wife's grandparents are from boston they're
okay what kind of music do you like
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i listen i listen to a wide variety of music sometimes i'll turn on the classical music sometimes i'll listen to jazz every now and then country and western
i'll listen to some of the rock stations i also like the classic rock stations that play the older more mellow type
rock music some of the some of the rock stations now are the i guess the top forty stations or whatever they just it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials and
sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating and it gets kind of old and they play the same songs over and over and i just get kind of tired of all that
so lots of times i'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually but most of my cassettes i guess i don't i don't like hard rock
i have some rock and some jazz and couple of maybe one or two country and western some
oh i can't believe i can't think of his name garth brooks i have a couple of his tapes
and
but it's mainly it's mainly just the light rock type stuff
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
no i don't
i sure don't because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like gosh i have to go out and buy a cd player and then start collecting cds and it just i haven't gotten around to doing it yet
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's and a cd is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was too right now i think
they're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece
yeah
i bought some at christmas time for friends of mine that have cd players i thought my gosh now i know another reason why i'm not going to get a cd player for a while
right
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah see i've got a on my stereo i've got a turntable and then i've got a dual cassette so i can record off other cassettes
but i never realized you couldn't record onto i just never really thought about it because i haven't really looked into it very much i don't have one and i've never really looked at one very closely but that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car now i guess
until they now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a cd player that she got for christmas and she's got the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto cds i mean i'm sorry other way around off cds onto cassettes
so i can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to but
but i just haven't gone to cd yet
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well that's amazing how i used to when i was in college i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on mtv or something but ever since i've been out of college
i guess over the last several years
and then i listen to it when i'm in the car driving to work because again there's you know there's nothing else going on i might as well listen to the radio while i'm driving to work but other than that i've i really don't
i don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore i guess i'm just too busy doing other things that it's
too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to and put it on the on the turntable i don't know i just don't bother to do it very much anymore
um-hum
um-hum
that's good what instrument does he play
um-hum
uh-huh i've never heard of that
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is i was exposed to a lot of music when i was younger i my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years and
so i was i was a real good piano player but then i got interested in a lot of other things and i got real involved in many things and
and now i don't have a piano in my apartment or anything i could sit back down and play a few things but not like i used to be able to it's kind of sad that i've let that slip away
and i took guitar lessons i think for one or two years and
that was about the same time i was taking piano and then i got too busy in high school to really keep up with it between homework
oh that's a very interesting question the answer that i have is no in fact i was selected for jury at one time but fortunately for me or unfortunately just depending on your perspective
i had already changed jurisdictions and so i had to reply that i couldn't do it
was it civil or criminal
yeah well on the one hand there's a lot of positive things you're not at the whim of one person who might have a grudge or a
on the other hand
well
juries are not legally experts and they often just feel bad for somebody
but which is right they should often especially for example in a civil case
they'll feel bad for the person who got injured and not take into account any of the legal aspects of the incident and award large damages that were really undeserving from a legal point of view
right
yeah well it's hard you get when you get involved emotionally in somethings
so it
all the civic duty yeah
well i think one of the problems that we have here in the united states and the question didn't seem to focus on civil things they more focus on criminals
but from my perspective one of the problems is that in our bill of rights
we have it written that even for civil cases everyone's guaranteed a right to a jury as long as the dispute is for more than twenty five dollars
now twenty five dollars at the time that they wrote the bill of rights was a lot different than what it is now
and
basically what it means is they try to say you know like petty things you don't get a jury and nowadays that same twenty five dollars might be i don't know
ten thousand dollars i'm not exactly sure the economics involved
that's right and it makes it very
oh most cases most small cases for civil suits really shouldn't even have the option of a jury
i know we i was involved in a suit where the
you know long time ago there was an accident whatever and an ambulance chaser came by and wanted you know i don't know five or ten thousand dollars
and they requested a trial by jury
and it seemed like really stupid that they should even have that option for such a small amount that our founding fathers didn't understand the economic principles involved
pretty interesting yeah i have to have to agree with you
normally don't have time in the morning to watch the any type of tv usually catch it going to work on the radio
we have a one year old in the house so it's kind of hard sometimes to watch tv during the during the during the night but i usually try to catch the ten o'clock or
those type of issues i'd have to say during the war there were we were the american public was probably flooded with
too much information and as far as the sub question about was i am i satisfied with the coverage i'd have to say
yes but when it came to the war issues it was like who's telling the truth you between the channels there was
the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different and it was almost too much information over-communicated
true i agree with you
um-hum
yeah that's a good point but i would have to say across the board i'm satisfied with the way
yes
yeah
yeah i agree with you i i'm glad you mentioned that because i think i have to since i don't have the opportunity in the morning i'll probably catch the head lines on t news that's a good point
um-hum
yeah least
um-hum
well that's great
yeah i do surely do
anything else cross your mind i guess most of us go by the audio which is the television or the radio
yeah but you need to continue to read so you can people learn to read you know
hm
hm
did you get your catalog on your gifts
yeah they're not to shabby they're pretty good
yes sir
have a great day bye-bye
that's true um-hum i agree with you in the sense that i think that it's important for people to also share give something of themselves
and i think that there's too much
in the in a way of like self-gratification today
and there's not enough sharing
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah and i think the peace corps is great too because it you go to different countries and you see
you know in fact i saw an interview on tv the other night with patrick swayze and he's making a movie in
i think it's
calcutta or either india somewhere where it's a it's a very poor country
and he said that people in the west
he said since being there and i guess he's been there about six months he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed
and he said that people have no idea he said of what human sacrifice is you know since being there he's learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have
such a happy
yeah in other words they don't dwell on what they don't have they dwell on what they do have and they're happy with each other type of thing
and he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's completely changed his life
right
exactly
uh-huh
exactly right
yeah
right
uh-huh
well i know that it that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant how to find water and i've seen so many
extraordinary things on tv that people have done
working in the peace corps and how you know the people or the community they worked in is so much better
it's like one person can make a difference
and i really believe that they can in something like that
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
i know
yeah
right
uh-huh
i know
it's true it really is it's the sad life i think today it's
it's it it's not like it used to be even in the years of my growing up i mean i'm fifty three years old and i have seen a town change from a town to a city
and it's people you know grow from a small town to a large town
and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more
unto themselves kind of
right and it's not the sharing of a neighbor to a neighbor
and not even worry about it
but today i mean you know it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that
if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
in dallas they
i was going to say because i heard in fact i was talking to someone from dallas just last weekend they was saying that in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for ti and she had gone overseas to tokyo
and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone you know being a girl from another country and everything
and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said no there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
they said to her that even if she left her purse
on the subway
okay that she would have that purse returned to her
this is how confident they were okay with nothing missing
okay this is a foreign country
and you would think you know being an american or whatever you know a foreigner there that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you
okay
and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in and around dallas
and that's where she was from
she said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone
you know she had there are certain
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
and that that's why i think if people were more exposed to
especially young kids getting out of high school
i mean at one time they would go into the service to have the same exposure and you know to further their worldliness so to speak
and go to see foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see it was like they said join the navy to see the world type of thing you know
but nowadays they don't do that anymore it's not a thing a lot of young men don't even
have the desire to go into the service
or to you know do something for someone else
and i don't know i attributed i think a lot of that to women working
you know to the mothers not being at home
the bonding process yep
it very definitely is
that's right
yep
and the thing is like i think a man can afford to support a woman
but the woman affords the luxuries
in other words like anyone can live on a certain income no matter what it is you have to
so to speak okay it it's what's important to you
now a family i think that like girls today have children and six weeks later they're back to work
they don't even have a bonding with that child they don't ever see the
it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child the first like say six years of life
so much happens in that period of time
and i mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three
big deal i mean they're in school you're at work that's great but it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and the
okay the change how women's roles have changed
with the economy and with the dysfunctional families
possibly you know if they're doing it simply
if it's something that they need to fulfill themselves then that's something different too
that they should have the opportunity to do it and the quote homemaker's role should be divided equally between the partners
one thing that has not changed is
is the equality of pay among the sexes
and i don't see any great hope for that being changed in the near future quite frankly
but if you look at the people who make the decisions
the senate and the house they're primarily male
and
parent well a single person my children are grown and married but i still have to support myself
and i you know i personally i don't work because i want to get out there and do it i work because if i want to eat i'm out there working
well i did i didn't work while my children were young and i was married because i did want to give them the background that they got at home i did find afterwards though
or working parent were more independent
most of them
are working and it's not to buy the tvs and the new cars it's to survive
well even you know here our teachers are paid so poorly
and i don't know of any teacher whose wife is not having to work
so it's not just the men without a college education it's
our economy is really bad right now in oklahoma it's real bad
yes
we've been there we've been here for about three to five years now and it's really hurting
when you're working and you're married you're holding down two jobs one at home and one at
it
right i have never served on a jury i have been called like only twice in my life and
at the time i've been a legal assistant and nobody wanted me on their jury so i've been excused but
i don't know i look at the people who get excused and it's supposed to be a jury of your peers and i'm not sure it always is
and it is a it is a huge burden to put on people who don't know the law
you know that especially in criminal cases when you're deciding someone's life
i i'm not so sure that you know
that that's something that is
that you can really have the knowledge to do as just a lay person
you know you're told if you find them guilty then this is the choices that they have to make it's either life or death you know
it seems like in some of these cases i don't know that you could really have an impartial
juror because of the media given
and i don't you know in today's age of television the coverage like it is there's no way that you can be shielded from it
uh-huh
well i know when i've been you know called to jury duty they had to stand up there or stay you know until they dismissed me and i look at the people and the reasons that they get dismissed
before they even you know the selection is even started it is your profession you know nine tenths of them are your professional people
we still have an old texas instruments
professional computer
back in the days when ti was making computers that were similar to in terms of power to the ibm i don't remember what those were the ats or something like that or
the same stuff that we always have
well i used to i have a master's degree in computer science but i haven't i took a time out on careers about
six years ago when my first one turned a year old and
so nowadays i'm teaching him at home and we're using the computer to drill him on math and to let him do some
creative writing without having to have
the mechanics of
handwriting get in the way of his words this way he can
he this way he just has to hunt and peck on the keyboard i have to admit i'd like a
a more logical
arrangement of the letters and
what do they call it the cortiope or something
arrangement
we haven't for
we ended up
actually just sort of keeping it in the closet for a number of years isn't that a terrible statement people who are
we're pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other aspects but
i guess i wanted something that was easier to use than this and that was more intuitive and so we just
it just ended up not getting used i should use it to balance my checkbook
but then you have to remember to write it down
or enter it
oh my
where do you find a place to work on a ti
uh-huh
well that's nice to know that there are still such people around
yeah well i used to do that i'd used it until
as i say until i took a hiatus from working i used to
to
trying to think of what you call it i used it essentially as a terminal then
you know
and
so
yeah
well my kids think i should have games
write your own games yeah i just
oh
yeah
oh really
no who would do something like that
but
yeah we have basically we use the wordstar on it
you know for a bunch of
i'm taking a class now and
i'm actually getting a degree in nursing at this point and i asked the
and the class i'm taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed till now everything's been handwritten so it was a good thing that the computer was back up and running hooked the printer up to it
connectors in right and everything and had checked to make sure the pins were all facing the right way and i couldn't get the computer to recognize that there was a printer there to save my life and so i was like oh this thing doesn't work and we've lost the
you know we've lost the install software documentation what am i supposed to do so my husband took it in to
okay
well right now we have one dog inside
she goes out but i mean she's an indoor dog
and two outside cats
male and female
the dog's probably about thirteen fourteen years old and the cats are
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh is that right what kind of dog do you have
white
oh uh-huh i'll be darned
uh-huh
oh
yeah
uh-huh
well that's to be expected at their age
yeah
yeah we have five ah
well we have had we had a dog before she was fifteen when she died and this one we bought by accident a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this
go get her so that's how we got her quite by accident
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh
uh-huh
oh for heaven's sake
no but they say it's real important for children to have pets because well they can go and talk to them any time they want to and tell them anything they want to and
yeah
and the nursing homes now they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home
uh-huh
our one our one nursing home in brooksville has one
he kind of has free run of the place and there is or somebody takes care of him
but he goes up and down the halls visiting people and real nice dog and
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
oh
yeah
is that right
yeah because most campuses don't allow pets you know they just do not allow them
that's kind of great
yeah
yes yeah
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
well we've had a lot of different pets we had
the kids had rabbits for pets and we also raised them for food at one time
and we've had it we've had a skunk for a pet
you can't you could never call her and she would come to you had to go chase her down
and their eyesight they can't see very far either but
they before we got her everybody said oh they're just like a cat you know
oh my how long
probably seven or eight years
and we've had we've had cats two in the house we had we had two siamese cats
different times
one of them ran off she ran off once or he i guess it was a male he ran off twice and the second time he never came back
and we would see him several miles from our house he kind of moved into a woods down there and he got huge down there
he really grew but he never came back
well he wasn't a whole lot he was in the house most the time but he did go out sometimes and they it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside
yeah the cats my son has a cat and the vet had told us they get strange if they're kept in the house all the time and their cat was not a friendly cat it
was not a good
well i have two children so i don't have a whole lot of spare time right now one of the things that i've made time for is playing softball
i really enjoy i enjoy softball but i enjoy all kind of sports i enjoy watching and participating i really like water sports like swimming and skiing but i don't get to do that too often
and then i really enjoy sewing but i don't get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing how about you
uh-huh
i know it is do you work full time
part-time
oh
is this going to be your first
oh
uh-huh
yeah
right well that's
yeah that's neat
yeah i do too
yeah
yeah
well since i've had kids it's kind of funny i never really was much of a garage sale shopper -til i had kids but you'll probably find after your children get bigger
yeah oh you can just get all kinds of things and kids especially clothes and toys they just don't use them and wear them you know for that many years or anything
so i'm i've become a garage sale shopper and it is fun on the weekends i drive around look to see you know who's selling what and i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class and
yeah
yeah well
well that's good i'm glad
yeah well at first when you first have a baby you seems to take every moment of your time partly because you're not used to you know juggling your time around like that but
eventually the you'll be doing lots of stuff so
but i think my husband is real into sports too he plays on a ti softball team and a church softball team and by the time he plays two games a week and i play a game a week we go to lots of softball
but the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with and we that's getting outside and you know doing things they like to do too so
yeah and one other thing we're doing this year is we bought wet and wild passes
we've never done that before but the kids are always wanting to play in the water and like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play it's kind of hard
yeah i think it will yeah because my oldest daughter's in school and she gets bored real fast when she's home with nothing to do
so i think that'll be a lot of fun
so we're looking forward to that
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah another thing i enjoy doing is cooking i like especially it's real strange but i like to cook for other people like i have a friend that's pregnant but she can't get up and walk around right now
so i enjoy you know cooking things to take over to her house or
yeah
oh yeah
yeah when you're home it's it makes a difference it sure does
well do you guys go camping or anything like that
um-hum
yeah
well that's something we're plan on doing not this weekend but the next my parents go camping a lot
and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them and
yeah we're really looking forward to it the girls love it they've been a couple of times and just getting to be outside you know all the time and sleep in a tent and that's really fun to them so
we're looking forward to that
yeah i think so
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh i know yeah she's really looking forward i'm hoping that's another thing though when sometimes your
hobbies can interfere with each other because my husband's afraid he's going to have a softball tournament that weekend and i'm saying no yeah if you're doing a lot of things sometimes you have conflicts and you have to decide what you enjoy the most so
yeah
yeah
yeah i crocheted when i was younger it's funny when i was in high school i made a blanket and
but
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah well i did the same thing when i was pregnant with my first daughter i was really bored and i bought one of those latch hook rug kits
oh it was a real pretty rug and i thought well i could use this as a gift or something you know and oh it was so it's beautiful but i did not realize how long it took and i got about two thirds of it done
but for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big hobby it seemed like people did them a lot people don't do that much anymore so it was something easy i could do
yeah
yeah you too
oh thank you and thanks for calling bye-bye
oh well i'm not an expert i just had a little i've seen a little pollution in my time it's
that's really a pollution issue i think pollution issue is
is the argument over people catching things like respiratory disease
well did you see carl sagan on sixty minutes on when he was talking about when if the if the war started in kuwait and they'd set those all
it was it was it was interesting but i'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit
yes and his argument was that you would see a year with no summer
which actually happened it yes it actually happened
anyway research people and they said that the that the pollution would not go high enough
and it's going to be interesting to see if carl sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake but
yeah i do
but i'm i do that in my formalize
no i'm a planner a production planner
but i i'm in the active reserves as a weatherman so
i keep up from time to time but what the argument is that maybe there isn't global warming and maybe there is
but if there is
we probably could do something about it now and if there isn't if there isn't and we do some the right things i think how do you feel about all this smog and stuff on cars
well do you have an older car
i'm not having any problem it's a seventy
and
but did you have another you said you had another question
yeah
no i didn't see that i know that the that's
well that they talked nuclear winner and i suppose that's the ultimate pollution problem
well
well it's interesting that the chernobyl accident actually because the circulation budget as high as it went
covered
a fairly remarkable amount they did some tracers and they i think it's drawn in i think
gets in there because i can't think of the other trace but i saw a presentation on that and they it went quite a long ways but i guess
i can be a little sympathetic but you know there's some argument that in the blue grass of kentucky that the smoky mountains
that that's the pine trees giving off pollution and
but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in dallas and see all that haze from west texas is that is that pollution
well it that's the thing is that i think i think dallas really does have a problem in this the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel
burning fuel the problem is it's like los angeles people don't people don't want to use mass transit so
but who wants to who wants to ride a bus
well my boss drives forty miles one way each day
and one of the guys that works with me drives forty five miles
and they don't think it well i guess they do think something of it but
not enough to
you know you consider how much
but then you get into all these issues of whether it it's the types of pollution and what it's doing to your lungs and are we going to die of respiratory so we all move out of the
out of downtown so we get away from the smog my wife grew up in southern california and they moved out to the valley
before los angeles when the valley was clean
and now the valley is not and so people move out one more valley and
yes
well do you know
general motors apparently has one that they're testing i think it's
no it's alcohol vehicles that they're testing almost
but they
suppose
huh well the road and track was talking about that this apparently general motors has some they apparently think they're close
well there's still a lot of research i was over in the research lab a couple i guess it's been about a month ago and saw this
there have been research it was a little light that says solar powered research
yeah well do you work in that c building
oh well i'm at
oh well i'm in i'm in the c building been there for all my life
huh
well the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon
you know
well i thought i saw an ad for volkswagen that had an alcohol
they had one with spots on it and something i didn't go but it was showing they i mean
an article
no i didn't i didn't go so i wish
they've done a lot
well there
well they it's interesting though because my cars are older and so i didn't have to if you live in dallas county
you have to have your have to have it checked and it's great i had a friend with a fiero that they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of trouble getting that pinned and so apparently
there you go okay
right
oh i know it builds up really fast
uh-huh
yeah we do we have two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds up with us
yeah
oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah
yeah
yeah
or it just builds up so often yeah
yeah
they used to have several places that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable
so finally they the people put so much pressure on the city they did a survey of everybody and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic
and put it in front of the wal-mart store in town and they it just really every time you went by there it was just over flowing
and so wal-mart complained
so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be
oh it was just like a dump there and so finally you know i called and they said you know it was behind there and i started taking my things behind there
so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it
you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area
in one neighborhood and they have pickup there it's i think once or twice a week
and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message
yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going
they'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it's not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it's not going to be i don't think
yeah i do to because it's amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little
mulch home with you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea i thought
yeah
oh yeah it's really it adds up so fast yeah
yeah well they're working on diapers which would be great i've read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that originally they thought the disposables were just awful
but now their saying that they're there really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so
the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off
so i don't know what's the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those
but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too so
yeah
yeah
it does and you just feel guilty if you don't do something with them you know because you hate to contribute to the problem but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either
yeah i don't know what else they could recycle more of i guess we don't really use that many tin cans i guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum but i don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in i don't know if those are recyclable or
yeah
yeah we don't either
we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we don't really have much of that but
yeah well now when we lived out in california they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car
or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say it's not safe to put those things in the regular trash
yeah
yeah
well other than that i'm not really sure we try to recycle old clothes
our church has a place where you can take them and they you know pass them on to other families so
yeah
oh
uh-huh kind of like a goodwill kind of place yeah
yeah
yeah that's real helpful too
yeah
okay
you to take care bye-bye
oh really
well i didn't realize that i thought all of it was ti employees in the survey i didn't i was the other way around i didn't realize there were outside people in the survey so
i am not positive i probably have gotten about the same information you have because i don't work anywhere even near that division i'm in even in a completely different site so
i know that once they get through with this i i've read where they're they may call certain people back for like the second phase or something i'm but i'm not really sure i mean i know you know why they're gathering the information right
oh you don't what they're what they're working on is the way i understand it is the computer system
that you know in the future and who knows how far in the future they believe that computers will be able to understand human voice where instead of having to have a keyboard and press in what you want the computer to do
you'll be able to tell it what you want it to do and that's why they're gathering the voices in order to do research to enable computers to be able to do that
right that's exactly right
direct a machine huh
i'm in lewisville which is just north of dallas just about thirty minutes north of dallas yeah so
did you
sure
yeah
yeah we really do we really do unless you're doing it
there is there is it's that way anywhere you go
yeah that's fine go ahead
oh my goodness
oh really
uh-huh
oh wow how wonderful
uh-huh
you sound like you've gotten very lucky you really have
yeah
good
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah oh definitely we kind of went through a situation with my father my father was a he was pronounced a diabetic when he was thirty and had diabetes for all you know many years and
you know didn't take quite as good care of himself in the beginning as he should have i mean he was put on insulin immediately but his diet he wasn't as careful with as he should have been in the beginning so he deteriorated rather quickly and
by the time he was in his mid fifties which is very young he was he was nearly blind and was going into kidney failure and couldn't
couldn't walk for very long periods of time the muscles in his neck and that type of thing had deteriorated to the point that he always had to have something to lean his head back against and you know we were you know myself and my two sisters were
you know in the situation of a fifty seven year old father looking in to put him in a nursing home which was which was at i'm know it it's scary isn't it yeah i mean it was
it was just a horrible situation for us to you know to be in and we just you know because of course like you say like your mother his mind was perfect and wonderful it was he just could not get around to take care of himself
and we ended up opting for a live-in nurse and you know that came into his home and we set her up a room in a spare room and she stayed there with him instead because we just could not imagine
a fifty seven year old man in a nursing home we just you know we just could not could not imagine doing it
and we knew that it wouldn't you know we couldn't even do the live-in nurse thing forever you know and but he was just so against and when you said your mother knew that this is probably where she needed to be it was such a different story because he was
so against going to a nursing home which at that age i can't blame him you know it would just it just scared him to death to be you know that young and who knows you know the thought of being there another twenty or thirty years you know just was just
too much for him you know so we you know we opted for that route so i kind of know what you mean about the trauma of you know the thought of doing it you know it was just
it was just very hard but i guess you know there's good ones and there's bad ones i think you just have to be so very careful you know and
you know you're lucky if you do have a situation where the mind is still good and they can tell you if they're being well taken care of i think otherwise you end up with serious problems
you know
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
well you know
that was another situation because my this was my father lived in missouri and was in a little small town of about three thousand and we just got very lucky and found a woman
and we just got extremely lucky to find someone who was willing to do it and she stayed five days a week and spent the night
but did go home on weekends and then we found another girl who had been kind of coming in and helping dad clean and do that kind of thing for several years who said that she was willing to stay on the weekends and help him
well we only we only did that for i guess that went on for about all not quite six months he passed away after six months there at home which
we were very thankful that we were able to keep him at home and that you know he did pass away at home and rather than being in a nursing home i know he was much happier spending that six months at home
you know definitely so
they were they had been divorced many years earlier yeah so he was he was alone and really had you know and
and my youngest sister was about an hour and a half away in college and i was you know down here six hundred miles away and then my the third sister was in atlanta georgia you know so we weren't really
well we were even right there where we could take care of him you know so it was really a hard situation you know when in this society where everybody kind of gets spread out it's not as easy as it used to be to take care of aging parents you know it you know
it's hard to move them in with you or you move in with them or even you know drop in everyday you know you just
yeah
uh-huh
that's a that's a real trying experience to try to you know to move back in and live harmoniously together after all those years it's
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
wonderful
oh that's wonderful
um-hum
uh-huh
doesn't make it easy no
oh
no doubt no doubt
well i have two cats
i have two cats because i can't have dogs where i live i i've wanted a dog i owned a we had dogs when i was growing up all the time
and you know our cats are very interesting and we never owned cats when i was growing up so this is a
it's been a really neat kind of learning experience for me they've blown all my preconceptions about cats
so do you do you have pets
uh-oh do they get along
uh-huh
oh did the dog the dog like know that there was a cat and
hum
yeah
yeah that's actually why we got our second cat i we thought our cat needed a pet
you know you tend to personify these things but our cat thinks our oldest cat thinks that it should be a person and our youngest cat actually thinks it's a cat
so it works out pretty well
uh-huh
yeah
feed them and all that
yeah you know an interesting story is i have a friend who has a cat that actually knows how to open tender vittles bags
so if they go on a trip they just leave the bags on the kitchen floor and the cat'll go and open one when it wants to eat
i'm i swear to god it's like you know the i guess it earlier time it would have to figure out how to use a can opener but you know now it it's pretty self sufficient i just think
they say you own a dog and you feed a cat and i think that that's pretty much pretty much true
yeah i it blew me away
um-hum
uh-huh
oh really
we usually had rifle cleaning parties on the front porch when you know you move into a bad neighborhood you have your have all your friends over play the grateful dead and clean your rifles and they pretty much get the idea
but the dog i guess would work too
well it is a big dog
oh okay
oh
wow well see they say that the mixed breeds have a better temperament anyway all that inbreeding that they do that they have to do to maintain a pure blood line i guess makes them really weird
the dreaded hip dysplasia
um-hum
she's
maybe she is part greyhound huh
well the last vacation i went was to cozumel and that was last march and april
not at this point
although if we take another vacation i think we might like to go to cancun this time have you been there
i agree i mean if i'm going to go on vacation i want to lay out in the sun and relax
and someplace i'd like to go is like to the other side of the caribbean as you know as opposed to the mexican side i want drink rum drinks and
lay on those beaches over there
that sounds good another place that i heard is really pretty is the cayman islands
although i hear they're expensive
well our tenth anniversary is coming up in october uh-huh yeah and
i'd like to you even if we just get away for three or four days i think it would be kind of neat
just to do something originally a couple years ago we were hoping to do a trip to greece
but i don't think that's going to be possible now
now that is probably the number one place on earth that i would like to go um-hum
like where
well the main place that nick would like to go is rio
um-hum he's been talking about that for years
that's up in michigan yeah we talked about doing one of those drive around trips you know you drive around
i guess lake michigan and then you take the ferry over to the other side and um-hum
but i'd only want to do that in the summer
no neither am i
well nick just got back from san diego last night and he said it was absolutely gorgeous and i haven't been there since i guess it was seventy three
and i'd love to go back that was just one of the prettiest places on earth i have ever seen
how do you work in a business trip
well since you already set up the office out in southern california there's nothing left for me
and it doesn't appear we're going to be opening any new offices
that'd be all right
that's right i'll go anywhere
um-hum
you can do that yeah
as a matter of fact i was offered a free ticket air ticket today if i want one
well
eventually i might but archie offered me a ticket um-hum
and i thought we'd you know i wouldn't want to just take it but he has american and a couple of other ones and he said they just go to waste
and i nick's going to new orleans in january i think next year i haven't been there for so long
yeah or watch the people or the hookers go up and down the street
oh i saw them in
san diego i went to a shore a show you know one of those transvestite shows
that was something
okay
okay now do you push the buttons now
okay talk to you later bye
i do at times off and on right now i'm probably in one of the more the more off times
oh it works fine it's just i think sometimes i you know you get busy you slack off a little bit and then
you know there's no more i mean you know then it's work to catch up
you know then the two or three times where i've got to the point i really needed one i created one and stuck by it
yes how about you
hm
the budget i stuck on the most
was the budget i was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget
and basically ten percent of your income goes to
long-term savings
twenty percent goes toward
basically short-term you know doing going out to dinner
like going to the movies maybe you know saving that part up toward like going on you know something a little more short-term than like the long-term budget
and then the and then seventy percent goes toward you know paying debts and that kind of stuff with the whole idea being that you pay yourself first you're more likely to stick with it
hm
sure
i will be a week from next monday
no not really
yeah so far for now i think i mean for now we've still got our own money really
and that'll probably it'll probably be that way till you know we like buy our own house together or something
in which case you know it's very convenient to once again throw everything together
right
yeah and right now in my case it's more situation that she
has still got a lot of debt
and it's easier for me to kind of like just shoulder
the normal stuff
and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt
well i was the year before and that was the last time i really got on a budget was to really fight being in debt because i didn't like it
so
i think it's people in general
yeah you have a that's a tendency to do it when you can
one of the ways i insure my long-term savings is the fact that you know i've got a 401k plan so i've got
five percent of my income going into that that's actually five percent before taxes
that you know so that's even more and then i've also
you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions
yeah
right well i've even got a fifty dollar a month mutual fund automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month
you know once again you know you know it's there you know it's going to happen
it's a
an easier way to
to save
well sure you know you know like you said for right now we really kind of each have our own money which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but
right
well the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so
i think a lot of it has to do with women working
yeah
yeah
right
and it and it seems if you're going to have kids that you are
and because if you have you know two well if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care two or three you know
uh-huh
oh that is good
yeah steve's steve has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in march and she doesn't have to work either i don't know how they do it
i don't know how people do it with one you know obviously
yeah obviously we don't have any and i don't i think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married
and not have kids and i think for society for such a long time said well you know you're married now you need to have your family and i don't think it's been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family
you know and
right
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh yeah i mean just the you know the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and
stuff
oh i know i know
jeez
yeah
yeah
but that's probably because you know if you had three you know would say if i'd of had four i guess it's always not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah and that's all right with me because i don't want to stay home you know i think i'm just part of the new stuff that is just
i don't know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long
yeah
yeah
right
that's you did that's what you did
yeah
yeah
yeah
i like the way it is it's being see we're from houston and so it's not so hard
for people you know you've been married three or so years and you don't have kids well it's okay nobody does but you come to a place like belton
and a lot of the kids here get married out of high school it's real small town
and it's and a lot of people in our we're the only couple in our sunday school class except for one other couple who are in their forties and they can't have children who don't have children and they can't imagine why we would want to have children and i'm going well you know
there's more to life you know there's life in there that's you know not everybody has to have kids and i'd rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time here it's your turn you know
uh-huh
yeah i think that's what it is i'm not either
they're probably going oh i bet she can't get pregnant
yeah
yeah
uh-huh right
yeah
yeah steve's mom finally
finally you know said that god will take care of us when it's our time
she finally admitted you know she finally told me it's okay if you don't but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very old fashioned family
and she stayed home and raised her kids and she expected all of her kids to do that too and their wives and to be the housewife and have dinner ready by five and you know be there at every beck and call and
uh-huh
right
yeah i think you've earned that though
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah i think so i think it would be neat if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both
a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you
uh-huh
are they
right
yeah i don't know if the ti in dallas does or not i know i know nobody around here does it we're it's too small around here yeah
not very often i usually the ones we use is like visa and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month
i have
right
yeah
that's right
do you have a lot of credit cards
right
oh yeah
which is what they want
i think a lot of people go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it but really i mean if they don't have the money then they aren't going to have it in a month so
they make the mistake of pushing all their cards
yeah
right
it took me quite a while to pay them off
so
after that i decided well i'm not going to use them at all
and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then
we got married so we decided to you know if we used them we would
pay them off as we go so
right
that's true yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
oh
yeah
right i think the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards you know with a big write off at the end of the year
but now it's like it's punch money because
you cannot
right you cannot write off your interest
yeah
yeah you too thanks for calling bye
well i think there's a big waste of our tax dollar
we don't we it there's too much
pocket stuffing going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the county and
do projects for the state and you know course they prove that all the time on over the tv
you know
but i
right that i just i just pay you know more taxes than i can imagine if i could get i've got a little piece of property
i just i mean when i tell you little piece of property i mean i've got five and a half acres it's out in the country
and if i could get what they're charging me for taxes on that i would sell it in a minute
you know so that that's why i just don't
there's a lot of you know a lot of expense
as far as our taxes and all the all the hidden costs that they spend our money on that they shouldn't be spending our money on
but
it does
really does are you an accountant or
uh-huh
right well you know i've i can handle the i can handle the tax the amount of taxes that i pay i can handle that
but it
you know when you hit all the bad roads and
and you hear of all the misuse of the money and that
that's a that's a bigger
problem to me than having to pay them
right
well i think i think one of our and this is really not the total thing not totally on taxes but one of our things is our on our the our
federal government is our why in the world they don't get rid of
one of the houses either get rid of the senate or get rid of the congress you know get rid of one of those housing systems and because that's costing that's costing the taxpayer multimillions
and but they govern each other and they vote their selves in to staying in where they are you know and
i don't i've never understood you know why i there is one state what state is in the united states that only has one housing i meant one governing body
okay there is there's one state i've i in i don't know whether it's new hampshire it's a northern state
or new england state that has one housing body and one governing body and
you know they their taxes are
more well spent
but no i've you know i disagree with a lot of things but a lot of things i can't change
but
what part of the country are you from
okay
i'm course i'm
i'm from texas too but i think my the two counties that i pay taxes in are two of the highest tax rate counties there are anywhere around here
so
i live in my i have some my little piece of land is in benedict county and i live in smith county
texas
still in texas you hear this texas accent
well i think we pay it in other ways
i think we i really think we pay it in a lot of other ways it's funny to me too that why the government taxes has a higher tax rate for a single person
than they do for a married couple
yeah
oh yeah
well that's lucky
yeah that's good
um-hum
oh
wow
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah i can see that
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh i bet
yeah
i when i was i was a commercial artist for almost six years before we started our family and i looked into child care and
and we were living in we were living in dallas my husband was working at the north building at the time and we just didn't like anything we saw we really i didn't want to leave an infant
with the child care that was in it in the immediate area
yeah
right oh that's exactly what it was with us it was just it was we all we had to do was we pay off a vehicle early
and then i would have just been paying for that and child care was my salary and it wasn't worth it
so it was
no it's not
yeah it is so expensive down here for a child care because we're originally from missouri and most of our family's still there and my husband's sisters have their kids in child care and it's a lot less expensive then it is down here
it's amazingly less expensive than it is
yeah oh it oh yeah
wow
that's lucky
that's lucky
uh-huh
really
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
wow
yeah
yeah
yeah
i know oh it is it plus when we were in the section of north dallas over by addison there's just not hardly any day care over there at all it's surprising
because of the when i was searching for it the best place i could find in the area was it was way down in farmers branch and i worked in carrollton it just and i was i was going to have to drive and drive and drive and it was just it was just
like up here in mckinney there's a few places there's i think there's i've seen two up here
and there's just really not very much
that's true
oh yeah a lot of people drive into dallas from here a lots of them
so
yeah i assume so
okay
okay well nice talking to you bye
yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or
state school
okay but you're excluding high-level education
okay
yeah i know down here the school's are you know i don't know they rate i moved to arkansas and texas after living in ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and
having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on
right
well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i'd already done
because we were so far advanced and the you know i'd been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools
so you know i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier
and then you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over
well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the better parts of the metroplex the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools
but you know
right
or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know there's no point in you know i'm an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know i'm not going to use them
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed
right in high school
right
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don't care
and
right
yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them just want to go play
yeah that's true i'm wondering with the boom down here it's well not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward
so oh i don't know
i say we because i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years
yeah
right
you hope
i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the state the federal government you know where's the money supposed to come from is it
you know what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got
yeah
starts hitting closer to home
yeah they're a lot more strict
you have to learn you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time
well i know i'm in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the university of texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school
i don't think i'm getting what i should but you know in texas it's next to free because they pay so much of it it's state supported
but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to mit my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of mit and that's it's really too bad
but that's i don't know i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and junior colleges that don't have the background for an mit kind of curriculum so
okay what kind of foods would you have
hum-um
uh-huh
well yeah you can't enjoy it right
we just had a bunch of people over and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and ah yummy
oh good
i'd say one thing we've have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's a real easy is just baked potato dinners
and have you like three or four couples come over and i'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like
and it turns out great because i mean you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff
but it's inexpensive plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it and you got a great dinner
it's we invariably end up at my house since i've got two kids and that it's fine because then i can just say okay fine you bring this you bring this you bring this we're done oh it's pretty cool
uh-huh
oh
oh
hm
oh
over the uncooked rice
oh
oh how neat
huh now i've done it with where you put you cook the well i guess you probably could do it some way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and a bit of white wine in it
and every once in a while i'll put in white i'll slice white grapes and i'll put it in there and
that's because i'm not a real big wine person but i like it adds something to the chicken and then just bake it and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice
oh yeah
but then i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice so just like in a thirteen by nine pan
hm
hm
uh-huh
huh
yeah it's i use that for rice and for when i cook pasta or something i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor
hm now that would be good how long do you have to bake it
how long would it be in the how long would it be in the microwave
oh okay
okay hm
or chopped onions if you wanna do that you know whatever you however much effort you feel like putting into it but it makes a great i mean i've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it
and because my daughter calls it her gravy and i mean she thinks it's wonderful i'm like good you're a picky eater if i can get you to
well
the only remodeling we do is we put new we put up molding and wallpaper and we put it up in chad's room and in the
front room
but i let the
yeah i don't do the actual
putting i don't actually cut them the molding i mean we have a guy come in and do that and we do the painting and the sanding and then i built some shelves in the basement last week so i guess that qualifies
crown molding and then some chair molding but
i guess maybe we will have to do some new projects when the baby comes
yeah well you know we got the tv in this room
that's probably have to be converted to a bedroom so
any remodeling really
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
i think i might paint the cement you can there's supposedly kind of a cement paint you can get that will make it just a little nicer even you know before we finish it
well parts of the cement had a patio i painted the our porch
they work pretty well really they're noisy
yeah
you haven't used it at all
oh so you don't you don't know how wait the only thing you've got to worry about is getting the paint the right viscosity
you've used one before though it sounds like
yeah
um-hum
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah it puts out a lot and i mean i even us that one when we did that porch
yeah
it was just it was white
yeah because the porch the porch spindles are white
and
it was a latex we had a kind of hard time getting it thin enough latex is kind of rubbery to begin with a little thicker than most but it ended up working fine plus i was the weather you know i did it in
well the winter started to cool down i think it must have been october when i finished
yeah i remember it was a conference weekend i think when i finished
yeah was it was not bad but
is it
yeah
hum-um
yeah
right
or if it doesn't even have to be commies if it's just a little left of what the prevailing attitude is in the united states it was bad somehow and
certainly the right wing death squads were just as
deadly if not more so than anything set up by any of the left wing governments
if people are coming from left wing countries it was viewed that they were
only seeking economic benefits and not actually escaping death threats
whereas if they were coming from am i saying this correctly or if
if they were coming from right wing regimes
we wouldn't let them in yeah
um-hum
oh gosh what an embarrassment
no with
right what was the whole thing with panama i mean here we were paying noriega for years
and then suddenly
we go in and bomb his country and
in panama and try and indite him i don't understand what that was all about
and
truly
right it's sort of it's our little colony is that they do just if they provide the labor and the debiting of
of ford or
the
united fruit then that's fine
but if they're actually trying to educate
well you called here so
well i agree to an extent i think the problem is that
we're spending money and one of the things that the government likes to do when they're under public pressure is to throw money at the problem
and i think that while we need to spend more effort and money on things like education and maybe even alternative treatments and alternative things to keep those afflicted alive at this point
i think that any money that is given must be given carefully just to something that is a proven point not just thrown at it
i don't see that the money is being removed from any other causes
aids has been a problem though especially in the eighties
when there wasn't a lot of private dollars around because of the stigma of the disease
and that people really didn't groups didn't wanna be associated with it because it was a morals issue
i think that it we need to spend a lot more on education and try and get over this thing that we have about
not confronting this head on with some factual advertising for items of condoms and things like that
well the problem is that with this administration at least when they say abstinence
they often couch that in other things that turn into one of these morals issues
which makes it turn into a political issue now you see the problem is you have people in the national institutes of health in atlanta and the like the centers for disease control which
have fundamentalists in charge of the thing who won't even let you say condom in a meeting
and these things have been spread around and immediately people think well abstinence okay here we have these religious zealots telling us
where they're trying to ignore the problem blah and of course they overreact when you say that the fact that it's just good medical safe practice you know don't expose yourself in the first place
but the it's because the you know this administration was around when reagan when the disease first was discovered here and all the social you know implications of the reagan administration ignoring it when it first became an issue and
see that's all carrying over now
and that's why you're seeing that
yeah there is because what happened is a lot of these people and staff members are political appointees
from the south especially who come along with a variety of different religious beliefs
some of which held very fervent beliefs
and will take their beliefs into the workplace in and in this case a lot of people consider that to be standing in the way of science and medicine to try and solve this thing
but i don't like throwing money at the problem
do you have kids
we have two and another one on the way
well we yeah we do we have a our a six year old he's oldest and then our baby will be a year on monday
yeah
two boys two boys yeah
no i i'm just about three months and i don't think we really even wanna find out we like surprises so we'll take either
and does it are the two boys first
oh
maybe huh we kind of like our boys though too so
oh my goodness
oh
oh yeah you've kind of got a span there huh oh well what do you do with your seventh grader
do you have horses
she just she knows people that does huh
oh does she oh she must really like them
advanced
yeah i have heard of that our little boy's just in the first grade and i taught school
oh uh-huh
oh yeah i bet huh well so does she go actually out into a different classroom with
with other kids that are involved in this
yeah
oh uh-huh
oh that's neat
challenging huh oh
yeah
well as far as our activities we're kind of on a different level here but my
yeah my husband's gonna take our six year old to the monster truck show tonight
but we don't have any real like we don't really ski we haven't taken our kids skiing or anything course the baby's young
yeah he's
the what
oh well yeah we have done that he in fact he just goes right out here we've got quite a bit of snow now and last week we got a lot
oh
yeah
it is fun
yeah i no i don't like that i really i it makes me nervous yeah
yeah oh i don't mind it but us the winter gets long
you know i get ready if that come about this time of year i'm kind of ready for it to start getting spring and it's too early yet so
yeah
okay so do you have any favorite teams
not quite huh
well that's pretty good
yes i'm actually a met's fan i'm one of these people who's actually a
die hard met fan and an avid yankee hater
yeah it's i find it very strange more people you know real met fans don't like the yankees and real yankee fans don't like the mets for some reason
i never i never quite found a new york fan
i've always found a fan you know of either one or the other and
so that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox
by default because i went to college also in boston
oh
yeah so that that's sort of close enough
oh so you were pretty close
well i don't know there's a part of me that says that you know i'm sort of glad strawberry went away
you know when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well but he really wasn't worth the baggage you know
i think they're okay i think they're you know i think they have enough people who are
who are who are still in their prime you know i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know
i certainly don't think that they're the eighty six team anymore
yeah i
right that was year they beat houston in extra innings and then and then they actually won the series by
by sort of a sneaky route against boston
i felt real bad about that but hey what can you do
that's right well actually he was supposedly there was there was something wrong with him at the time and i
right and i and i understand that and i say hey if the guy can't play you don't blame the team that hit it to him you blame the team you know for putting him in
that's right so
so i was i was also i was in school at boston at the time
so i it was actually wonderful because where i was there were half met fans and half sox fans
oh
after the
well that's good well yeah brooklyn boys i guess
yeah so i was also born in brooklyn so i so i can call myself a brooklyn thug although i'm really not
yeah
well that that's actually i think that makes something because i think and as much as sort of fan support helps
you know it's good to have
yes it is kind of small
right
oh that's
oh that's great so
and
yeah exactly
i haven't been to any toronto games yet but
of stadiums yeah well i mean to get up there i mean the best i've been up here so far you know up in up state new york is
a rochester red wings game
cornell is in ithaca
yeah so cornell is about somewhere about two and a half hours south of south and east of us
so if you know where lake ontario is sort of
yeah we're about ten miles south of lake ontario actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city
but that
oh really i hadn't actually known that
well
but we have our own our own triple a team here
the redwings which is the farm team for the orioles so everybody hopes that they go all the way around here they're the they're the big team in rochester
oh i yeah i actually we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun because they're
lots of really big you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know
especially you know and i'll make a day game or something but they really seem to people really get into it i mean i
i can't i again i can't make any predictions about them but i suspect they'll go they'll go far
yeah those are those are always the i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
yes it's true well
it's one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are you know i guess when you start pitching real well move them up bam you know there goes the little the worst team
yeah but so what
well the way i the way i see it is i mean you know i can use a met analogy here
if you'll think back a few years to when the mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of
well trained you know back to the you know maybe eighty four or eighty three or eighty five you know when they were first when they weren't quite the eighty six team that they were
i that probably gives the readers a good shot for you know this year or next year i think it you know the young talent really sort of has to build itself up
right but that that's if
oh that must be nice
yeah well it'd take me a good seven hours to get to shay stadium
so i don't know i don't
yeah well actually we can we can i can take a highway the whole way down but it's still it's
barring traffic so it's it it's you know it's a heck of a drive we are substantially north of new york enough that we don't get to go play
too often
toronto
i can i've actually i've driven
but i've heard about the ferry as well haven't taken it yet though have you taken it
yeah i really love i think that's one of the most enjoyable things about being up here i'm only up here for school
so i
no probably south maybe texas actually
right now we're actually having
it's getting nice i mean it was in the high fifties today but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm
oh that's great
yeah well about that same time branches were falling off everywhere and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks
okay it didn't make the national news too much which i find really weird
but we were i mean you know all schools were closed for almost for over or for a week
there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive
yeah because they had so many power lines down and so many
and so many things like that so they were
okay well i think the court systems could stand some improvement
trial by jury is good but a lot of time it
in a lot of cases
is circumstantial evidence that convicts a person which i don't think is all the time good because
sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent
i mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have a eyewitness
and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me i don't know
i think so
um-hum
right
um-hum
you think you prefer the jury you think your chances are better
well that's true
um-hum
well sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair
i mean even if well the jury i guess they do decide that but i'm like you in a case like that most time its
i don't know maybe i'm too
conservative when it come to that the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases
you know
right
yeah
um-hum
right
oh really
yeah that's not a bad system
but i do think it need to be shaken up a little bit but the thing is too maybe they need more of
i don't know more of a expert types
to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know joe blow or whoever
and a good citizen or whoever and call them in
right exactly
yeah
um-hum
putting on a act or whatever
oh they range from
from needlepoint to
anything in the hobby field as far as needlework is concerned
i've had to give it up recently because i've got problems with nerves in my right hand but basically it's anything in that hobby line i'll try anything including making earrings
i have no love of yard work for hobby work though how about you
oh fantastic
oh
i've been in a
glider
which as a student piot pilot
i loved it immensely
as a student pilot yeah
i was only in one trip
it was something i would have liked to have kept up but we moved out of colorado so that was you know that ended that point
but yeah that i'll try as far as you could say hobby then i'll try anything that's unusual that i've never done once
just to find out what it's like the experience oh as
but that's not a constant hobby you know like i'll do oh i'll pick up normally a petit point or anything in stitchery type of line
and if i'm really bored i'll even pick up something and color it
but i do a lot of designing also
well i've done a petit point which is really extremely hard
and that was very difficult for me it took me oh i think that almost took me a year and a half to finish that
and petit point is like if you've seen
regular needlepoint it's one half of that in the stitches
and it goes down like real small little tiny it's exactly what it says petit point
yes it was tedious i dropped it as i said it took me about a year and a half because it's not something i could continuously do
but now i'm into more taking something that i like and trying to actually put it onto paper myself
which i find more enjoyment that's got a lot of math to it at that point
this last one i'm trying to do a house there's a house here in plano actually it's a real estate office
but it has
it's oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure
it goes from almost castle looking on one side to a very old fashioned look on the other side and it just varies in each little section of this real estate office
and i think they did it because of that purpose it is a real estate office
but it fascinates me the way they've done it and it's it looks good it's all done in brick the windows even vary on it
and that's it really fascinates me so i've sat across the street from it and i've tried to put it down on the paper now
it's on
let's see fifteenth and park
well i live right around here
but it's not if you drive by it you don't notice it
because it's all brick there's no difference in the front except you can see the little difference if you actually stop and take a look at it
that's why it fascinates me
but again you know i'd like to be able to go ahead and take that someday and actually make a house of my own
well see you're doing the same thing when you're doing your gazebo you're playing with numbers
that's all this is you putting it on paper so you're just playing with numbers
it's like i would love to play with work but i don't have the strength in my hands
anymore to do anything like that but i've put up
like a wall board fixed a bedroom and put in a bath
yeah i have a small miter box for hobby mitering
and it does the same thing what you're saying but i'd like to which i've been trying to find to go into as far as a permanent hobby which because i'm having difficulties with this is to go into i'm sure you've seen it is those wood
oh they're wood pictures on the wall but if one move if one part moves it counterparts the other parts
and so like it's a continuous counterpart around it
and it's all made out of wood
and i have as i said i have a miniature
miter box which is made for hobby works
and i've had that for quite a few years now but i haven't really gone into that part i've been thinking about making
oh ladders and everything for my pocket parrot because they're hard to find toys for a pocket parrot they make them for parrots and they make them for cockatiels and a pocket parrot's between the two
and so i need rings that are exactly between those two sizes so i'm going to i've got some designs for i go into the pet stores but you can say again another hobby i've got is my birds so
hum
i have a cockatiel and a pocket parrot
but
other than that
sam cockatiel talks he whistles at me and says good morning
he picked up most of his sayings from the other cockatiel i had the pocket parrot is a very quiet bird it's an extremely tame bird
it's if you're real gentle with it when you buy it it'll come out and sit on your shoulder with no problem
yeah they're a very tender bird
well see when i was oh about i guess about ten years ago fifteen years ago
i don't know if it's been that long i took my dog my cat and my bird into the vet at the same time
and he was just sitting there he goes carol you're the only one i know of that does this and i go what's the problem because i never thought about it i had never thought one thing at all about it and of course the dog and the cat and the bird are all out of the cage
and my bird at that time was picking the feathers out from underneath his wing
and he finally said well you ought to get it a mate but the bird turned around and bit him he was furious he was so mad at me but yeah he had a picture of my birds
sitting on top of the cage with one tail inside of a front of a cat's face and the tail of another cat walking underneath the cage
so he just loved it he just absolutely adored it
well the one large cat that i still have he took claw marks and put it down my drapes going after the birds sitting out on a
bird rack that we set up outside for birds
going after the birds
and then he'd get down and jump back up on the table and sit next to a cage that had two cockatiels out on top of the cage i'd get so mad at that cat because i didn't realize what he was doing until i saw these big claw marks going down my
drapes from his back claws
yeah i didn't think i didn't appreciate it too much i mean it's rather i thought it was rather funny here's a bird doing this and two birds sitting right next to him but
i mean the birds were out they weren't in the cage they were out i never left them in so but i thought but i still have that cat in fact i have both cats which are my kids' cats but the birds are in here with the cats they don't care
they keep an eye on any cat that walks outside but they don't care about these cats
i don't know what it is i've seen
i've heard a lot of people that doesn't work that way
i mean i've seen that dog my son's dog open up it's mouth and absolutely put it totally around the cat's head
and the
however i do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day and i read the front page of the wall street journal most everyday
so it's no fee subscription i'm very easy to read at my leisure and it's sorted by category for example so i can read certain businesses or topics
but not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things i i'd like to say that however that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media
yeah absolutely after all who writes are people are journalist who are trained to write and they're that's a liberal
an expert in i find their descriptions to be
wrong
and
it
that's right well even if it's not technical if it's social thing or whatever it doesn't matter if i'm expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i'm not expert in that they're telling me lies
one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing that they're showing you
which is sort of like a deliberate bias which is which is rather disturbing i know abc does that
yeah i don't have access either although i did at one time and it i did during the gulf war and it was addictive
the latest and greatest news you could do that by turning on cnn and you
so interesting political trends or events huh
caught his interview last night with david frost and it was the first time i had you know heard you know his views expressed by himself i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in
but the whole phenomena of him coming out of literally no where no party at least no apparent party support on either side
um-hum
like out of nowhere yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum yeah
um-hum
the candidates are already beyond what most public feels is acceptable behavior
you know the one of the common criticisms of clinton is gee he'll say or do anything in order to get to the white house and up unto the point of perot being a serious candidate it seems like that
that was a requirement of being a contender within the party is to have done all those things
i mean here's a here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and preparing himself for the presidency
and now it seems like both he and the incumbent president are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of
a whole nonpolitical arena
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum yeah
and yet even he was a consummate politician in the sense that not only did he fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one
and the first and only election he won was the presidency
yeah then when then when he finally you know did win an election you know was the presidency yeah
but
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
actually they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting because when i went to work for them they didn't do that but since then they've started a
drug testing policy not because of their own convictions but because the clients of our company are requesting that we do that
how about you
uh-huh
hum
okay
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their you know territory and everything but
the thing that's interesting is that i i'm an engineer and a software engineer and i work in the software house and everybody there you know are all software engineers they've never you know they never go out to the oil rigs or anything and
yet we're getting we're subjected to this policy you know the same one that all the engineers have to well a little different actually but you know we have to go through the same thing and it's
but it's a little different i guess than a lot of drug policies in our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you and then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something they give you a drug test right away
other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first particularly like we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol and they didn't find any problem with that you know but
yeah
yeah
yeah it's really it's really bizarre
and i don't know i'm ambivalent about the whole thing i you know i have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if
you know they're they should be able to make it as a condition of employment in some sense and you know it's like you're i mean employments are contractual by nature anyway
but
i had an experience when i was interviewing for a job that where i had to do a drug test and it's it was kind of a long story but it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what i went through and it amounted to
going in before any of these interviews i'm not even working for this company i'm going in for like interviews and they flew me out to chicago and before i went in to any of the interviews they took me to the doctor to give me a physical they said it was going to be a physical you know
and actually beforehand they told me they were going to do drug screening
but i had forgotten about that and so basically i'd already peed off in that morning and
and go in there again and the and the procedure is utterly humiliating you go in there with the doctor he makes you take off all your clothes and then he examines you
well let's see we or i sit down at the
in a on a monthly or a biweekly i get paid every two weeks so i make out a budget for every two weeks and
i sit down and see how much money i have to have for my bills going out
and then i compare that to how much money we need to make and
then just set it up that way and allot this much money for everything and if we have any left over we'll
you know buy clothes or have fun go out to eat or something
and we're going to try to start saving
as soon as we can
we generally don't have a lot left over but as far as the long term our long-term goal is to get out of debt
and
most of our debts are from before we were married and we're trying to get rid of you know student loans those kinds of things
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah that's basically the kinds of bills we have are on our budget are you know the needs the have to haves and
you know those kinds of things we don't have a lot of
let's see my mother-in-law lives not too far from here so she helps with our son's clothes when she can
and
that's real good and
at ti i have a real good benefits package for
you know like for going to the doctor and that kind of thing so that's not something i really have to put in the budget that seriously
so
yeah
really well that's neat
yeah
wow
so what do you do
oh
wow
well that's good that you have the savings to get into
wow
yeah that's
that's the way we are we've had a lot of unexpected things just in the last couple months
that really hit us hard but i've been able to work enough overtime to you know really help with the with covering the expenses
so but we've never been we've been married for nearly four years and we've never been able to save any money and i think it's just
hit both of us just in the past few months that we need to start saving some money no matter what we do we need to put that in our budget and just start doing it
even if it's you know ten dollars a week
and so we're going to start doing that or actually we started two paychecks ago
and that was i think that was a really wise decision
no actually i'm not involved in anything like that at work or
anywhere i don't have anything to fall back on at all
and i know that's not wise but
that's just where we're at right now my wife just went back to work part-time she can substitute teach at schools
and there's so many school districts and schools here in the metroplex that by turning her name in if she wanted to she could work
you know everyday but
we're just going to let her work one maybe two days a week and we're just going to apply all the money that she makes to
our debts and try to get as much out of debt as fast as we can
and there's and we're christians and that's we've only been christians for about five years but that's a real a biblical truth in the bible is to
to not be in debt and we're really starting to see the reasoning behind that
and because we're you know we're always well i can't be sick this week but one day
or you know this month but one day because you know our bills will catch up with us if i am
or you know i we can't go on a two week vacation because
i wouldn't make any overtime in two weeks so that would really hurt us financially and you know just things like that all the time and you know we really see how we're
you know indebted or nearly underneath the debt that we have
you know and that's really hard but
so far we've never really been behind on any bills
i had to put our student loans on hold once for about i think three months
and we had a cutback at work
and this is this was a couple of years back
but anyway but we're doing really good we're not saving but we're staying right even
oh yeah
yeah that's neat
oh that's neat yeah
wow
oh wow because of the time
wow
right
right
wow
yeah my wife made a whole lot of crafts last year for christmas presents
and we didn't
you know have to allot any well hardly very much money anyway for christmas just for our personal family just me and her and our son and
i think her mom and that was really you know about it we made everything else that we gave for christmas last year
and she did really good with that
um-hum
oh wow
wow
oh no
wow
that's funny well anyway what is the economy doing pretty good there where you're at
um-hum
yeah what company is it
oh of e-systems okay
i see what do you all make
oh
it's a concern of yours right now is
are they living independently right now
oh have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that
oh that sounds like the ultimate
well even at that point most care can be given at in the home that sound like just an excellent solution you must feel real good about that
um-hum
right
really in need of a nursing staff right uh-huh
you know listen to is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes it's just a matter of
finding a good home and then of course there is always the problem of being able to able to afford either of those solutions
and that i think is what is scary and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from is when people have to put people in a nursing homes and they really can not afford the best
oh
oh goodness
oh
what a shame they put him in the home so that he could be cared for
and then they could have done that well at home
oh
you hear these stories all the time
you happened
right
oh
right
well good i'm glad they have a solution
to do that yes i know
exactly my
it's just her condition deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home as the situation is so
sad because
it just takes all the dignity away from
from people who have been independent all their lives this was a really neat vital woman
and you get in a nursing home and the first thing that happens you have to share your whole living space with someone that you have never known before in your life
and oh i
i do not know what the answer is but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there and
it i think it does a lot of it goes down to just money
and family support if you know have family that you can live with right
right
i really i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care
you know you'd do your research and you would go visit
and hopefully they would have they would have it so that you could go there anytime
because if you could not go there anytime then that would make you a little bit right
um-hum
my name is ferrell
where are you calling from
miami i'm in utah
yeah
yes it is definitely
sure go ahead
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i have a little bit of a background well my wife taught school for about six years
and i'm almost convinced there's a lot of it has to do with environment
she taught in a poor area poor area here in utah and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the s a t scores
in all the districts of the state
and
the district we're presently living in had like double the scores where she taught and it wasn't because she was a bad teacher or the teachers there were bad i think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the help the kids get from home
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well you know you see these documentaries on japan for example and the rigors they put their students through i mean their high school students are going six days a week
to get into college is no small feat there i mean just to be accepted i'm sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than we do
in essence they have what they call tracks and you know the kids go year round
but you have you go like for eleven weeks and you're off for two or three then you go eleven weeks and so you have these four periods rather than the classic summer vacation
these are just mostly the elementary grades however
uh-huh
oh
regardless of where they live huh
oh
oh that's interesting it's kind of like turning it over to the private sector to some degree
uh-huh
that's an interesting concept
i can't believe it you
uh-huh
yeah their awareness of the of the current events and geography like you were mentioned early
i just find it
it's hard to me to imagine that somebody's going to overwrite what was the largest amount of checks and write out a check for five thousand dollars and not know they're overdrawing their account
but on the other hand somebody you know making a couple of overdrawing checks probably isn't a major phenomena i think they're under a lot of pressure especially when there's lots of money involved
and it's hard to keep them honest when they're there for a long time
well that bothers me because again we ought to have a government where we can choose who we want and when you know limit terms and you say well even if people want this person they can't have them
which is kind of a hard situation too
yes
yeah
well i mean the other problem is that they're always up for reelection
so that they're always not making the right decision but the politically correct decision
and it i think that's hard for them
plus when you put the lobbyist back there i wish somehow we could limit lobbyist
i think that's a greater problem because they're constantly trying to
use their influence in not always the most positive ways
yeah
no
seems to me somehow if they could draw a straight salary and not have any other benefits
and you know i don't know what the salary ought to be but i think that would decrease somewhat the need for the kinds of things that sometimes happen
well i was shocked i was happened to be reading the voters guide in the last election and a representative makes a hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars a year
no thanks
or they give themselves raises when they're trying to cut government expenses
yeah
and the other problem is you know one of the other questions it asked is there someway we can make all unethical things illegal and i'm just convinced you can't legislate common sense
and that seems to be something that a lot of them are missing
and i think part of the other problem is because government has such a bad reputation people who might really do well in it
tend to avoid it
because of all the negative
feelings about politicians you may have some people who could be do a really good job but they just kind of stay out of it because they don't want
to be associated with that kind of thing
yeah i think he definitely is
i don't
i'm just wondering how he would cope with the fact that he can't just do you know sort of looking at the as an outsider at the way he ran his company you either did what he said or you were out
and i'm not sure as a president you could ever run it that
um-hum
a new motherboard
okay
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah
i'm not buying much in terms of consumer products these days
i prefer to travel rather than buy things so
right
exactly yes
right or from the sidewalk vendors that are supposed to be the real thing
oh
uh-huh
you know
i mean if you use the coupon you're just falling for the gimmick and there you are
uh-huh
oh that's right that's right
uh-huh
yeah
oh all those pyramid schemes
yeah
and
right and
even somewhat is mary kay you know she's a local girl
yeah except that i was with a friend yesterday we had his macintosh
and he had taken it back to the store for repair
well whatever but it's what he wants because he's an animator
and he's using all of those tools and he's having a really difficult time with the hardware
oh yeah
um-hum
right
oh exactly and you know
there was no reason that mike should have had to pay forty five dollars for somebody to run a diagnostic that he had already run
and he already knew that it wasn't a software problem
a little bit i have not have not done a lot of fishing in the last couple of years anyway but i like to fish so i i've i take fishing magazines and read and watch fishing tv shows
yeah
yeah
yeah well mine are kids are both grown so that's past the point now where i can use them as an excuse but
working and doing things around the house you know keeps you pretty busy anyway so
yeah
yeah what
yeah when you do fish do you fish for bass or just
yeah
go after the big ones yeah where have you fished recently
yeah
yeah i have not made it to lake fork yet although i've talked about it and
i've got i'm a cpa and i've got clients that or a client that lives on lake tawakoni
that has told me you know anytime i wanna fish you know just come on over
you know i can go fishing just about anywhere i want to go but it's a matter of finding the time you know
just you know whatever you know whatever will bite i'll fish for and my brother-in-law likes to fish for crappie
and so i fish a bit with him you know fishing for those and then you know i fish for bass fish but basically like i said fish for what whatever i can catch
i don't know enough about fishing to you know to say i'm going to go after a particular kind so
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah so are you a
uh-huh
yeah that's
yeah
right on
yeah
yeah well the last time i had anticipated fishing i thought i might fish at lake texoma i was going up there with a group
and
when i got there discovered you have to have a special license to fish on the lake right
yeah
yeah well that's what i understood anyway i discovered it was much better to have texoma license
and i didn't have that so i said well i wasn't going to that plus there wasn't anybody else fishing you know in the group so i said well i just won't worry about it
and that was probably the last time i even tried to fish and or even thought about it but
i've got my fishing tackle in the trunk of my car so if the urge ever
ever bites you know i'm kind of available but
yeah right
but
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
but do you read anything about fishing do you have any books or magazines or anything that you take that you
yeah well i enjoy him too yeah but
yeah i watch i take have just started taking the that bass joined the bass anglers club you know and get their magazine
and then i take the texas fisherman
and you know i find those to be pretty good they the texas fisherman they do cover a pretty broad range of fishing but they cover a lot spend a lot of time on salt water you know
along the coast
yeah
uh-huh
yeah and then of course i guess the bass you know the bass anglers book is covers the pretty well covers the country
so you don't get a lot of texas you know in particular coverage in that but
still you get some pretty good tips
i believe so it's their headquarters are in alabama so
but then they they're always i just joined just signed up for the magazine here a month or so ago but they you know they send you offers and things
lure packages and things like that you can
if you matter of fact if you get other people to sign up you know that to sign up for the thing you know
then you get lure packages or pocket knives or things like that but
but they've got i think they might even have a visa card or something that they promote you know through the club and
they've got discounts on travel rental cars and things like that
yeah
right
yeah
yeah it's a good idea i think i think we need to we need to do a lot more on the conservation than you know
yeah
yeah so you haven't fished joe pool lake down here yet i guess or what's the other one ray roberts is that
yeah
yeah
yeah but yeah i joe pool is so close you know close into dallas it's a little bit of a drive from richardson
to get down there but i've got a couple of clients that are down in that area
i just i just i thought that it might be convenient for me sometime to just
like i said just pull over and fish a while
if i can find a place to get to the water somehow
so you have to find a spot
yeah
yeah
yeah
using a jig and pig i think is the term does that mean that they
like they use just it's like a hook with a little head on it and then just tie a piece of rubber pork type stuff on the hook itself
um-hum
but it's just hung on the hook
yeah huh
um-hum
no and unfortunately it shows i
i'm supposed to i'm way overweight
but i've had a problem with high blood pressure which of course is directly connected to it and my doctor is trying to get my blood pressure under control
before i start in any exercising
so anyway i did join the
the texans
up at
springcreek
and i've been up there a few times
but didn't accomplish too much because i just run down too quick
that would have to be mine i hate exercising it's so boring
i would much prefer to like walk through the woods
uh-huh
isn't it amazing
well we
back when my i have four sons they're all grown now and two of them are married with children of their own but
when they were just pre teenagers we
we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go camping
and we thoroughly enjoyed it i mean we went whole hog we had the tents and everything else and pretty much roughed it
sleeping on the ground and all
and i like to think that my children my sons learned a lot about the outdoors
being self-sustaining
i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and they'd
exist somehow
oh uh-huh okay that is understandable
oh yes i'm very familiar with it very beautiful place
i've been up there several times
oh what a shame
well good i'm glad to hear that about the only thing i might suggest is
do the same thing again introduce her to a to a spider at a reasonable distance where she isn't frightened
and that the nightmare i'm sure was just a freak
i'll bet it wouldn't happen again
sure
with your family
and you're certainly all getting an education while you're
doing this exercise
as far as we're concerned
um-hum
oh definitely it was a learning experience
now we i guess we camped just about every public campground in the state of florida
oh yes yell they used to be but now they're trying to really
put it to the
visitors i think they're doing a very stupid thing
well they charge extra now they there was a time here a few years ago when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the motels and hotels
so they are you know really putting it to the visitors and people got a little fed up with it and they and suddenly the foundling fathers of florida found out that they were losing beaucoup bucks
people were going elsewhere for their vacations
exactly so they got rid of that tax in a hurry
i can appreciate that
um-hum
well the trick is to stop frequently and let the kids get out and run
now i'm alone now myself and i
i have graduated from sleeping on the ground to going in a motor home
well the fact i live in it and there's just my dog and i now my dog is a wonderful traveler but i do have to stop for her quite frequently
and it works out fine i mean i stop i'm never in a hurry to get anywhere
like
it takes me two days to get to memphis
no it's about an eight or nine hour drive really
but i make it in two days because i don't push it
oh definitely oh absolutely incidentally oh i can't remember the name of that place there's a beautiful park up there
and they do have a oh sort of a hotel a lodge a lodge that's what it is
and it's just off the interstate and the kids would love it because they have playgrounds for the children and all and they have a several nature trails
it's just below hot springs
oh
it's lake something
um-hum
well the next time you go across the state line or when you come back in be sure and stop at one of the texas
welcome bureaus
and ask them for their literature on the state national parks in the state of texas
well it there are so many for have you ever been out to tyler state park
all right you
there's a place to take them and
oh good heavens up there just this side of texoma not texoma texarkana
there are three or four state parks up there
and they're all great and again there's the
nature trails
for your exercising
we almost forgot our subject of the day there
but be sure and stop at one of those texas tourist bureaus and get their literature
well it's been my pleasure gina is that with a g
that's italian heritage isn't it
well we needed you know something that was kind of convenient to
to getting you know because usually in the mornings things are pretty rushed
so that was a consideration
my wife and her mother went over to the
to the lady's house who keeps helen
and they you know before took her actually took her over but before
we signed up for it and
just kind of looked around you know and talked to her for awhile
watch how all the children the other children interacted with her and they all seemed to like her so we
we went with her and we've been we've been really happy with her
uh-huh yeah
um-hum yeah
when like when helen gets
a little closer to starting kindergarten that she'd be you know put into a regular
day care so that they can they can learn more
like the alphabet and the numbers and all that stuff although she's really good she
she makes little like handprints
you know helen's hand and then puts little designs on them you know and you know so she takes a pretty active role and
our little girl she was premature and so she had she was on a monitor
heart monitor and that was no problem you know with the with the babysitter she you know took it right in stride
she
um-hum
yeah that's the finding a good one that's the hard part
i think you probably have a better
chance with a day care they're probably
it's more of an average so that there's less chance of having a bad one yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think well i think we're going to keep her where she's at now until she's about three and a half or four and then move her into a regular day care
that has more children
and also where they have like the pre kindergarten
type of environment
she has like occasional help that comes in
uh-huh
personal computers are nice i guess if you can afford them the problem if you happen to use one at work is you tend to get spoiled with the
maybe a higher grade one maybe the economics and the payback of having one at a business is a little bit better than having one at home and i've read a few articles that
where people have nice three eighty six machines and nice graphics and the nice software packages and then when they come home they just can't stand to come down to the x t level and don't like the
the slowness or the in some cases not even having a hard drive and that's pretty much where i fall into i use a relatively nice array of machines at work for scientific purposes and i have
a variety of speeds and complexity of machines depending upon the instrument that it's controlling
and then i have one that i do just general purpose work on and then for the house i don't have anything not that i wouldn't want one but i
would probably not be satisfied with anything less than a really nice one and that's a quite an expense and then all the software tends to be
commercial grade it's all where i guess you know to get something like wordperfect you're looking at five hundred dollars worth or so
and some of the accounting packages or the nicer spreadsheets are somewhat expensive and i don't know it's quite a
expense or a luxury for the house i guess and there's not a whole lot i would do other than some word processing i got a
a number of things that i could be doing on a pc instead of here instead of doing them at the at work they're for the house but i do them on occasion at work and it's nice to it would be nice to have one i guess what do you think
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's good
uh-huh
on your editor do you do does it do spell correcting or any kind of thesaurus work
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
well i tend to that's one thing i notice the speed difference in when i have a darc document that's maybe twenty or thirty pages long and i want to
search through it for the spelling it takes forever on an old x t at four point seven megahertz you know the old ones and we're looking at
several minutes worth of time for it to go through and check everything as opposed to a three eighty six where i can just you know it flashes through there and then even just file copying i do some of that every once in awhile and
and little things like that i i've noticed the speed difference in and i do some graphics i haven't done any well i've done a little bit for the for the house at work but if i were to bring it home
or have a machine at home i would like to be able to put together small brochure type things with the front page being a little bit of graphics and the inside being printed in a
what i would call a booklet form there are some editors that will produce the you know print it sideways and collate it in such a way that this page comes out right so that you can fold all these eight and a half by elevens and make a little booklet and
my i've done that on occasion at work and my wife does some teaching you know little bitty weekend type teaching for some women in the area and
and she likes to work up little outlines and things in this format and so i do all the work for her at work and it would really be nice to be able to do it here and say is this what you want you know instead of going back and forth every day it takes us a little while to get it right
but i don't know maybe someday we'll get around to getting something decent
to bring home
right
uh-huh
yeah unless they're tremendously large they're not going to make that much difference
uh-huh
right
that's interesting i hadn't i hadn't run into anything quite that long or fortunately there
some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care
so it's a very it's a very comfortable i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life
the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people's lives on in a way that you could see one thing that i noticed is it's very convenient to be alcoholic in sweden
because it's treated as a disease now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but
also another thing that i noticed that was very strange i was i would go down all these
i remember this one row of houses and they were row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing well it'd be lower middle-class housing here it's probably
middle-class housing there and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these and there was a doctor that lived in one of these the one guy was a doctor and one was a taxi driver and so
their incomes were about the same
whereas here there's a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward and that didn't exist in sweden
and overall i their health care suffered a fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower and it was it was
less professional and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver type job then a then a doctor type job
right
you don't think it's abnormal
oh i see you're not saying it's right you're just saying it's common
yes
well at my workplace they are we have places for aluminum cans and we have everybody's been issued a separate trash can for
recyclable paper let's see them get that word straight
as far as the community goes it's pretty much voluntary nothing's been done i don't where i live i live in an unincorporated area
and we don't have any we have just private garbage services and
hm
have the garbage police looking after you i guess
well i used to live in california and just before i left they were some communities were making that mandatory and
yeah you know and most people probably don't wanna carry a couple of bags worth of garbage in their car a few miles i mean it's all it's a good idea we should all do it but
if it from a practical viewpoint from a selfish viewpoint if communities made it easy and convenient for you to do it they would have a lot more participation in my opinion
yeah
right
uh-huh
oh
gee you haven't
gee kids around here i don't think would pay well wouldn't pay any attention to it they'd the dogs would get to it before they would i would imagine
wow
oh
is that a city or state law that requires it to be recycled or
well i bet that's resulted in it would seem to me that's resulted in some cleaner highways i would imagine
gee well that's well that you know a state law like that would probably encourage people down here to do it i mean i don't know
well do you do any recycling
yeah
oh
well we there's a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously is aluminum cans
but we've got a we've got a couple of different things places they're like unattended
and when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot
sure
okay
okay
no you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that
oh okay no they don't charge us that extra nickel
yeah it really is really what happens is we just get a penny a can back
off the off the price if you wanna think of it that way so when we get like a twelve pack then that's like twelve cents back
yeah
yeah everybody does newspapers
yeah
i tell you what really works at least down here is if there is if there is some even some money basically to take care of the gas
to recycle it you know what i mean then people tend to do it
in other words taking care of the environment is all well and good
but if it's gonna cost you to take care of the environment they're not quite as likely to do it as if as if you get something back for it
you know and so you know if there are some energy savings or if there's some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer
you know it kind of reminds me of using an atm card
you know to get money or doing your banking you know if it's free people will use it if it costs them something then they're not as likely to use it
you know
but i know we had a problem down here with oil people taking oil out of their cars
and just putting it down the you know the drain sewer
and all that because there was apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil they just dump all the their old oil down there now they're starting to recycle that stuff
yeah
yeah
yeah i know the a lot of places they
i have several outside shrubs that i maintain take care of
yeah i certainly do i planted a rosebed last year
and they came out looking really nice lot of red and white ones pink
yeah i'm in plano
yeah i've got a well my roses are on the west side of the house i asked my neighbors what they wanted to see outside their front door
um-hum
yeah and i still need to assess the damage outside from the freeze this winter
yeah the trees are all doing really well i've got a nice japanese maple out front that
looking really nice right now
uh-huh
yeah
yeah every year there's some freeze damage and i lose different variety of shrubs
have to go replace them with something a little hardier
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah i don't do much with flowers myself i just get a lot of evergreen type shrubs some
some dwarf burford hollies and yaupon hollies
they do very well um-hum
yeah they make a nice hedge
and the nice thing about those types of hollies is you don't have to trim them into a boxy type hedge
you can just let them grow their natural shape
oh yeah oh i've got some chinese hollies that are just outrageous
they are very sharp
do you do your own lawn maintenance or do you hire somebody to do that
yeah i do that myself too i too really don't appreciate them calling me up all the time to try to push their services on me
because i've got a very small yard the entire size of the lot is only forty five by ninety feet
it's what they call low maintenance yard and these maintenance companies call up wanting to
put the weed killer and the fertilizer down and they want they want to charge forty or forty five dollars per application for my size yard i don't spend that much in a year
uh-huh
it doesn't take much work
huh
uh-huh
yeah i've got a little electric mower and i will never buy another one of those again
it's fine for my size yard but it really doesn't have the power of a gas motor
um-hum
it's better for a large yard
yeah
before i moved down here when i was up north in wisconsin living with my folks they lived on three and a half acres of land and we started mowing that with a push mower
it still took a few hours even with the riding mower
not nearly as much as here
i think it's probably because we lived out in the country somewhat and there just wasn't the emphasis on keeping the yards looking real nice
yeah a lot of people do but then again there are a lot who do nothing
my street is
kind of in between there are a couple of neighbors who are really good about planting flowers and trees
but there the majority really haven't done anything with their yards this neighborhood is four years old
and you would think that in that time they'd get their lawns and gardens established
um-hum
yeah i'd like to see the neighbors put some trees in the front yards anyway just to get something started
right
you'd think that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree
it's nice when the builders plant trees for you when they build the house
no my builder was gemcraft and they didn't put trees in at all
yeah
the trouble with builders planting the trees is they get the weaker varieties ones that aren't as desirable
and those include arizona ash and in some cases silver maples
yeah that's probably true i've got a live oak in front i really like the oaks a lot
they're very hardy for this area
um-hum
oh i had a red oak a few years ago that i bought from
and the other reason was that i bought it in spring and it was a balled and bur lapped tree right before summer the heat of summer it couldn't take the heat and it died
yeah i usually go to callaway's or wolfe
callaway's tends to have nicer shrubs more fully developed
and i don't think there's a problem with the warranty on any of those places although they have cut back on their warranty for the shrubs the past couple of years
yeah
really well that's good for trees i don't think they do that for shrubs
i think it's still a year or less for shrubs
oh it's never too late to plant something unless well for trees if they're balled and bur lapped it's recommended to plant them in the fall or winter
but for just shrubs say five gallon or one gallon shrubs any time of the year is fine
right just have to take care of them and water them so they get established put some
right some stimulator down
so yeah it's never a problem to plant things in the summer
i'm just waiting for a sale
they haven't really had any good sales on plants yet
so
you have to watch the like the crepe myrtles
because they'll look really bad like they're dead
and all of a sudden they'll bud out
i've got several crepe myrtles that look just awful
and there are buds coming out all over the place now
i have a crepe myrtle tree in the backyard that still hasn't done anything and i'm kind of wondering what kind of shape it's in right now
they can
right they can get out of control
but mine keep dying back down to the ground so i haven't had that problem yet
but i do have some really nice boston ivy on the west side of the house
grows on the on the brick
on the house itself
that you have to really watch to keep it under control because they will take over a house if you don't tend to it
those things grow about an inch a day
