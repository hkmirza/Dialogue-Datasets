alright what do you think
right
hum okay well i mean also along the same lines i know that there's somebody i read one time about somebody's developed a test to look at the emissions from your car
you know you know i just don't i mean everybody's so concerned right now about recycling and everything i think that's pulled away from the focus of air pollution
yeah i hadn't heard anything about that
you know and you can i mean i'd go behind somebody the other day and you mean you saw this huge amount of smoke pouring out the back of their car and you had to change lanes to get away from them
you know and i mean if you can see it and smell it that badly on that vehicle think about how many others are pouring out that you can't see and smell
that's right
that's right
that's
well i know in dallas i'm i live pretty close to downtown to dallas and you know and there are days you just you open the door and just go huh i'm not leaving here today you know
and i mean there's a place that used to be called concrete city and they have all these things where they used to burn and what they would burn off would be lead
and now you know i mean here they've been spewing this stuff out for forty years or more and they're just now beginning to figure out that you know that what they've done is wrong
you know and now we're trying to clean that up but you know we've seen the visible effects in the soil but it makes me wonder what kind of effects that it's had on the atmosphere that we don't know yet
you know and so many of these things takes so many years to develop that we've never you know it'll be past my life time before i see the effects of some of the things that we're doing now
so
um-hum
right
yeah i pushed in
so how do you use your credit cards
um-hum
yeah that's me i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee
you know and i'm like you i use it
well to buy my gas with my shell credit card i use that
and then like my emporium card and
weinstocks card i use that but i'm like you i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill why i don't just write a check i don't know
you know it's just really weird but i don't carry a lot of cash with me because i'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse
yeah you know enough for a phone call and that's about all
but
other than that that's the that's the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they can't charge any more
you know and i think that's terrible
oh yeah
yeah because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit why
it really does help
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket
they're going to hit you over the head
so i just don't i don't carry money i'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know
right
yeah
yeah right
yeah right
and you know some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything
you know i don't know why they don't unless you have to spend a certain i don't know but i notice that some of them don't even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you
you know so i don't think that's right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know
uh-huh
well let's see what else can i say about credit cards
yeah i don't i don't that that's that sears discovery card is that what that
yeah now i don't have that one you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i see
uh-huh
i see
yeah well i'll
so do you keep a monthly budget or anything like that oh yeah
oh
so you keep record of all the checks you write and all the credit card
uh-huh
how do you categorize these things that's what always sort of stumped me when i sat down to do it right huh
okay
okay so this insures that you know what your bills are and that they get paid
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay so that insures that the bills get paid before other things get paid for now do you uh-huh go ahead
uh-huh
okay and what happens then when you don't
oh okay
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah so do you do anything about you know saying hey i'm willing to spend this much a month on food and this much a month on
clothing or
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
so is food in that list also and so you have a certain amount you spend on
groceries that you expect to spend for each month
okay and things like now some expenses come up you know twice a year or once a year like insurance
uh-huh
uh-huh
so you have an entry for each month for those things
uh-huh
uh-huh
and so you i mean each month before that do you put away you know one tenth one twelfth of it or
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh so now what about the long term considerations like retirement and college and stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that sounds great
so now what exactly in an annuity i've always found those a little confusing
okay
okay now do you pay taxes on the interest
okay only when you draw it out
okay
uh-huh
okay now i guess the question is it better than an
hi phil
pretty good how many children did you say you had
wow you have three children boys girls
wow
so you don't get a chance to spend much time with him then until when he comes home
where i had a lot of things that i thought that i needed to do that were more important than spending time with my children in fact when they were younger i was attending school
and then i found myself short of cash so i also went in for a part-time job so by the time that i got home after my second job
you know it took away a lot of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast that
that i didn't really enjoy it as much as i could have if i worked at it a little harder
it's unbelievable how fast you know when you get to the point where even your kid's age they don't want to spend time with you anymore and you know i
uh-huh
well camping is one thing that i could never get used to i used to take the kids to go fishing and things like that but i never went never went camping
yeah
yeah up in new england it's
you know three or four or five months tops after that you're in the house
well i can think of some enjoyable things that i did with the kids like we used to go up to new hampshire quite a bit and go to the white mountains area and visit all the you know the nature trails and things like that
uh-huh
you attend a lot of their games
uh-huh
did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons
uh-huh
yeah i felt that myself as i as i grew older my child grew older that i realized that i didn't spend half as much time with my daughter as i did my sons because i'd want to do the things that i thought
that they would like to do and it would always be the things that i wanted to do without realizing it you know things like you know fishing and doing things outside and my daughter didn't like doing those things so she ended up spending more time with her mother than
than with myself and i think she's closer to her mother today than she is to me because of that
yeah it's unfortunate because yeah you know even though you think of them as a whole family when you do things sometimes you separate them without even realizing it
and she'd always say well i want to go to my girlfriend's house or i want to stay home and do this or she had like little projects she was working on at home and things like that
so i kind of missed that i my daughter especially being with her
no she's the second oldest she's twenty three now
personality traits and things like that no i can't say that i have
uh-huh
the youngest one is more sensitive that's same with my family and it's strange
but if i say the wrong thing to my youngest son he will he won't cry anymore because he's too old but he gets hurt he bruises very easily and i can feel that
yeah
i remember when i first took my kids out fishing and again i was with my two sons and not with my daughter but no i was with my oldest son my youngest son wasn't old enough or i didn't think he was old enough to take out and
we caught this fish it was it was a fairly large size fish and he was very proud it of he put it on the backseat on the floor and it was waggling around and we came home and he
and
yeah well it was his first fish he didn't he didn't want to hide it he wanted everybody
you know and we need you know better health insurance and you know
okay
okay
well right now i'm just a student i only work part time but i i've work in the job force before and
forty hours is just too long you just don't have any time to do anything it seems like
saturday you get off but sunday you're getting ready for monday
and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well that'd happen is that for every four people we'd give another job
and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that would make a bigger market we'd have
more recreation people would have time to do it there'd be less of a stress level we'd have we'd have less crime we'd have to we'd have to build less prisons we'd you know less police force
it that's a that's a possibility one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance
is that the small businesses can't offer us health insurance
and it it's too costly and then what is happening is that they're on
a policy where they have x amount of users in it okay and so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and
and things like that
what and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular it's called a group well what'll what happens then is that
they cancel because they just can't cancel the indivigal
so that they have to cancel is just like life insurance they have to cancel everything
so what they do is that they cancel the insurance and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage
but i'm you know i'm satisfied with my job i'm an engineering student and i work for my instructor and i'm
i'm not a typical student i'm older i'm in my thirties okay and so i have a lot of job experience and
my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the in the same token
it's a really enjoyable for me because i don't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and
one of the things that i really hate about jobs i don't i don't like bosses that you know wanna
yell at you and you know and are down your back and all this and that i just really can't deal with that so
what kind of what kind of jobs have you done
uh-huh
yeah that's great you have what you might call knowledge power you know when you work at a company
whether you know it or not is that you're categorized some people can be let go and replaced like say a typist somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone a receptionist
but if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system well then you're vital to the company and you get more of the benefits so
that's where i'm i like i'm into computers too and that's one of the things that i've found in any one of these jobs and anything i've done
is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge you're not gonna you know be let go you know be one of the last ones to let go anyway
but what i
i'm concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden
they're very large
and they could become very quickly a large financial burden as one more stepchild we have to carry around
and they have a problem their whole attitude
i i'm not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it
and the people in the city were saying well why should i go do that make the government do that that's not my job
absolutely
and i think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you cannot go back people only go forward
and i think that is giving them i'm expecting a call and unfortunately i think it's come through i've enjoyed talking to you thank you bye
as texas el paso they were undefeated until thursday night when they played the university of utah here in salt lake city and
they were beaten by a last minute three point shot
and so it kind of opened things up a little bit they play brigham young university tonight
and i i'm pretty sure they really got a good team this year and i
yes they do they usually they're usually the one or two in the in the wac conference and they're the only team from texas
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah who's doing the who's leading the conference
i see
oh
that kind of fouled things up plus maybe
um-hum
right well last year the university of utah went and they had two of their stars
got hurt the beginning of the season this year and that's why texas el paso is in the university of utah went to the nc double a's last year and got into the final sixteen i guess but
utep like i say is doing real well and it's too bad that they have something like that did they restrict the
the longhorns as far as being able to play in any of the
junior college so it didn't affect their program other than loosing him yeah right that's too bad
yeah but
oh that's too bad
um-hum
i see
um-hum
good i know i was in montana this last week and i saw the
huh the women's team from texas was playing penn state
and penn state was ranked number eight i believe in the women's basketball and i got to watch the half and then i had to leave on a flight back to utah and i texas was leading
i don't know how they came out i don't know if you heard or not but
yeah
um-hum
i wish them well
that's great
i'll say
yeah that's
last year the university of utah that was the best season they'd had and the well the coach had come in this rick majerus he'd come in he'd only been there a couple years and
really built the program and they were supposed to well they were rated up in the first top ten this year until they lost their two of their star players and through injuries
hitting and
right now we i've got a four year old subaru and a two year old honda
oh goodness
really
um-hum
uh-huh
i bet i bet
um-hum
no
um-hum
um-hum
really rugged gm cars
you know as far as durability so we kind of
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
it's like a yacht
yeah what we sold our we traded in our le sabre for our subaru
yeah it was a great car it just we ran the wheels right off of it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hm
um-hum
um-hum
it's a nice car
oh around sixty thousand miles on them we drive a lot
um-hum
um-hum
a pickup
um-hum
um-hum
really
um-hum
i think that'd be a good idea
we've kind of been the types that will say this is what we intend to spend this is the car we want will you sell me this car for that price
and we've had we with our when we bought our subaru the guy was like you can't do this to me and we were just like okay fine we won't then you know and he's like no but
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
goodness
that's right
yeah
pens
boy they they're tugging on a few strings at once aren't they
yeah
yeah i got some call last night i'm trying to remember oh this was like this is kind of an invasion of privacy where
i went to a wedding expo because i'm getting married and there are like you know these places where they say you know sign up for a free whatever you know for a drawing
and you do it and you know all of a sudden this guy is calling you and saying hi we want to call you know talk about video taping your wedding when shall we set a time up and i couldn't get the guy to get off the phone
it's like how many at what part of no didn't you understand you know
yeah same here
family right
right
-eah
i think in general you know technology as nice as it is causing a lot it's just too easy now to it's like you know bay banks used to be you know you could do anything over the phone
you had to know your pin number but i could i could just say to it empty my whole account out if i wanted transfer things
and you know there there's a lot of risk involved there because you know it it's like you know the best example is probably credit reports now
where you know god knows what goes on those things i mean thankfully now you can get your reports for free at least from trw
you know and then you find out you can go for a house or something all of a sudden you find out what all these people have been you know dumping information about you in there and i've heard of cases where it was just done vindictively
yeah
yeah
yeah when i when i applied for my gold mastercard they said well you have to close this other mastercard out too and i said you mean the one i closed two years ago
and i had to get a letter from this other company saying that i had closed it
yeah
how you know you're permitting them to do credit checks of you and to make your information available to other people and by the time you get through reading it you've basically permitted them to you know broadcast on the evening news your credit rating
right
well you know there's much more subtle kinds of invasions of like every time you call an eight hundred number you're giving them your phone number
yeah we're we both probably signed up for this in the same place
a n i yeah but to some extent i'm not as worried about that because yeah you're getting a value for that you're getting to call these people for free
um-hum
yeah
okay national service what do you think about it i'm sorry i forgot your name already
lee okay lee
um-hum
um-hum
hum
well think of how much we have to pay for it i i'm you know i think if it's voluntary you get the people that want to be there
they'll do well if it's mandatory you get everybody you get people that don't want to don't want to do work like that and they'll goof off or sell drugs to their coworkers or something like that
hum
yeah i'm
well think of it yeah i but i wonder about that the mere fact that it isn't cost effective do you think that if it's not cost effective do you think that people are going to be enthused about it
hum
kids turning eighteen every year i think it's about that might be a little bit lower now but
that's an awful lot to bring into a program you got to have eight million jobs available you've got to have administrators for eight million jobs that would be tremendously expensive
not you know not to forget the cost of putting all of those kids in non market
enterprises for a couple of years that's going to delay their entry into the work force delay the time when they can begin paying taxes too so the impact is going to be double there i
just don't see
no
i don't know i
yeah i grant to that but if that's the case then it needn't then you don't have a you don't need a mandatory program to bring everybody into national service
you just need a program for the people that haven't gotten anything better to do and i think that might be a good idea although again then you get the kind of people who are likely to sell drugs to their coworkers et cetera
right
that's true but i think that was different in at least three respects first of all
it was not a mandatory program if you didn't have another job you could join it you were not required to but it was a way to get a paycheck so people did join it
secondly the time of the depression was just vastly different people were not as cynical about society about government and about the nation as they are now so they didn't react negatively as many people would today
and thirdly the economic conditions were different it was a big drain on the treasury during the depression as well it's not clear that it made it any easier to get out of the depression
i've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening and i thought well i'm not having any luck i'll try the middle of the afternoon
i am too well do you have any opinion on the subject
hm
oh
or a population or anything i'm really uninformed
um-hum
um-hum
right i thought they were
so they have a probably really fight to keep it in if they could
no they don't
foodwise or any wise sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon or not that would do any good but i guess people do that when they're desperate
well that's true since the depression i guess when the veterans went to washington
and well you know with war riots of course
well we do we have lots and lots of layoffs here lot of companies folding lot of layoffs and it's pretty scary
and so i assume that has some effect
or a great effect and i do i mean they said during the reagan bush years the rich got richer the poor got poorer the statistics prove that
of course if somebody in china can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions well i don't know what's gonna happen then
and child labor right well i don't know what do you think has caused our horrible situation
one thing
right well they say too that having a democratic congress
and republican president is not good the i mean i've read that is a theory
oh i know it used to right well you don't run too many democrats anymore for a while i kind of deserted the party but
now it's looking better to me
oh do you oh i'm glad to hear that well i think so too i just admire her a lot
and i really hope she does well but she's
he shot himself in the foot so many times oh how did you get on this ti thing
oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my daughter that's seventeen now
i worked even when she was a baby
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a methodist day school at preston hollow methodist
right off of walnut hill and preston and it was a wonderful environment i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place
so it worked well how about you
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the churches have really strong
preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown dallas
and what i liked about preston hollow is that
the people that were there when cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there
so it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and
real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i'm really glad my kids had it because plano schools do so little of that
that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff
uh-huh
or pay for it after school our emily's in the third grade over at huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take french and music and art and
you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools
rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah
well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the day schools do serve those purposes
uh-huh
uh-huh
until they were two yeah both times they were at our house
yeah
well no she didn't live with us the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money
so that was a plus from that respect as well and then with emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so
i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center
um-hum
um-hum
yeah oh that would be hard
well they give a lot more leave i work at ncnb now and our benefits for maternal and parental care and even for elderly people or
are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time
for up to six months it's really neat i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint
we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i've of course it's too late for me so i've not tried them to see how effective they are but
i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
and for our age group it's too late too little too late
uh-huh
right yeah
oh sure
you retain employees and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our employee assistance programs that
they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces
so i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well in plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in plano area
and i kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move she ended up being in a different home every year
and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i tried kindercare and then she's old enough to
yeah
right
um-hum
right
what i mean hobbies do you enjoy
do you have a lot of spare time to do it in or is it something you kind of have to make time for
um-hum
um-hum
sometimes
yeah well i enjoy needlepoint although boy i guess i got myself burned out i did too much too fast and
for some reason my eyes aren't quite what they used to be either
and
yeah i am but i don't know it's just
maybe it's the light but
and
i enjoy photography as a hobby
and bowling and right now my biggest hobby i guess since you know recovering is
watching television and playing nintendo with my son
and i do enjoy reading
i do read a lot read quite a lot
i enjoy reading different types of things
i enjoy reading novels
then you know
today is his birthday yeah
six
do they live close by
my sister's going to have a baby this summer
so but i guess that's a little off the subject
i don't know i've tried various things i've tried to get interested in things like refinishing furniture woodworking or ceramics but it just seems like
it's so expensive to break into something new
that you know with my i've got enough of an investment in my photography equipment
that
um-hum
oh yeah
are you doing that yourself
how do you do it
you don't have to
i mean is the something that you don't have to see it as you it's not like your
um-hum
um-hum
oh okay that's what i wondered
do they make good quality copies do you think
um-hum
yeah
oh
well that's nice
yeah i remember those we've never had one my parents never had one but
oh
that's my dream i guess is to have my own darkroom
yeah
they're expensive to maintain just the chemicals are expensive
yeah i would still like black and white
to me black and white is photography color is more snapshot
yeah you really can people don't realize that
not realize that black and white it nowadays it's actually more expensive than color
yeah
and i well i used to i learned how to knit when i was little my grandmother knitted a lot
and she knitted all the time
and before she passed away and made some beautiful things but i've never really learned how to do more than the basic
um-hum
when's the baby due
time to get busy do you know if it's going to be a boy or a girl
i don't know
is it her first one
well
yeah
that's something i've
it's interesting to me people who watch people who are that know how to paint i just felt like that's something i've never been very good at or very good at drawing or anything
i've watched i've yeah here and there but they make it i know that
um-hum
yeah
yeah i've yeah and i know a girl that used to do it and hers did too but i just don't think see myself whipping out masterpieces in thirty minutes
like they do on the shows
do you enjoy cooking
i like to cook but i've really gotten away from it it's with just two my son and myself it's just not
to me it's just
he you know i hate you know hate to admit this but we live on frozen food
yeah they have
yeah i like gardening that's of course that's something i can't do with my back
and my back
yeah
my dad's grew up on a farm and he always had gardens and we always had fresh vegetables which i just really like and
oh you have to do it oh gosh
do you garden vegetables or flowers or both or mostly vegetables
yeah there's nothing like fresh vegetables picked out of the garden
but
well it's been nice talking to you
he knows today after the little something today because he knows it's his birthday to make it special but
well you have a nice day okay bye-bye
ready
social changes
well whatever i guess you want to whether things changed over the last twenty years
all right good enough here we go
well let's see i guess some of the some of the things civil rights have come a long way i guess in the last twenty years
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah and i guess i guess women's rights have come with that too i guess so that's
probably not
um-hum
yeah
yeah
that's true
yeah
okay that twenty five years ago that japan wasn't what it is now so that that's probably caused some changes
um-hum
oh yeah like the old subarus and the old datsuns
um-hum
no we don't as a matter of fact
but what else what else has changed oh i guess watergate was in there so i guess politics in general has kind of kind of gone downhill
in the last because i can remember maybe before nixon that
the presidents were really up on a pedestal
yeah
um-hum
yeah
no i there's no easy answer that's for sure or else they would've done something by now i guess
but
and probably the only other thing i can think of in the last oh twenty years or so i guess is that family structures have changed a lot
um-hum that's true
yeah
yeah it doesn't seem the norm to have parents and the two what two point five kids and all that
yeah
true
yeah
but it it's sad that we're losing the grandparents and the uncles that you know beyond that families don't seem to get close anymore
and that's probably got something to do with what you're saying about the migratory
yeah
yeah
i think you're right i think that's very rare anymore that definitely people aren't at family reunions on a regular basis and a lot of them i guess don't do it at all so
because i know it's been a long time since our family ever did anything like that so
that's true
um-hum
yeah i mean not
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum overpower them
well it's probably because it lasted so long you know i guess it's
yeah
um-hum
um-hum yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
more of a
more information processing yeah
um-hum
yeah
no that's true that's true over the last twenty years that's a definite change and it's only going to only going to get worse i guess in the near future
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
or electrical engineering probably yeah
um-hum
oh okay
oh
uh-huh
yeah
sure you ready
okay
well it won't be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to retire and when we retire we're going to buy us a you know a new one and get rid of the two that we have right now
i do i don't know we're either gonna buy a pick up or we're gonna buy a van
or we're gonna buy an economy car how do you like that
yeah
yeah it sure does i really would like to have something like that and i'm hoping that by you know
that's like right now my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now
but i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because i'm hoping they'll get so many better features
well just like that air bag i think that thing is fantastic cause i've seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things where they had it
and people walk away from it we had one here i guess it was about three weeks ago and the people walked away from the wreck with no scratches nothing you know a few bruises
um-hum
uh-huh
you got it i
i tell you what i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door
well you know what the average person would you ever have thought of that
i mean now
you probably would not
right
because you always think i mean i don't know maybe you don't but just like me
i always think well you know these things must be safe but that's just like i don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist
all these people were and it was on one of those kind of shows like 20/20 these people were like paralyzed and because it threw them forward but they were hooked at the waist and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord
then they were like paraplegics
right
yeah
well tell me about your van do you like it
um-hum
huh the reason that we're thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to florida
and like i said i mean we're not that old but my husband works for the state and after a certain amount of years you can retire
uh-huh and we wanted to travel well that was really nice traveling but you know i like to know more
i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know and see what they think of them the different kinds because i've only ridden in the one that's it
shoot i can't even think of the name of it now
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well now this one that we went in it did baby what kind of van was that we went to florida in
a what
a ford what you remember
he was trying to think of what the name of it was
this was a big one i mean it was a big one it had the it had the front and the back and you know it has the backseat let down into a double i mean a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then
the two swivel chairs on the front
and i mean it was fantastic and it got good gas mileage but
i don't know i don't really
i don't i want something i can drive too you know and i was scared to drive that big van
well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror i mean not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was
yeah does yours do that too oh i was wondering if all vans did that
uh-huh
yeah well see that's the reason that we couldn't make really make them at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it but then that gas mileage was just atrocious i mean it's unreal it's
you just practically don't get any
yeah and then he talked about a van and i said well you know i don't know i don't know how the gas is on most of these
and another thing was that's the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along
when we went somewhere but really and truly the safety features but i wouldn't get one that if it had the seat belts on the door now i wouldn't get it period
oh that would be good
oh i think so too i don't think they should do away with the seat belts now i'm but i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist but i think you need that bag to pop out too
you know because i know so many people
here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had they had that air bag they may still be walking around
but i think it's fantastic i wish they required it in everything every new car that came out i wish they would require it in it
yeah
well no because what they would do is that's what they're going to plan on you know they would have to do it the insurance company would have to do the same thing they're given like a ten year time limit
where okay these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years
and then you know if you didn't have a car that had one in it then your insurance would go up enormously
oh that's okay
okay
well you too
well do you have any children or are you in college
certainly and where did your children go to college
well that's great
i see
well that's great i'm the director of admissions at utd
well
well you're going right down my list the first thing that i always talk to students about is the academic program because if we don't have what you're looking for it isn't gonna do you any good no matter how bad you wanna come here
and cost is always usually next on the list especially for the parents and financial assistance and scholarships
and usually then we talk a little bit about the size of the school and different types of organizations and activities that they can get involved in and of course distance from home and size of classes and
it sounds like from your experience you know how to go right down the list with them
yeah you know it's interesting especially when my experience has always been at a public university
and a lot of the students in that home town sometimes shun the idea of staying and going to school across the street so to speak
but it always seems like at the beginning of the year they're talking about well i'm going to this state and i'm getting out of here and i'm going way over there
sure
i have a daughter that's a seventh grader and then i have a son that's a sophomore at shepton high school
and so it's been interesting watching them sign up for appropriate course work and things and they're on the college bound track at least
well they certainly have two different personalities but in terms of needs the older son is interested in the medical field
and at this particular point you know taking appropriate course work but really nothing that's in out of the ordinary
and the daughter has indicated that she wants to get a degree in
hi how you doing
uh-huh
yeah i have what i've found out of curiosity was my name has come up twice and we've only been involved with the program say about a year
and when i when i first heard about it i was very defensive i didn't think it was something that the companies ought to be doing
because i felt that i was losing something or taking something away from me
yeah but now that it's happening i
i feel comfortable with it i don't feel as though i've lost anything and that i feel secure in that i know that everybody that works
around me
is drug free
how about how about where
um-hum
well i was involved in the in the initial training program because i had to go out and teach or explain to other people
what we were doing why we were doing it so i guess i had a little first hand knowledge of
of seeing the films i had more of extensive training in background information of the reasons why they were doing it the cost that
that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people be involved with drugs
oh yeah
how do you feel about other things like public safety buses bus drivers and airplane drivers or
pilots rather
you
yeah
yeah
well i
yeah the i've always felt that public people who are involved with the safety of other people should be drug tested i've i never said that i didn't want that the problem that i had was
whether my coworker is on drugs or not has does not have an influence on my safe well-being
no so i had
right
you know i've gone to those classes unfortunately for me i'm a smoker and i saw the statistics that came out on
smokers typically have more time out of work they're more prone to accidents and all of those other things and
for automobile insurance i had no idea
that they were doing that i know that they originally talking about health
uh-huh
you're not as attentive
that's different i've never heard of that how about the
the smoking premium
out in texas i understand they started doing that
june july
yeah that they from what i understand that notices went out to all of the sites
yeah
well that's the problem that's you don't how about do you do you like french fries
then you would get upset it's what they're doing is they're nibbling at the population piece by piece
and now they know that the number or percentage of smokers is less than the people who do not smoke then they can go ahead and do that
preventable death not yeah but
yeah but isn't the insurance also for blue cross
so they're not only saying not preventable death they're also saying
that you'll have less likelihood of being sick if you don't smoke
uh-huh
is he an older person
well that
that's not too old
yeah and he and he does miss a lot of work
yeah
yeah
well
what do you mean if they can prove it there there's already
see one of the things that will determine whether they're able to do that or not is not their ability to prove that it is unhealthy because we all know that french fries are not healthy for you it's the it's the capability of detecting it
but i think in time come you're going to see that happening you're going to see where the high risk people pay a premium but they have to find a way to prove it
yeah
but yeah but there are more drinkers than smokers if you think about it
and drinking is still socially acceptable where smoking is socially unacceptable today and so that there's a big difference so that so that they really can't make a change in policy about drinking until
so i guess you can you can classify alcohol as a drug so is a cigarette in my opinion where it's not i don't think people that are that are smoking are doing it voluntarily i think they're doing it involuntarily
i know i am i don't know anybody in their right mind that says that i'm doing it because i want to i
well i do i do make that statement i say i do it because i like it but i can't say i'm doing it because i want to i'm doing it because i have to or my desire is greater than
uh-huh
start up again
i started when i was younger and
it was prior to the time that the risks were known
okay nice talking to you
i'm in the
attleboro massachusetts plant
yeah
oh no kidding
well i several years ago a radio broke in my car and i never i got out of the habit of listening to the radio and so
too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they're in the news or something but so i tend to listen to some of the older
songs that were popular back when i was paying attention and then i like some classical music and some of the
pieces that have been around a while i haven't paid much attention to most of the current music what about you
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
that's true
um-hum
no
uh-huh
music to listen to but and i back a long time ago when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty and i listened to some of it but i you know now that there's just a million rap groups and
and they try to tend to try to do outdo each other with raciness i think and
so i you know i'm not attracted to that at all but it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was a easy access and so now that i do have one i just don't automatically turn it on
unless there's something i'm particularly listening to but you know if you go two or three years without having that what i got the most exposure to
it really changed my lifestyle and kept me from
just having a you know easy access to current music and so i did like i say tend to go back to
albums and cassettes and things that i had already had purchased but we don't have a cd yet do you
uh-huh
yeah i kind of decided to wait until it was around a while it was kind of like remember when personal calculators first came out and they were really expensive and then now you can get one for two or three dollars
uh-huh
sure and also they get better quality and they learn to have more features and things and without and making them less expensive so we're kind of waiting
to like now you know and the price of cassettes has gone down because cds are so popular so
i haven't even priced them i guess they must be
uh-huh
take our time well i can't imagine you can't record on them and so
they won't be as functional as like a cassette player where if you heard something
you could record it you know if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that you'd heard or that you owned an album of so cds won't be nearly as handy
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's good
um-hum
why we haven't either but we you know we like the
the idea of having great extra quality you know in your music and things but i'm satisfied to just have what i've been used to not have to think about the great financial
sacrifice that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all cds or something but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is
when we had children i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching and what kind of music i was listening to and activities because you know i just didn't want them to be exposed to
a lot of things and a lot of the lot of the songs have some lyrics that i just wasn't pleased with you know
um-hum and so i really think we've tried to tone down
our taste there to make you know our children not be exposed to so many negative things so early in life
um-hum
uh-huh
right
right
yes i know what you mean i know my husband he
plays an instrument and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music and he goes out of his way to play marching band music or
like you say jazz or classical to the children to give them some exposure to different kinds of music and i think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds and
he plays the it's a euphonium it's like a small
a really small not a tuba but
i it's hard to explain i never had known anyone to play one before but it's kind of like a small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder
but it's a cross between a tuba and an and you know a horn it's a brass instrument
so he plays that and a little bit of piano and
but he has some real fond memories of marching band and
concert band type
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
okay i guess probably the first thing we could start off with is
uh-huh
um-hum
right
i just recently retired from the army and so when we moved to this area here i got selected for jury duty as did my wife and it was an interesting experience i'd never done it before and
this was all civil
although i did have a chance at a criminal one they actually had to interview like about a hundred and fifty people
get together a jury because there had been so much publicity about it but i was not selected for that one i would have been interesting i think
that's a hard question
right um-hum
right
um-hum
right and it meant um-hum
right
course you're as a juror to you're
you're really at the mercy of the lawyers
because you don't know what really went on
and you can never depend on anybody telling the truth
and you're kind of at the mercy of the various lawyers who are
examining and cross examining the witnesses and they're
so it's really tough and one of the things when i was on the jury that bothered me was the fact that i was holding in my hands possibly the life of that individual
and when you got right down to it
you i really never knew who was really telling the truth and who wasn't
you can't you can't go by what the lawyer is saying pretty much and you don't know if the witnesses are being truthful even though they are sworn to tell the truth
the trial was stupid these people were supposedly adults you'd think they could have worked their problems out
we had to sit there and listen to all the dumb things that they did and i felt sometimes like saying why don't you people just
you're supposed to be adults why don't you get with the program and work out your problems instead of having to go through all this in front of a jury it just seemed it just seemed dumb at the time
right
it's an awful responsibility but it's like voting and all the other things that we're responsible for it's
one of those things you have to do i guess
right
uh-huh
right
um-hum
yeah that was a lot of money
um-hum
right
well yeah what the value would be equal to today
yeah
um-hum yeah
right
uh-huh
hm
um-hum
the
right
first one that i had was a drug case
okay
i wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i'm getting ready to go to work
oh i
quite frequently glance through headlines or in the newspaper
but primarily mine is tv news
how about yourself
true
uh-huh
well that's true but i
trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military
now i can appreciate that especially after what happened in vietnam
but
i mean let's face it today's means of communications we could very well a newscaster could very well give away a
piece of top secret information
and
pat himself on the back for
making a big scoop
of course t news is more or less headlines i don't think much of their sports coverage
all they give the scores
but that's right i'm not
yeah outside of pro football i'm not too interested in other sports anyway
but the t news is a good way to keep up to date i think they do a pretty good job selecting the most important items
uh-huh
well i spent twenty years in commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in tv
and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits of bits and pieces of news on the air
i mean there are times where reporter actually will risk is life and limb i've seen it happen time and time again
for some reason because he was carrying a camera
they left him alone
um-hum
nice talking to you too jim
no
is that right well good
okay i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service
because it seems like and i'm thinking of the of community of people that are in jail now i think that maybe if
if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done because they understand people more they understand helping people more they understand the plight of people
uh-huh
right
um-hum
um-hum i would think that for like people that are just filthy rich
i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they
can see and i'm speaking about people that are like born rich
and that's all they know and i'm thinking that community service would help them just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know if they were to work in
i don't know in a soup kitchen or something they would understand how other people live
and you know on the same note if poor if
i don't know they probably have a better perspective of i don't know just life itself
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum demeanor yeah um-hum
right
uh-huh
that's great
um-hum and i think that you know this on the same note
being he was exposed to that and maybe he wasn't before and now he sees and i think that anybody that works
in the in some kind of service or for the community or something they can see you know you don't see what you don't you can't know what you don't see
you know so and you have to experience some things you know a lot of people know that people that other people are poor
but you they don't know what poor is
unless they actually see it and you know help or something
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
there's something i i've really been skeptical of you know when you watch television you'll see the service announcement for children in other countries
and if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day
or something like that and you can help a child
it's
i don't know i guess it's just me but i don't know whether to trust that or not
i mean there are so many scams and things going on you know i would love to help somebody
you know but i just i can't bring myself to
trust
this company who's trying to do this or whatever it is
you know just because people are so i don't know just today people are just so money hungry that i think they would do anything
and so i mean you don't know what they
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
yeah more self-centered
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
but you can't do that today
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah even when i first moved to dallas from new york it seemed like dallas was so open you know everybody left their doors open you just run in the store you leave your car running
you know and this was only well i guess it has been awhile it's been almost ten years since i moved here and it's amazing now how much it's changed i mean i don't go out i don't go outside at night you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hum
um-hum
wow
wow
better
um-hum
um-hum
oh
god that would be the exact opposite here i mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum that is sad
yeah that's a big that's a big thing with me i live in a one bedroom i'm single
and i've i could live in an apartment i live in waco okay and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments
and i live i don't make a lot of money but i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here
and i pay i'm paying probably the hundred or hundred and fifty dollars more
than i would be paying somewhere else but i wouldn't be able to sleep at night and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be you know i feel very safe where i am
you know instead of
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah they don't even consider it
um-hum yeah and it
to
yes i was talking to someone yesterday about that and we were saying that the basic the basic family is disrupted these days
and so i think you know before the father would work and the mother you know would stay home and having that mother there that base i think was a big part of family big part of
of what you know your youngsters thought about what they did you know
um-hum
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
when i called
um-hum
right
right
yes
yes
yes but i think it causes a lot of dysfunction in the family
women going out to work
for the money
yeah
i do too when it's a necessity i know but it's funny how it's changed because when my mother
well she took one year of normal school and then she taught school for three years before she met my father and they married and she had to quit teaching school because she was a married woman
so it it's changed a lot from then
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
parent
um-hum
um-hum
well i think that makes a big difference and i think it makes a big difference too if after your children are raised you want to go out and fulfill yourself
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yes i definitely think so and especially in those families that the husband does not have a college education
uh-huh
uh-huh
than just a wife because i'm not just a wife but a wife i i'm grateful that none of my daughters-in-laws at this time are working
after having served on the jury and come to a decision
and then the first thing that was done was after we found him guilty
his attorney jumped up and started going through the you know routine for filing an appeal
which you know i know that that's the right but the defendant but i mean it makes you wonder why go through it one more time when you know he admitted he was guilty of the crime
so i don't know that it was a little bit disgruntling to me
right
uh-huh
oh not
uh-huh
right
right
right
right
yeah do you use computers at work or
uh-huh
i see
yeah
something like that
oh
do you use your computer for other things balancing checkbooks do you keep budgets and that sort of thing in it or
that's right that's right
well mine kind of died so it's being worked on right now
i found a technician who works at ti
and does things like that in his spare time
oh yeah
yeah
but i most of the stuff i've used that computer for were work related just bringing work home
yeah
yeah i've done a lot of that
and i suspect most people do use them as terminals or
have a spreadsheet and a word processor and that's about it
what else do you need right
well that's probably true
yeah write your own games right
the computer i work have at work came with windows software and it has a couple of games on it one of which is a solitaire just
just standard card solitaire
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
yes
oh gosh and how long have you had them
yes
she's a mix of cockapoo cocker spaniel and poodle
and she's slowing down considerably she doesn't hear very well and she doesn't see very well but she's yeah at this age i guess so
yeah
i agree yes did you get yours as a pet for your do you have children uh-huh
uh-huh oh well i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before or
my goodness
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh
oh yeah
isn't that
yes so that often happens that way well we had intentionally planned to get a dog we had just moved into this house and decided to wait a about a year and then went then we went out then and found one she was in the litter and
she just loved this little dog to pieces but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her i think she was always a little bit leery of her
our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was not very interested in pets but as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals
uh-huh yes
yeah
that's right
yes i have been i have been reading and seeing about that on television uh-huh and how
uh-huh
is that right
isn't that amazing
uh-huh yes it's funny how pets can kind of oh take on a certain status in certain areas i mean that made me think of when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in saint louis and
there were several dogs on the campus and the what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly but they didn't appear to belong to anyone and i'm sure someone you know fed them they were healthy looking dogs
but our guide that day said that the one woman many years ago had given a huge sum of money to the university on the condition that there be dogs just kind of left to roam around the campus
i know
yes i know
so but i this is the only pet we've had you know in all our years of marriage and it's been sort of a change for my husband because as a boy growing up
uh-huh
yeah oh yes
oh my golly
ah
yeah
i'll be darned how interesting
uh-huh i guess i've heard that uh-huh
uh-huh
isn't that interesting that's really something how long did you have that
goodness sake
oh my gosh isn't that funny
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right
my goodness
uh-huh
i'll be
my goodness
that's
that's interesting i wouldn't picture a siamese as being an outdoor cat
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well
yeah so that was right
uh-huh
okay what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
oh i like sports type things too we like to get out and walk and we like the water sports too but like you it's unless you have a pool in your backyard it's kind of hard to get to do that
very often
yeah it does i've been
yes uh-huh i've been doing some cross-stitch for something i wanted to put in the nursery so i haven't done that in years but i've kind of enjoyed that but it's just hard to find the time to sit there and do it and
right yeah
i just go out just to just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes just look
yeah we bought some baby clothes yeah last weekend at a garage sale
yeah
uh-huh
wow yeah
yeah it kind of a hobby it that's time consuming too really to find the things you want sometimes you have to stop a lot of places
right yeah i think that's important too i'm not going to work after the baby comes
right
yes
oh
oh wow that'll make the summer go by in a hurry keep the kids busy
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh no
seems like sometimes hobbies do that they kind of take over and turn into work instead of
fun
yeah if it doesn't go crite quite right
oh no
oh that's nice
yeah
yeah we've done a little bit of camping we like that it's there again it's just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend
oh that sounds fun
yeah
well that sounds nice i think that'll be a good family thing
to start doing more often if
uh-huh
yeah we've camped with some friends who have young children and if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a lot
oh they have so much fun doing that and they think they're really great fishermen because they're catching so many
right yeah do you do any other crafts or anything besides just sewing
it's not too hard it's i don't think it's as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that
yeah i started to knit a sweater and i got off on my rows somehow and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front and then i tore it out and threw it down and i never have
oh uh-huh
yeah i remember that yeah
yeah they are pretty easy
well it's been real good talking to you and i hope you enjoy your camping trip
um-hum bye
oh go ahead i am glad to talk to an expert i always wanted to know who an expert was
well there there's two things
the one i'm interested the most i guess myself
would be the freons i mean for air the one i guess that's the one i'm most curious about is how they're going to replace the freons in air-conditioning
that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad
yeah i was you know where they were all concerned about that but that it seems to be
no i heard about it though
was that before i didn't see it was that before they actually did that or it was
because of that you know
right
are you don't work at ti
oh okay
where do you work in research or
oh okay
no okay yeah
yeah
well i'm kind of a car buff myself i was going to ask you another question but
i'll do that in a minute i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage
you know not using
no
really oh i'm a car buff too we ought to work talk about that one day
i think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety two percent ninety two octane i don't think you'll have any trouble
oh yeah
no i think i work on my own cars and
i don't think that's a problem i thought i'm saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline
oh the same thing about the war or related to the war on i was watching cnn and i cannot remember what station it was
what did you see the advertisements
when they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere it is so scary that
i hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know
did you see any of those i it was
it must have been channel thirteen i don't recall although i thought it was on cnn oh i
it was a somewhat of a commercial because it i saw it regularly
and it showed that and it was really devastating and it would
how much ash would fall and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know
oh really yeah there there's probably a lot of natural things
yeah
it i guess it's got to be really i don't know i don't know if it's air pollution it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not i don't know
yeah oh yeah well i live in arlington and there are no buses i mean there is the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses so
well i know it it's you know the car is we have this big romance with the car but i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well you said you were car buff i think that all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today because i think
you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever yeah when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but i think we all could in a family say
have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know
because they she don't even she doesn't put fifty miles a day on the car
no you're right i have seen them but they have a battery car
i went to the auto show this past week and they did not endorse now that i think of it
and i was so interested in the auto show i didn't think to ask anybody there were no electric cars i was surprised but now that you just mentioned that
yeah i think there could be a lot of i people close this is really we're
were nine years away or less i guess from the next century and i think
yeah they've got a they've got a area over in the se building too which is but it's a solar
it's for they got some money from a power company and it's probably more generating power for you know electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever
no i'm actually in the south building but
i was i'm the facility so i've been in all most of the buildings anyway
oh yeah well the solar area is right
right around from the auditorium now
and they they've got several different areas where they're called solar lab
it's right there on the first floor you ought to walk by there
yeah but the solar project you know ti's been into it for years and i guess it's just not economical yet because of the other fuels
yeah
i've seen some i think then again i'm surprised now i didn't think they'd asked anybody when i was in the auto show
air pollution or companies or anyone there it was just pure automobiles
there
hum
i didn't see did you go
oh
i was quite impressed with all the cars you know the engines are so much smaller now and everything and they're they all have brand new engines even general motors
very few only the caprice and them and the cadillac had eight the old v8s they're all brand new engines of course they're burning gasoline of course
now and
whether you know that's one way you know
on air pollution i don't know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really they've got catalytic converters everyone seem to have
gone to that whether they last and do a good job and now that they
the inspection systems are analyzing that well what do you think if you're in that you know if you're concerned about that i mean if you're knowledgeable on that
now i'm sorry excuse me
and i do that we recycle newspapers we take you know the dallas morning news daily and the plano paper daily and you know after a month of that you got a ton of newspapers
it really does i do recycle newspapers and glass
we don't really have enough plastic to mess with we don't you know like we don't drink milk and we don't have children so we don't have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs a month you know
yeah
right
but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different container
and plano has plans i believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in may of this year the city is going to leave receptacles at people's home and they
it certainly would and they can separate it and then the you know trash guys will pick it up
which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who can't or don't drive you know they can't get to the these centers
and i'm sure rather than try to ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know
but i think that's probably a good idea
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
uh-huh yes
yeah
great
i bet it was
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah it's just a matter of education i think
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that's right
i think basically it's a good idea you know i hope it works
absolutely
right
uh-huh right
uh-huh
sure absolutely
and there's just you know the two of us my wife and i and it's amazing how much stuff just the two of us generate you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five
it really does
as far as new stuff to recycle you know i don't really i don't really know i really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth
that's right i was uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
uh-huh
yeah
i see
that's right that's right
absolutely
that's right absolutely
uh-huh
i think they're made out of aluminum
yes there are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum but again we don't we don't generate that much so we don't
yeah
that's right
that ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and you know glass
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
car batteries
uh-huh
i don't you know i don't change my own oil so i don't i don't have that problem
yeah
uh-huh yeah well we do to as a matter of fact
right
yeah
yes we have one of those in town uh-huh
you know our church each year has a one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale and there's a ton of clothes always you know left over and i take those down to the
it's called the clothes closet that's what it's called here in plano right uh-huh and they distribute them to the people that need them
uh-huh yeah
no i really can't either
okay well it was nice talking to you
-kay
uh-huh bye-bye
yeah well i was surprised that they had their people their own people in the survey but then why not
oh i see
do you know what they're doing with all this when they're finished
um-hum
no i don't
oh i see
in other words they want to know if our voice can direct a machine
well gosh i couldn't direct children i doubt that i can direct a machine are you in dallas then
north of dallas
yeah we just came home from an expensive trip west and drove through the dallas fort worth area without stopping for any reason whatsoever and i
we're our town is five thousand so i was very concerned about what the trip the traffic would be like around dallas fort worth and gosh we were through there before we even realized that we were in heavy traffic so you've got a good system
shall we get on to nursing homes
okay
my mother is seventy will be seventy nine years old this fall and has been a nursing home resident for nearly three years
so i feel like i have
my decision was not i did not make the decision to send her to a nursing home she made the decision that she could not any longer live in
in her apartment by herself she had long since given up her home and gone into an apartment and of course that was her decision at the time too so
and then in that we are in a small royal a rural community i think that makes such a difference too because
well as a matter of fact my daughter is now the assistant director of nurses at that nursing home
yes she wasn't at the time
but she has since gone to that nursing home so i just feel that i did not have any of the trauma that people talk about
well it just did a really marvelous thing and mother's mind is good it's her body that's bad and
to have the responsibility of putting someone in a nursing home whose mind was not good and could not tell you if they were being mistreated or something it just would all be so different
hum
hum
um-hum
i'm fifty seven
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
in our locality we have a lot of government services like the home health care and etcetera which i'm sure they do in cities too
but we do not have the staff to draw from to find someone who could stay for day in and day out with we just don't have those people
they just are not available even though you would like to make that choice
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
hum
hum
hum
how long
how long were you able to maintain that
oh uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh
um-hum
um-hum your mother was not living or
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
i just never considered the moving in with i could not ever have handled that my mother is incontinent and i don't know i suppose that would have been my excuse
but i don't think had that situation not existed that i could have done that at all i'm not
i
um-hum
um-hum
well i think my sister is an rn and lives in knoxville tennessee and i think that my mother had thought in the back of her mind that she perhaps might go to jean's and it did take when she first went into the care center
she just completely gave up just could not even sit up in the wheelchair without being tied in
and that went on for almost six months and finally my sister came to visit and mother was talking about getting better and getting out of the care center
and my sister is very blunt and she said mother this is going to be your home you might as well get used to it which i could not say to her
and from that point on i think within the next six months she came to accept that as fact and then she began improving and is walking better now than she probably did in three years but
still for the most part she is wheelchair bound or bed bound and
i don't know i guess maybe i have accepted that the nursing home is her home because i've started to decorate her room more than i ever did in the beginning so
even though everyone knows that's the way it has to be you still it takes a little bit to accept
no and certainly it's very expensive there's no question about that
but we had a severe ice
so what kind of animals do you have
uh-huh
yeah i have a dog and a cat
well it was very it was interesting because it it's just you know part of their makeup they're psyche i mean they just hate each other automatically but after a while they got to be good friends and
uh-huh
yeah
well i'll tell you one thing i found with pets i think cats
are easier to take care of especially when on a situation like you go off on a trip you know it's a real pain with a dog because you have to have someone come over and walk them and let them out and that kind of thing
oh that's amazing
yeah
that is interesting i hadn't ever heard anything like that but
yeah we've been we've been pretty lucky too the reason we first got the dog to begin with was i lived i'm in school still and i lived closer to campus
and as usual the neighborhoods right near campus aren't that nice
yeah
well she's not pure and
we tried to figure out what she was crossed with we know the mother was a shepherd but she looks like she's crossed with like greyhound because she is just thin as a rail and
my sister has a pure bred gold yellow lab and that dog has every problem you could imagine you know it's allergic to fleas it's got another skin condition and just
so we haven't really had much problems with her she's just extremely hyper and i guess that accounts for her physique and she runs like a gazelle so
it's fun to take her to the park and watch her run rings around all the other dogs
trying to play with them and they look at her like you're crazy you think i'm going to catch you
so yeah either
right
okay where have you been on vacation lately
oh yeah
have you got another one planned
but also since my in-laws just moved to utah we're kind of pressured to go up there and go snow skiing and i've never been snow skiing so i'm not really into that i would rather do the beach scene
yeah
oh really
like in the in the virgin islands
oh yeah
yeah that's definitely true well i got a magazine the other day called caribbean life and it had
different charter boats in there where like three couples could charter a boat and have a crew and everything but
you just pretty much go wherever you want to go and they had great summer rates so like if you do it before september or october or something like that you really save a ton of money and i would love to do that
oh really i didn't know that
yeah
that'd be fun
really
wow well all the pictures i've ever seen of it has just been gorgeous but i don't know i think i think i'd
there's other places that i would rather go first i think maybe
australia and down in there i mean the pictures i've seen of that even
oh i can't even think of the island now but she told us just wonderful stories of the island and the pictures she showed us and all that i can't think of the place now it's a pretty big one oh venezuela
well i wherever she wherever she was she was out you know on the edge but anyway she had some great pictures and i always thought that would be fun to go there and they have great beaches too
yeah
oh really yeah
hey that would be fun yeah when i was little i always heard how romantic rio was but i would like to go to tahiti too that'd be fun
but even just like in the states it was fun when we went to mackinac island that was pretty cool
yeah
oh really
huh
yeah because it i was there at the end of july and it was still pretty cool
so yeah i'm not a cold weather person at all
well i think that once we get the house refinanced we're going to probably try to take our free tickets and either go to cancun or
do the little trip to southern california and then on up to utah
so i don't know we'll see
oh really
yeah i think i'm going to work in a business trip and go to san diego
well that's true hadn't thought about that
well they could get really big though and hire a secretary and then you could have to go train
yeah tell them to do that
yes
but i mean a trip is a trip
so
oh i would too in a drop of a hat fortunately we aren't tied down with any other little two legged responsibilities we can go
yeah makes a big difference
well take it
oh really
well good
uh-huh
ooh i love new orleans
oh yeah
such good food
oh god yeah that's the first time i ever saw an actual transvestite i think was in new orleans
really
oh yeah
well i guess i'll go take my shower i've been working out so i'll do that
well i'll talk to you later
no we just hang up
okay bye
any particular reason that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you
yeah
and you do stick by it when you do it huh
well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in and the expenses and whatever's left over i spend
that just kind of seems to be the way it works
pardon me
and
um-hum
yes and i know that theory unfortunately neither i'm married and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of self-control in the world
and so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at times you know instead of thinking oh we'll save it this month we'll think well oh gee we'll buy this lamp or this whatever you know
so our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain
but are you married
oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way
have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee
uh-huh
well i agree it's
maybe for us anyway it's easier just to put it all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who you know who donates what to it
but we just kind of started out that way and
oh
uh-huh
well that's a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married too
no it's not a whole lot of fun
um-hum
um-hum
which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check you'll think oh well i just won't put anything
or you know even if it's of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway i'm sure but once it goes into the checking account it's awfully hard to transfer it over
that's a good idea
um-hum
and your fiancee she'll she goes along with the savings part too even though she's managed to get herself into debt
um-hum
well actually i know some people a girlfriend of mine who was married probably about three or four years ago and they still have separate checking accounts that's the way they prefer it
you know she doesn't go into detail as to why they prefer it that way or anything but it's everybody as long as i think your
okay what do you think about it
oh yeah
uh-huh yeah i do too i think it's going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby
but that will be it or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work i mean it really is coming to that because most women
now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them they can't even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like
yeah
right
now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small
until they got in junior high school my youngest one got in junior high i didn't have to work i mean i didn't work i needed to but i didn't
oh yeah
right well it's getting where you can't hardly afford if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two
and i mean it's hard with two now we my youngest one i have two i have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon but if i had a third one
i just don't know where it would come from
because i work now i work full time and you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that helps out but still it cost a lot
right
and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous
i mean absolutely outrageous and they're getting worse
my daughter brought home a book the other day
that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes and it was like ninety six dollars and this book is a little bitty skinny book i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know but it is it's getting worse and
if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it you know without me working
right but i think i would have had to work if i'd of had that many i'd of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work
but i think it's getting more and more like when you have one child now that's it you know then you go to work and you work because
yeah
well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time and well i work all week and i can't imagine how i stayed home you know i think to myself what did i do
and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter
somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but i mean it is so far down the road where now when i graduated high school the thing uh-huh and then you got married and then you had a family
i mean that's just the way it was you know and that's like when my i know when my mother's age it was
always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an
yeah
uh-huh
right
yeah but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything and
we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school and i didn't have kids for four and a half years
but that was because i wanted to work and i wasn't ready for kids and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her you know
right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now well you don't just get ready
but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year and i just was not ready for kids i wanted to get out and work a little bit and
i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and kids didn't fit in right then but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples and really
if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have it i don't care what anybody tells you and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way
because that's like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then
and even though i'd like to have grandchildren i can see her point
right
uh-huh
yeah
there's so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries i mean it really does except for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff but the rest of it we just buy things like
boats or we go on trips or you know just
the more or less like entertainment stuff but
yeah i feel like i have you know because well we're to the age now i'm not old but i'm older
and i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do but now i could not go back and do it i really couldn't i don't think i could stay home all the time and do nothing and i mean i did stuff but
but
well you know more and more of them are i don't know if it is up there where you are but where i am the just like all the hospitals they're getting day care but the reason they had to do this was because so many people
you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying
all your salary to pay for those two kids to go so more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it's mainly the hospitals
i
oh really
well what are your did you like do you use credit cards
huh-uh so it doesn't gets the credit
interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think don't you
otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly
it's not a very good idea
well i have a lot of them but i don't use them very much though
i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes
tuition if it's
you know if i'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can
the other thing i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off
more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require
just goes on and on
yeah
yeah that's true
there are times when it's when it's very useful like emergency trip
or something sometimes when you when you
the money will be available but it's
you know not immediately handy i think they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes
but i you really do need to be very
oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble
uh-huh
right
right that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances
the other thing about them is too if you really don't you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and haven't developed a credit thing
it stops you from doing a lot of things if you if you pay for everything by cash there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or
but it's true you have to be very careful or you end up
going in the deep end and an awful lot of people are in trouble
we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card
company that and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out of them and
poor thing he comes home very depressed every night
it's a really big problem i think and takes mature people to
to treat it so that it's so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
yeah
right it doesn't do you any good now does it right
even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it
you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying
so well i'm not that other than that i don't have too much on credit cards but
it's good to talk to you
uh-huh bye now
it sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high
it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether we pay more tax now than we did ten or twenty years ago but it doesn't seem like we get as much out value for the tax dollar
uh-huh
yeah it does seem like the special interest groups are what keeps taxes high
uh-huh
oh boy
yeah that does make it difficult
well i used to work in finance but i don't any longer
i was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to other countries i seem to recall that many other countries have higher tax rates than ours
but they may also get better value for the dollar that's the real question
uh-huh
right
right that's what's irritating
uh-huh
hm i don't remember hearing that
uh-huh
i'm from texas but now i live in california
and what state is that in
still in texas
course in texas at least you still don't have income tax
child care seems to be a topic that
varies i guess with where you are geographically if you're in an area where you got a lot to select from then i guess there are a lot of criterias to choose from but if you're in an area where there's two or three then you get what you can take
and i guess it'd depend on the age of the child the needs of the child how long the child has to be there if it's a five day a week deal i would certainly look a lot harder than if it was just a couple of days a month
and we're in a situation where it's just one maybe two days a month at best so we're
in only a couple of hours usually what we use them for now is to transport them between school and the day care center and have them wait there just long enough for me to get off work and go pick them up
so it's nice to just have them there for the limited time frame but the
the drawback is the pay structures there's so many different situations that these day care centers have to get into they have a lot of the ones have just decided that
they will simplify their work load by saying if you get on the bus to ride between school and day care you'll pay ten dollars regardless of whether you road one way or both ways and regardless of whether you stayed there just half an hour or three hours
they just averaged it all out but most kids stay until about six so it will be about ten dollars which will cover the ride and cover the hours you stay
and i've got one kid getting out at two forty five and one getting out at three thirty so the one gets picked up at two forty five gets there by about three
and i'm there a little before four o'clock to pick them up
so he doesn't stay there even an hour and the other child is not even there when i get there and doesn't get there until about four it's about thirty minutes to do a ten minute ride in there little bus and
so the you know just for the doesn't really work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one way bus ride for these two kids but some days we have to do it some days it just works out to where i don't get into work early enough to get off
early enough to get them but fortunately the other end of the deal is some days my wife
being a dental hygienist works by appointments so she if she has a day scheduled where she has to get the kids into the day care to of them take them to school and she has a
an appointment say at eight thirty and she has to be all the way across town at her office at eight thirty then she needs to have them ride the bus one way and i'll get off in time to hopefully pick both of them up and not have the day care center in the other direction
but just a myriad of possibilities that these people have to serve so they have a myriad of pay structures but it can get expensive most of them run
four some as many as five dollars an hour per child for what we call drop in care which is the situation we're in we're not a regular so the days we do use them we pay through the nose and
and make their kids stay there we found on in the area that is letting us pay as little as two fifty an hour that's still five dollars an hour for two of our kids and it it's fun we try to keep it to a minimum
yeah it's
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah
well even if you work out the economics if you get over all the other hurdles of the ratio of workers to kids and the infant
worker areas how well that's closed off or how not well that's closed off from the other noise
once you get over all the other hurdles just the economics of it it's not
as much of an impact to stay home as it were if you figure in what it would cost you to go back to work and you know the
yep
that
that's it
so it's gotten it's changed a little bit over the years but
um-hum
right
well what the market can bear and
boy there are kids in this little section of plano that we're in we're surrounded
less than a mile we have six different centers to our at our disposal so
we can go north to two of them or south to three of them or just over west a little bit further and there's two more over there there's just all around us but and we've been to everyone of them over the time
but the kids the kids just well we used to use them a little more than we do now that they're in school and the kids just kind of get tired of them
they get tired of the you know what's available to play on and what's outside and plus they tend to just shift around in who runs them for a while and the pay structure changes and
so we've just moved with wherever's it happens to be cheapest and they happen to want to survive at and they want to live at this one for a while
and we found it cheaper even during the summer for me to take off for half a day since we work a four and a half day work week and come home on these thursdays that she goes to work at eleven and get's off at seven thirty at night
and that she does that on thursdays and then occasional saturday's and i can take off on those thursday's and be home in time for her to go off to work and it's cheaper for me to do that and take my vacation even if i
take all thirteen weeks of summer that's less than right at a weeks full week's worth of vacation and i have you know three weeks a year i'm i've been there long enough to do that
now i always end up in a must take situation anyway so
we decided to eat it up that way and still take a week off and still have a few days to for whatever week long weekends or the like and
i think we're going to do that again this summer like we did last summer because we paid close to seven or eight hundred dollars just to have someone come into the home
at a couple a dollars an hour
to take care of them on those thursdays throughout the summer so
it it's hard to find the prices i guess that does seem to be one of the major driving factors
yeah
oh boy
well i guess they haven't had the i don't know what the incentive would be but
yeah
it must be on what they're counting on
cross paths later bye
it's hard topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to high school
yes well yeah i am
actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling
but it's the job that the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in new york city or washington dc
i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that
well that's really too bad because it it's giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in florida what we learned
yeah
yeah
oh they have that down there that
yeah it's like if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school
yeah that's where i was fortunate i'm a i'm a technician and we had a vocational electronics in our high school
so when i went to my first year of tech school i had a very easy time because our high school had a good program
yeah i find that the that in the in the cities it's more less the kids go there
to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that
that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage
trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day
so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from
hopefully they'll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the large ibm plant has something to do with the top rated high school
because of their tax base for one and plus for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school
because your parents are engineers or chemists they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you
i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in
i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a system level really to find out and to see what they need and not overinflate it
like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we're in a recession here
we our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many years just because people are in the recession and they're even though
we've enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa
so
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school
in some places you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school so
yeah the i don't
or anything that would contribute see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job
is it
well that
well
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's university of vermont
we also have some two year college well there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you
okay
well i like to cook but i don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because
and so i don't like to arrive or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so
yeah exactly
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
boy i like that
yeah well i'm planning a and naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and the next night hm on tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether so
oh yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that's fun
uh-huh
yeah
yeah that's a good idea
yeah
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that's good well one of my favorites if i don't wanna have other people bring stuff i just wanna treat them is to make chicken and rice it's very easy to
you don't like it oh you do okay yeah i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken and then you
put rice in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and or you put the chicken in then pour the broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want and then just
yeah over uncooked rice and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven and it just it fluffs up and it's really moist and
um-hum
uh-huh ooh yeah
hm well i'll keep that one in mind too yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah you can get away with it and you know in having a semi nice dinner or you know semi formal but
yeah
yeah you put in let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice or
it depends on you can really vary it but you have to put the water in proportionally i can't remember i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups broth
and
yeah that's flavor um-hum
yeah
but i think it's about an hour or maybe it's only half hour hm
you just until the rice looks fluffy and not overdone you know before it gets overdone
yeah i'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster but
yeah well i liked it your idea too there
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i need to find out from you how the last
remodeling project you undertook and if it was successful and you were pleased with what happened
you've been doing any remodeling lately
uh-huh
all right did you like the results
uh-huh
all right
yes it does what kind of molding is this molding
oh
uh-huh
well that's a lot of fun we
oh yeah decorate a nursery or something huh
oh okay yes get some get an extra room there for the new baby
what's that
no we've done some painting and put up some wallpaper in the boys' room
we needed to paint because the paint was getting dingy or grain plus there was a lot of markings on the on the paint that
well on top of the bunk beds the boys got up there and started drawing on the ceiling and that was kind of hard to get off so we decided rather than wash it all off and clean it up we decided to paint over it
the walls were textured and there was a lot of holes from the previous owners and so we patched them all up and painted and put border and wallpaper along the top
and it looks really nice now and we we're quite pleased with it and
it looks pretty good there's a lot of other things that cheryl would like me to do but
well good
uh-huh
well good you put on a deck there recently too haven't you or that's been a couple of years
uh-huh
wow
painted it with
well good
yeah we have one
yes i
yeah they are they make a lot of noise but they're good
we haven't used ours yet we'd like to use ours
no i haven't
yeah so it doesn't jam up
yes i have
it was my dad's and i used it with him
and was able to paint some things and
and he said he didn't need it anymore and he gave it to us and we haven't had a chance to or need to paint anything down here yet i i'm kind of leery about using it inside
because it does put a lot of particles and mist in the air that i didn't want to get all over the carpet or
uh-huh
oh it was
yeah that's right that's right
oh
yes
um-hum
oh good
um-hum
well the weather i understand was pretty good at that time
yeah the weather
weather is beautiful down here real nice real nice it got up to about seventy five degrees down here and that's kind of the right temperature to be painting things but
yeah it's we would like to like to do a little bit more we'll probably do some we were working recently out on our spa
and hot tub trying it was really overgrown with a lot of
i guess what is it honeysuckle
especially during the reagan now bush administrations
we seem to have a double standard in place over how we treat them countries down there for example
a left wing regime or communist regime is god awful and basically you know satan incarnate
while nations like for a long time el salvador and guatemala
with right wing regimes we kind of just winked at things like death squads and alike yeah we found nicaragua to be the most horrible thing in the earth
and i just felt and it's the same thing with cuba that we really seem to have this kind of double standard down there
whereas if your regime doesn't want to bother us a reason of threat to us we'll kind of ignore you
you can do whatever you want but if you invite the commies in you know look out
um-hum
you wouldn't want them in
yeah it's like how many guatemalan and el salvador refugees have we seen and heard about in the last ten years
yet nicaraguan refugees for the longest time were welcome with open arms as escapees and
and any communist type of regime down there i mean the whole the whole farce in granada
right was it just
down there and that seems to be well we'll give you aid but oh no not to feed your people no we want you to clean up
well it's the same thing that happened with iraq for years and years
here we are sending money over here playing these people off of each other it's was same thing in iraq playing saddam hussein off you know off of iran
in this case panama off of nicaragua and cuba and any of the other left wing regimes down there
and for what does it leave us with absolutely nothing
i mean it wouldn't surprise me
and i just think you know we have this kind of short term we are not interested in developing the region unless there's big business involved and wants to get involved down there
yep
okay well
maybe so far it's been enough it seems like it seems like
subjects
you know and allocated towards the aids research i think that aids research has been a lot of the funding has not been done by the government a lot of it has been done by private endowment
but i think the government is doing a good job so far
of keeping the their portion of the funding up
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
right
um-hum
exactly it although i was i was shocked at the public outrage that occurred after i think it was dan quayle who said
likely most effective solution is you know abstinence and yet the a large portion of the community said well that's stupid you know that just shows that you have no interest in spending any money on the on the problem and i thought
that's not that's not the point at all
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah i got three how about yourself
oh you've got young children then
oh my goodness that's great
what kind of mix do you have a boy and a girl or
two boys
i don't blame you
well we got two boys and a girl well we got two boys and a girl well
yes so maybe you'll get lucky and get a girl this time
well our boys one is
he's in graduate school at a&m he's in the navy he's a lieutenant in the navy and the navy's sending him for his master's in ocean engineering
we got another boy that's out in maryland he's a wildlife biologist
and our girl is thirteen she's in
seventh grade so we got
still all sorts good activities with her
well she's into a little bit of everything she's
loves riding horses so she goes out riding as much as she can and
well yeah but mainly at a riding place that's north of town that she goes she rides english and does jumping takes lesson and all that kind of stuff yeah
and
yeah she's into
oh she plays the flute in the band and
piccolo and she's into this odyssey of the mind thing which is takes a lot of time for
it's for
what they call pace group i don't know if you've gotten into that with your kids but that's for the
kind of
well it's a program for
higher the advanced kids yeah
sure
oh okay
okay you know what that
well my wife is involve she kind of heads that up for these kids and
last year they got the state level they didn't win that but they got won local and region and they got a new mix of kids this time so
keeps them busy keeps
well yes but well they have what they well you probably know a pace group that
they're advanced type the they're special
classes for pace classes i think this happens to be
history is what their peace classes is this year but so they
she enjoys that kind of stuff and does well with it so yeah
yeah always something to do
okay
that'd be fun
oh yeah
you got to go tobogganing and sledding with them
well you're welcome to keep that
well i grew up in wisconsin i had plenty of snow and when i was a kid and
we've lived here about seventeen years but we used to take all the kids tobogganing and ice skating and all that kind of stuff the boys and it's a lot of fun really
as long as you don't have to drive in it
i had plenty of snow to last me forever i don't
care if i ever see any well i don't care if i see it but
yes
well you got you got you got five months before you'll see that
oh yeah our oldest son when
and i guess
well
made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but
anyway being in rochester you probably like the mets
oh boy it the i think it's like one or the other isn't it i mean you either
yeah
oh okay
i see yeah i like the i guess if i had to pick a favorite team i'd i
anymore well as i kind of grew up rooting for philadelphia
i'm from new jersey originally
yeah well we were thirty miles south of them so
right yeah right down the river but so what are the mets going to do this year without strawberry
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
well his knees were bothering him yeah
yeah for having him out there
oh boy
yeah i think we were all pretty much astros fans in the in the national league championship series but there's like two fellows
from brooklyn
yeah
yeah
okay well i'm not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs but these two were definitely thugs and they were from brooklyn
so i'm kind of hoping i guess anymore i pretty much pull for the rangers though they were they're they have the i think they have the best
facilities in the major leagues
i love going to watch a game in arlington stadium it's great
yeah
the only problem is it's not large enough it only holds about i think they when ryan struck out his five thousandth player they squeezed about forty thousand people in there
yeah so they're they have plans i mean the owner tried to move them to florida but
they ended up sticking around in arlington and they're going to build a new stadium in arlington as a matter of fact not even in dallas so that's
that's something that we're looking forward to
yeah have you seen a game up there
oh boy i saw i was up there on business last june and watched a game in the sky dome it was just phenomenal that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think
yeah
uh-huh
now is rochester where is cornell university
ithaca
okay
yeah well rochester's like right on the shores isn't it
yeah okay
okay
well they say that from that space needle up in toronto you can see the lights of rochester on a clear night
yeah
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
those games are fun to watch you watch those games
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah we used to like watching my folks lived down in beaumont and on the campus of lamar university they used to house the beaumont golden gators
who were a double a team for the padres i think but they were fun games to watch
yeah
yeah
but they they've got so much young raw talent it's just amazing and then they just haven't been able to put anything together
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah i mean they've been
they've been young for a while and they're almost starting to age a little bit here i just yeah they they're really hurting pitching wise i mean they've got ryan but you know who knows
what he'll be able to do he's been last year he started having some nagging injuries and
but it'll be interesting to watch i hope to get up there we usually try to get to opening day game there's several guys from our church try to go up there
yeah well i guess we're probably oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of dallas
no not too bad about it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there
that's probably because of the roads you just don't yeah we we've just got a freeway we just get right on the freeway and just go north
well it's so crowded up there
golly
yeah
well i don't know you're like a boat ride from how far is it across the lake to canada toronto
yeah
you do you drive there or do you take the ferry or what
yeah
yeah it's a it's a beautiful city
i really like it
um-hum
so and then and then you go back to new york after school
or new york city
oh really
well what kind of weather are you having right now
oh boy yeah we've been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple weeks ago already
we're it's
golly because of the ice
hum
golly
huh illegal
oh yeah
why don't you go ahead and start
so you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to admit or not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
in germany when i was a student and
that's the sort of system they have the trials are held by a panel of
they do the questioning also the judges do the questioning and
it's i think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they
the judge is also sort of a jury
but i'm not sure i like that i think i prefer the jury system myself
because anytime the government
is the government against the individual you need some yeah they need the protection of ordinary citizens i think that's really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system change is
there ought to be well
i guess i don't think that
juries need to decide sentencing all the time i think maybe the a judge is a better judge of that or
yeah
well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent that's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe
but people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with
what prison's really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that
is maybe a little bit naive
in texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people
it's kind of a
i guess
i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
i kind of like that system yeah
yeah
yeah
right
and lawyers blow sand in their eyes
i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
insurance cases and things like that
and there'd be more honest settlements instead of this
tugging of people's heart strings and making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them
so
in i think in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but in civil trials
i'd like
hum that sounds interesting
well my i've got some fairly bizarre but i do a lot of flying aerobatics for one
so but probably if i had to say my most favorite one was probably be flying
did you oh you actually tried it before
as a student pilot
how long did you do it
hum
hum
well needlepoint looks pretty
i think you know if it's done real you know if it's done right it looks really good
hum
boy that's tedious
hum
what type of scenes do you do
hum
i've been over to plano quite a few times my brother lives over there and i've yet to see anything like that over there
oh okay so it's on the other side
hum
well that's pretty neat though i mean i wish i had that much patience to sit down and do something tedious like that but
after a while it would just drive me nuts
yeah
hum
i like i like i like building furniture probably the best that sort of thing
when i had the equipment and the place to set it up
i like
things that are difficult to do i like to see if i can do it
back when i was in college i took lots of wood courses and then i even did it after i was out of college i continued to do it and i built just about every stick of furniture in my house
everything from dining furniture to armoire to the whole nine yards
takes a long time to do all that stuff
um-hum
hum
um-hum
birds
oh those are interesting
see which ones talk do the do they talk
hum
about the only thing i had when i was growing up was probably a parakeet and canary
and we could let it out and fly around the house a little bit
and
oh they wouldn't really you know didn't really want you to pick them up per se but you know when i did they didn't they didn't give me a lot of trouble
that's unbelievable i would never have thought that you know that they would leave you alone without trying to attack each other
um-hum
yeah that nice expensive
yeah
huh
well they get used to each other
guess they know they have to live together so they may as well make the best of it
i get most of my news from newspapers really i read the daily newspaper the houston chronicle and sometimes i'll read like the
wall street journal or the new york times i don't subscribe to either but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it how about you do you mostly get news from tv or newspaper
oh that's interesting you said computer networks what sort i'm fairly knowledgeable about oh okay that's interesting
i've never used the dow jones news wire
but yeah it do you do you get any do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach
interesting in what way in like in sort of like a quality or sort of the orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
you well you won't offend me so go ahead and say
yeah like a liberal type of bias
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah they generally make mistake on anything technical at least but
yeah
yeah do you by mistakes do you do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they're deliberate sorts of things
yeah
yeah
hm
hm that's disturbing
i haven't really noticed them doing that but
whatever again i don't watch tv news that much now if i had access to cnn i would watch tv news more i don't you know but i don't usually yeah
yeah did you did you think that cnn well the gulf war coverage would be kind of abnormality i just i guess
i'd be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say cnn tv news compared to the three networks
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
yeah i have not even heard believe it or not of that person i'm not kidding when you when you said it was kind of like a surprise
yeah i think mainly because i haven't been watching what's politically going on in that you know
in that aspect as far as like now the new health bill that went through minnesota being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in minnesota and more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed
but as far as politics in the grander
part of it as if you want to look at election type things i'm not quite sure even if i'm going to vote
it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run
um-hum
sure
exactly
um-hum
sure
um-hum sure
he might be a one of those sure it it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer
when you think of some of the best presidents we've had in the past have been people that have struggled to get to the top i mean they were not rich in any means
and it has been kind of in the past i don't know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics they've had to have money
and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way
so it makes the common person not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent and
i don't know if we'll ever see that you know where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and has
you know you think of abraham linking lincoln and you know just the background of abraham lincoln you know teaching himself to read he didn't go to college he didn't
you know do all the other things that you know you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically involved and have money he didn't come from money
and now it
um-hum sure
um-hum
so you really know a lot of his background
it was the big one it's the one that everybody wants yeah whether or not you know you look at all these candidates that want to become president i really have to ask them why you know
it's the toughest job in the world to do and not only that you don't have that much freedom to make choices i mean you have to go through so many different you got to go through the house the congress and all of the a other things to get a bill passed
and sure you can veto it at the last minute but then it's not like you have all that power and i think along time ago presidents did have a lot of power and i think we're
huh
no we're not being tested for drugs at all
our policies and procedures manual the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or it's reasons for immediate dismissal it says use of narcotics on company premises
but i think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field what is the nature of your company's business
huh
oh really
but you know they don't think twice about serving
beer by the keg you know but i think drug testing and i don't know
i guess i think it's got some relevance but i think its relevance is pretty limited i mean i think you know in your case i don't think that
you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing i think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident
um-hum
how do you manage your budget
um-hum
yeah
well i in my younger years i'd always heard the adage you should buy as much of a house as you can afford
because of the improvement in real estate prices
and on the last move we bought ourselves a fairly large house
and i've got some pretty stiff mortgage payments now
and the
improvement in income and investments and so forth has not come at the rate i've expected so we're still kind of hurting by the high mortgage payments and we haven't gotten out from under them yet
but
so far we've managed to hold our own by
trying to set up a monthly budget
i try to take out just so much cash for me and my give so much cash to my wife
to spend on groceries and clothing and fuel for the car
and then the rest of it's pretty much fixed expenses mortgage electricity
water and
and garbage collection and telephone bills and cable television bills
and those are pretty much fixed
yeah
um-hum
yeah no my wife's pretty good about grocery shopping and
she pitches in and makes clothes for the kids
which is a big help one of our big problems though is handling unexpected budget items
like this month the heat pump went out and
they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace that
well we have to cut into the savings at this point to buffer that
and
so it's the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the budget
yeah
yeah
well do you have some savings plans at work
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah we've been looking around at
trying to develop some side activities that might help out such as creating some craft objects that we can market in the local stores
or
making some dresses for children or things like that or even writing children's books
and
i tried this past year writing journal articles but i found out it cost me more than the honorariums i got for writing them
well especially the first one because i wound up buying a lot of reprints for handouts and i ate up all my profits with
buying reprints
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
oh we thought we were going to be pretty tight with christmas this past year
but we have a family dog that ate all of the children's toys
and get them a whole new set of playthings
so far it's doing fairly well we're in the metropolitan washington area
and i guess most of the area is still living off the federal government with
beltway bandit type contracts
our company is done fairly well
and
i'm with the melpar division of e-systems
yeah
we're primarily in the systems integrations business
selling to the government
um-hum
well my parents are both in their seventies my mother and stepfather and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies and my
father and stepmother are not in very good health so this is
yes it is
yes they are they are
not for them my mother and stepfather have
set up an arrangement where they have a large home and two of my sisters
and their families one of them husband and then all the children are living in this home its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms and they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen and my father bought this
my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home
unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home
um-hum
well i felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also i
i read a lot and then i know people that then have visited nursing homes and
have had great grandparents in the nursing homes and it was not a happy situation for
for any of them and
we have a very active nursing home here in plano that has activities going all the time and they have
go and participate in olympics and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here
you know so there are a lot of a lot of activities going on all the time and this is a nursing home it's not a senior citizens home so that the people are really
right they need the nursing care and but it's a very expensive solution
right
right
right
right and that's right i well i took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation and they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home
who had apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating and he had apparently had not been in the home too long just a week or so but when they the family came in to see him
they had not been made aware i was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance and i overheard their conversation and when the family walked in his wife and daughter and son-in-law they were not even aware of what had happened
so i told them he strangled on some chicken
and they said the woman the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that would require chewing or
so you know and i thought
and then she was upset he had on two different shoes one of which was not even his he had on a pair of slacks and the wife said these are not his slacks and she said i just took two pair over yesterday for him
that clean and
right well i this was just
something that i was i witnessed to and at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour
and with just a curtain of course between us and
they the revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth and he was definitely just by looking at him and the way he acted you could tell he was in need of
of nursing home care but the family were all talking about
putting him in another home they said he will not go back
to that one
i'm glad they the option
i would hate to be in a position where
that was all i could afford and there weren't there was no choice
oh my
um-hum
right
right
that's right
um-hum
visits everyday or right
visit right
right
suspicious
i guess there was not a name for what she had at that time but i guess alzheimer's would come as close as anything she really was not aware of what she was doing
and
i can remember she had several strokes and the nursing home was right next to a hospital and they'd rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home
in a couple of days and it was she was it was just like keeping something
are you
i'm calling from miami
utah well we've got a long distance connection tonight
you ready to start i am
she has told me some horror stories but other than that i was thinking about the fact that so many kids nowadays can't even identify on the map on a globe where they are
and it's just astounding to me
yeah
the children get at home on education because this friend of mine who's a school teacher was telling me she said you know
that she has kids that are indian and pakistani oriental you know some of them who have only been in the united states maybe for two generations
that she said their english is excellent their social skills are good and you know why is it that they can be such model citizens and yet
you know other young kids who have you know been born and bred here in the us just don't seem to get it
right
yeah i'm beginning to wonder if maybe year round school would not be a bad a bad thing
yeah
yeah
i don't certainly don't have the answer to it i know that in houston for example where i'm i have some friends who
were telling me that they have the option there of selecting the school that they want their kids to go to
and
sort of like a business in a way such that if enough people are interested in sending their children there it gets more funding and those schools that are less successful less successful get less money
yeah the
uh-huh
but i don't know if that's the answer but i do think that there needs to be some changes made somewhere along the way
oh it's a nightmare
well and the very idea that anyone could graduate from high school and not and not know how to read or write
it's scary
uh-huh
yeah
oh i think so too and i think that's about the only thing you can do to clean up government or clean up the political side of government is to kick the bums out periodically limit the terms
yeah but
have you been to washington
have you watched those folks in action i mean i visited the house and the senate and sat there in the gallery and watched those folks up there pontificating to a room full of no one
i don't know i it it's like their not in the real world or something and maybe that's why they have
have trouble drawing lines as to what's illegal and what's not
sure
yeah
well
yes that's true i think they do things that make it easier for our elected representatives to live the good life
it's almost like they're royalty of some sort and i think that's why they forget sometimes that laws apply to them too
yeah but aren't they making something like a hundred and ten thousand a year
that's
yeah i what gets me is when they pass laws and they always manage to exempt themselves from them
oh yes but i mean is it no wonder that there's not a balanced budget when they can't even handle their own checking accounts
i don't know
no probably not
that's right i they get caught up i think in the
the glamour and the power and whatnot and probably make bad decisions bad choices sometimes
that's true
i think he's an honest person
and he and he certainly has no need to have his hands in anybody else's pockets
shall
actually i've had i've had very good luck on consumer products lately
gotten recently it's been a new mother board for my computer and that's working fine
yeah
because my other one bit the dust after a power failure
so i got a you know a very inexpensive motherboard from someone in california very happy we were very fast
how about you
yeah i hear you there the i guess you know given a choice most people are kind of holding off on
getting anything i'm trying to think back in mind if there's ever been anything i got
you know the things i've been most disappointed with is that when you go those time share gimmicks
right you know i find there's that you just have to be really careful
because like especially if you watch tv there's like all such of scams going on where you know like you really have to listen to what they're selling you i mean there's a lot of things like
god you like you know yes you can get whole sacks of beef you know delivered fresh to you if you buy our thousand dollar refrigerator
or
you know all these multilevel marketing things
right
right
i really think multilevel marketing is undermining
the quality of american business because people getting so focused on the progress other than the products
you know it's like well you know i could get two hundred distributors on to me each selling one dollar a week and i'll be rich but
you know amway and al williams insurance which i guess is primerica now
mary kay you know they they're something
yeah oh we have dallas to blame for mary kay
but yeah i find that you know the place where i think the one place were we you know consumer price i did fairly well i was leading electronics industry
um-hum
yeah
too expensive in my opinion but
right
oh no not that
and you know i typically when your vcr breaks what you have to do you have to like give it to these guys for weeks
and then eventually they'll get it back to you but i happen to know this guy who i met recently he just like took it down to his basement popped off the cover you know took a couple of things off so okay this is just junked up cleaned it out it's working fine didn't charge me anything
you know i think that the really where the american consumer products kind of failing is in the customer service
the chain the some really luxurious department store in texas
okay so are you a fisherman
are old enough to play summer baseball and fall league basketball and that kind of stuff and man i just don't have the time to go like i want to
oh really
yeah
i tell you it really is hard to get time to go fishing you know unless you just
really work at it almost it's almost like a second job
yeah i'm i like to go after them big old black bass
oh i got a few little old ponds up around here you know there's several around here just i do a lot of oh just small farm fishing and i mean small farm tank fishing and you know rock pit fishing but i've been to
oh the last i guess the last big lake i went to was lake fork
um-hum
yes
oh are you
yeah it's
yeah that is a problem
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
that seems to be what the bass like and what you can catch with the lures so that's generally what i fish for you know because i don't particularly like to eat fish i just like to catch them and throw them back
used to go around a lot use that a lot but
like i say i kind of got out of the fishing business when the kids got up big enough so i got sold that and
but it's
well as a matter of fact last fall in
october i guess i bought i bought a boat but i bought a ski boat
gonna keep it
yeah you can it's not the same as a bass boat but yeah you can get out on the water that's the main thing
but i used to go with a friend at work quite a bit he had he had a bass boat and he's the one i went to
oh like i say we went to lake fork and cypress springs and we've been to lavon and texoma just
we kind of grounded ourselves in that respect
uh-huh
yeah that's well you don't have to but it makes it easier you got to have well if you have a texoma license you can fish anywhere on the lake
if you have only a texas license you have to stay on the texas side of the lake which as it turns out most of the lake is in oklahoma
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
go across the bridge across the water if it looks good you can just pullover and start it then
yeah now i've got most of mine hung up in the garage now like i say it's been a while since i've
since i've even gotten to go
pretty days
like today like this weekend of course it's too windy now but you know it usually dies down around sundown i've got a little old pond just
oh just a few hundred yards from my back door that i go over there occasionally but
you know it's pretty small and got pretty small fish in it but
it's nice to get out and just start splashing on the water or something
no i don't take any magazines but i like to watch old berry stokes
yeah he's about my favorite
oh really
yeah
yeah that's yeah i have taken some fishing magazines in the past and that's generally what i found that seemed like they spend a lot of time
discussing the type fishing that i wasn't really interested in
yeah
yeah
yeah it's really more kind of all over the south isn't it
yeah
yeah what do you get when you when you join the b a s what kind of benefits to you get
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah tackle and stuff
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i've noticed they they're now
pushing a mastercard that you know they're supposed to spend so much of the money on conservation measures and stuff
which is a good idea i guess
oh yeah
yeah especially as popular as fishing is getting you know in the last few years last five or ten years i guess it's really picked up in popularity again
so it's a lot more
you know a lot more people using the lakes and facilities and putting more pressure on the fish and taking more fish out of the lakes
no i haven't
yeah now ray roberts i haven't been over there but i've i understand there's quite a few people who have been i think that's really going to be a good bass lake
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i understand it's kind of kind of restricted or doesn't have easy access really
yeah
which is a yeah which is all right you know that that's all you can do that's all you can do but
it's good to get out there and like i say throw the lure out and just
just piddle with it a little while
yeah
yeah some of them it takes a little while to get them to do what you think they ought to be done
uh-huh yeah
yeah yes it's just that pork skin
which you know you can get the artificial pork or you can use the real slab of pork but yeah that's what it is it just
yeah uh-huh
that's what is amazing you know all these different rigs that people come up with you know the carolina worm rig and the like i said the jig and pig but
i'd i like top water fishing myself you know everybody said
hi
you don't at all
um-hum
or too much of it yeah you need
oh uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i haven't been up there but i understand they've got a nice pool and that's my favorite form of exercise is swimming
oh yeah most of my forms of exercise come in the form of a five year old and a two year old
and running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little exploration hike you know through the neighborhood it's amazing you know how many earthworms you can find and
and to a five year old they're they never get old you know an earthworm every single time she finds one it's a brand new exciting activity for her
um-hum it really is
um-hum
oh yeah isn't it great
um-hum
um-hum
well that's neat my husband was a boy scout and he actually went very far in the boy scouts and he was in the order of the arrow and he absolutely
you know the earth is part of him
and he is part of it and i think that's a real important thing and we enjoy going camping we haven't yet had them sleeping on the ground primarily because
to them or to the five year old the two year old would freak out about it but she wouldn't quite get totally unnerved but the five year old still has a fear of spiders
isn't that a beautiful place
well it was up there actually that she got her fear of spiders because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time we you know we'd never seen one
so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been terrified of spiders since
but we still go up there and we still have a great time
um-hum
i think not i think it was you know being in a new place being kind of out of out of sorts and everything all combined but
both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but our life doesn't really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our family you know
well
yeah we have a
that's kind of how we feel about it we can't you know there's
and we really have a great time with it i'm sure that's the way that you felt with your boys
oh with walt disney world and
by night
they were trying to turn it too much into a business
gone down to the new braunfels san well we were headed down to sea world in san antonio
and we stopped along the way and enjoyed ourselves along the way but you know that's pretty much as far as we've tried with little ones
um-hum
oh um-hum
um-hum
and no reason to be
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
it's just off the interstate that goes through hot springs
okay
well that wouldn't even be a very far drive
i'm not i ought to look into it because we were kind of
entertaining the thought of taking a you know like just a five or six day trip in the not too distant future to kind of kick off the summer
and i
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
i probably wouldn't and i've lived here all of my life
oh yes i have i have been to tyler that was one place we went when i was a child
we've not taken our children though
uh-huh
texarkana uh-huh
we ought to head out
we
um-hum ah
right
yeah
yeah well i certainly will
jack it's been real it's been real informative for me to talk with you and i certainly enjoyed it
okay
uh-huh it sure is
all right what did you look for when you were looking for child care
i guess that's an important
i haven't thought about that as much as i
it
day school
so they're kids before they went to school and
well what we had done was talk to the parents of the kids that were there
and all the parents were very enthusiastic so we thought well that's a that's a good point and then we visited once and seemed like they were pretty
but i guess there is a difference between
day care for kids that are
couple years away from school and
child care for now you and your wife both work right
so
uh-huh
i guess with the right person if as opposed to some of these day care centers where they have
to rely on
it's much easier to rely on one person if they're good they're good and if they're bad well you know
well on the average on the well on the average they might do
gosh how should i say this
you're going for the average the average kid is going to be treated better but
but you won't have the
you won't have the risk of getting a real bad one everybody knows that they've got a bad one on the other hand that's with a person who's taking care of them in their own home that's
if they're good like i say you can be pretty sure that they're good and so i if they're not so good if they're kind of lazy why the kid's probably
could tell you i personally would rather have my kids
stay with
you know with an individual than i would with a school because with a school if they lose if they have two or three good people and they lose one you'll never know it you just pick your kid up from school and
and see the other question i had is
so do you plan on keeping her in day care until she goes to school
does this lady have any help or does she do it all herself
okay i wondered about that because i know some people that do that and
i share your sense when you change job to work or job to home the way your image of the machine changes i tend to do slightly different things at home than i do at work
i use one two three a lot the lotus product as a spreadsheet and i have i use a
what you see is what you get editor for almost all of my word processing so i have not although i have access at home to things like works and wordperfect
but i do obviously notice it i think the thing that surprises me most when i change work to home environment is the cursor speed and after i if initially get over the cursor speed in the sense of moving linearly across the screen
as opposed to tabbing
i'm a touch typer and i haven't ever really noticed
differences the machine tends to react as fast as i can i use an as a matter of fact use an eighty eight at home which is really old iron
probably ten years or so and at the office i am indeed using a three eighty six
i use a pc for a great deal of things in private life i'm a church treasurer
and i use the machine a lot on a data base and financial package that operates at the church office i do some volunteer work at home using
a buttons pc file program that is a very simplistic relational data base for labels and things so i guess i would have to say on a home setting i'm probably on
the personal computer as much as an hour a day on average at home
i don't have
a concern too much about the speed however because most of the applications i find are as fast as i am if not more so and i tend to notice it more when it
comes down to an issue of peripherals at work i'm used to various batch printing capabilities and pretty high-speed output either laser printer
or machines like ibm thirty eight twenty high speed
apa printers and so i get frustrated watching things slowly come out upon my matrix printer more so than i do over access speed
i
guess that i have gotten to the point where if i didn't have the personal computer
i would be impacted a great deal on the things that i do in my life i'm sure i would probably find ways to return to what i was doing in nineteen eighty one when i
got my first home computer but it would be i think a dramatic sense of loss on some items
no i have access to spell correction material i
i seldom use it although when i'm at the office and i'm producing work correspondence i run about ninety per cent of my office work on a mainframe
i execute on a three eighty six machine that is attached to the mainframe as a as a intelligent work station but i use it
frequently as a dumbhead to get to the mainframe and there i tend on almost all of my editing and stuff to be using some fairly powerful
editors and word processors and wordproof but surprisingly at home and i seldom ever bother or worry about it too much
i guess ultimately i'm not a horribly bad speller although i have a tendency to lisp when i type so to speak
nothing that that's particularly horrible and i think most of the work word processing i do since it's somewhat of a personal nature i've probably don't have a sense of vulnerability
in this in the even that i were to send a misspelled word out the way one might have at the office place
okay
right
that's
that's an interesting point i think a the more i as i've thought about
our conversation i realize that one of the things that perhaps causes me not to get a jarring difference between the two locations is that at the office i'm doing work things that in some ways are dissimilar from what i do at home
and as a result i don't get the comparative feel
i suspect if i were coming home and trying to do some of the projects i do at the office i would go crazy on my on my machine i haven't tended to play the games and do the applications at work that i do at home so i probably have never been in
noticed how wonderful it might be i suspect lotus one two three and spreadsheet application might be the one common thread
and there i think that even though i'm on an eighty eight at home
that the speed is really quite adequate and i consequently don't even really notice the difference between the fast machine and the eighty eight
right i do have some retirement modeling that i've done at home that tends to crawl which on which i've just turned the calculation off in between and a couple of models that i've
built for school purposes that i start in the evening and then go to bed and get them the next morning but they would have run an hour and a half even on a thirty three eighty six machine i imagine so
i suspect that what happens is that you get to the point where it's so long that from a human being perspective there's not much difference between six hours and an hour and a half
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
oh really
hum
um-hum
uh-huh
hum
right
right
yeah i that is that is something i've heard i had a friend that i worked with that was from sweden and that was
probably the major concern i have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of
of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to get into the medical field but at the same time
the competition
in a lot of ways is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor and
they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable but at the same time there's a
you know they're regulating themselves and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for
my i have a brother who's a vet and for something that he can get you know wholesale and i'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they hospitals buy in such a bulk rate
you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item and that's ridiculous and i don't think that is that is abnormal in any means to be doing things like that and
i don't think that is that is abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all
yeah and so it's i think i to me i think something that's going to help our medical arena is for
and i don't know how to i don't know how to do this but i think people are too lawsuit happy and i mean things will happen and you've got to
keep up or you've got to realize that you know it is just men or women that are that are making decisions and they will make mistakes and
you know if people you know there are some people that i'm sure make mistakes because they just
don't keep on top of it but there are other things that just happen that you can't you know you can't
say you know well if you had just done this you know things would have done differently and
i don't know i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically
in the in the last number of years and i think that's something that if they could work on
are they doing a lot of recycling out in georgia
uh-huh
yeah i it is it is to some degree inconvenient i'd have to say that
and it's not big enough it's kind of it's kind of silly and what you do is you put out paper like paper bags and newspaper and cardboard
and that you put separately and you also put out in this little ridiculous container any cans or bottles you have you know like your campbell soup cans and your milk cartons and that kind of stuff
and then the rest you can you throw out and the town picks it up
i've heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put what's left in a clear plastic ga bag so they can kind of look and see if you're throwing out what you shouldn't i thought that was pretty amusing
i imagine i don't know
well you know it's funny we just got back from a trip to california visiting some friends near san francisco and san jose and we'd see these signs on the road that said garbage pickup two exits down or something
the for the apartment dwellers they didn't make it easy to recycle at all what they did was you would bring it to this garbage place that they designated
and the lions club or you know some community organization would do you the favor of picking it up from there you really had to go out of your way to recycle
well around here i it's not too bad because on tuesdays you put out your paper and your cans and plastic things and they go away so that i mean that's not too tough to put that at the end of your driveway
my friends in california have this special garbage fill where they collect all their soda cans and they kind of leave it near the dumpster knowing that the neighborhood kids will grab them because they can sell them or something for recycling
so they just leave it out for the vultures to take
oh well the soda cans where i live are good for a nickel a piece
so if you bring them to the local supermarket they have these can crushers and you know you throw all the cans in one at a time it takes a lot of time and you push a button and you get a nickel for every can because you had to pay a deposit on it when you bought it
and you find these old men and these bag people collecting all these things and hauling them in big garbage bags and they just like take up one of these machines to get you know couple of bucks for beer or something
yeah it's a state well new york state does it and i know vermont a lot of the eastern states do it
so you get a lot of old people one old fellow had crates of beer he made friends with a bartender at some bar and he gets all the beer bottles because the guy can't be bothered with it
and he said he bought himself i said that's pretty heavy for you isn't it and he says well i just bought myself an old station wagon to cart you know this is a real business for him he's making big bucks
well you do find people picking through the garbage pails at the beach you know my own kids have been guilty of that till they found that the bees were attracted to the coke cans and that was the end of that
we do here see what do we recycle we they recycle they have bins
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and plastic bottles
and i think that's all they have
what about you guys
uh-huh
really for smashed cans
uh-huh
oh can you can you hold on for just a minute i'm gonna try pressing one again to make sure that i pressed it hard enough because -kay just a second
oh okay well i guess
i guess
yeah okay well anyways you guys only get a penny a can well when you buy like canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit
yeah exactly and so it's like they charge you for the deposit so when you turn in the cans unsmashed you're just like reimbursed
type of thing
that's sort of nice though
uh-huh
but they have sort of like things that you you're not like reimbursed for or paid for like we can recycle clear glass brown glass green glass
and milk jugs and
newspapers you know everyone does newspapers
but that kind of stuff
but they said they can't be smashed or else it doesn't fit in their little containers and they're not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something
yeah that's
um-hum
as likely to do it yeah
yeah that's true
uh-huh yeah
yeah exactly
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh that's good
another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other
we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops
and that way you know you don't get near enough as much as you bought it for but you got the use out of it and what you're gonna basically donate to a goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
and so that's something that i've never i we're new to iowa and so that's something that i hadn't you know looked into before but that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess
okay do you have a garden
um-hum do you enjoy working out in the yard
um-hum
uh-huh i've had some roses out in my backyard too and they've done real well i was surprised
i we had some in virginia and they were real hard to keep up with but seems like they like the texas climate better
right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them in that so that they would drain because our soil is so bad
where i live do you live in texas or
plano oh yeah i'm out in rowlett and we have that brown clay soil and it's real hard to grow
anything here
uh-huh
yeah
right we've got a few things too it's hard to tell if they'll come back or not
well that's good we
we planted three pecan trees out front and every one of them died i told my husband this is the last one if it dies we're going to something else
but we dug a hole about six times as big as it needs to be and filled it with all kinds of compost and
pine needles and everything else we could think of hopefully it'll drain this year
yeah
yeah it's hard to find something that'll take the heat as well as the freezing
that we get down here i have a few little flowers i plant around the trees out front i've enjoyed
doing those i put pansies out in the winter and
they pretty much last all winter and then i put moss rose out in the summer and it just goes crazy you don't really have to do anything to it
puts a lot of color out there
all year
right
oh yeah
those do pretty well here don't they
we've got my husband put a little row of those out in the backyard to kind of
make a little cut so that the kids wouldn't come marching through the yard and everything
yeah
right yeah the only thing i don't like about them is weeding around them because they get so sharp
pricky things get in your hands
oh really
yeah we do it my husband does most of the mowing and edging and all that stuff
yeah we get something on the door about every week
uh-huh
yeah really
oh our neighbor has a lawn service come and do his and i don't think it looks any better than what my husband does so
i'm not really tempted to do that either
if
yeah i can mow the backyard but there's something about the grass in our front yard is so dense
that the mower wheels just kind of bog down in there and i can not push it
oh
really
huh
i would like a self-propelled one i think
that might make it easier
oh
yeah that's a pretty large area
really
did people up there edge as pri as strictly and stuff as they do down here
yeah
yeah i lived in a town it was a college town in virginia and i mean people kept their lawns mowed but they sure didn't get into it like they do here in texas
wasn't a source of pride or something like it is down here
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah it's hard i know we tried to do our landscaping out front my husband
tilled it up in the fall and then we've been waiting on some guy supposed to be getting us some edging for like ten cents a foot instead of about a dollar
yeah
it'd seem like they'd want to just to get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer
yeah
yeah did they not put any in your neighborhood
we had two trees in the front of our yard and then one of them died and so we that's where we keep putting that pecan
keeps dying we have i think it's a silver leaf maple or something like that that's hung on out there
right
yeah
hope ours continues to live it's been there about four i guess almost four years now so maybe it's established enough that it'll go on and survive
i like an oak trees yeah
my husband's father has a place out in east texas so he's always digging up little
red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them back and start them but
so far we haven't had much luck
oh
oh
yeah well that's too bad
we've got all of our trees from calloway's and luckily they'll take them back any time for any reason if they die so
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah i know the guy at wolfe told us they cut back on the tree warranty like six months or less
but calloway's has kept theirs forever so
yeah
yeah i don't know we haven't bought
uh-huh we haven't bought any shrubs yet hopefully
i think we've almost waited this too late this year now to start putting in anything of any size
yeah
oh really it wouldn't matter if we plant them when it was starting to get warmer
root stimulator yeah
oh well that's good to know maybe there's still hope for our front yard this summer then
uh-huh
yeah i've noticed that they haven't had anything great
right yeah
yeah except last year we thought some were dead and finally they started leafing out again at the bottom so we just cut them way back and was able to save them but this year they look even worse
um-hum
yeah
huh ours haven't done anything yet this year
yeah i like crepe myrtles they really add a lot of color
in the summer
oh really
yeah
oh
does it grow along a fence or something
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
